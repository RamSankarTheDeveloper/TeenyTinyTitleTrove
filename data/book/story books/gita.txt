Introduction
YOU ARE about to have the profound pleasure of reading one 
of the truly great books in the history of the world. Not only 
is it a spiritual monument—an essential scripture of Hinduism, 
recited daily for two millennia and to this very day, whose 
teachings have spread throughout Asia and around the globe—
it is also a literary masterpiece, the linchpin of a great epic of 
war and peace, honor and disgrace, loyalty and betrayal. It is a 
book people everywhere in the world return to again and again 
throughout their lives for insight into the nature of reality.
For the Hindu philosophers, the Bhagavad Gita was always
of great importance. It is one of the three central texts of 
Vedanta, the other two being the Brahma Sutras and the
Upanishads. From the ninth century CE onwards, philosophers 
such as Shankara, Ramanuja, Madhva, and Nimbarka in the 
Vedanta tradition, and Abhinavagupta in the Shaiva tradition, 
wrote learned commentaries on the Gita. It was also trans-
lated from Sanskrit into other Indian languages, for example, 
Jnaneshvara’s Marathi version in the thirteenth century. As a 
work of literature, the epic was immensely important to the 
cultural life of India and even beyond her shores, notably in 
Indonesia, where parts were translated into Old Javanese.
x  INTRODUCTION
It was during the British Raj that the Gita ﬁ rst achieved 
worldwide fame. Many educated Indians were struggling to 
defend Hinduism against the onslaught of western culture, and 
gradually the Gita was considered to embody the essential spirit 
and deepest truths of Hinduism. The Hindu reformer Ram 
Mohun Roy referred to the Gita as “the essence of all shastras,” 
or the essence of all scriptures. By 1912, C. F. Andrews could 
claim that the Gita had become a common and well-read 
scripture for the whole of educated India. It also appealed to 
another, and very different group of people, the Theosophists. 
It was the Theosophists who introduced the Gita to that most 
famous of all modern Indians: Mohandas K. Gandhi.
Since Gandhi was introduced to the Gita by the Theoso-
phists, he learned to read it in an allegorical way. The mighty 
battle was really a struggle for truth—which he saw as another 
word for God—to be sought through love, and love ruled out 
violence. Ahimsa, or nonviolence, became the key to Gandhi’s 
understanding of the Gita, which he called his “spiritual dic-
tionary.” He was particularly fascinated by two words: apari-
graha (nonpossession), which suggested the renunciation of 
money and property to avoid cramping the life of the spirit; 
and samabhava (equability), which asked him to transcend 
pain or pleasure, victory or defeat, and to work without hope 
of success or fear of failure. The Gita became an inspiration to 
Gandhi and millions of his followers, a manual of devotion and 
action in the modern world.
The Gita also found a rapt audience in the West, and a fas-
cinating global cross-fertilization followed. It appealed both 
to the German Romantics, notably Schlegel, Humboldt, and 
Goethe, and to the American Transcendentalists, a group in 
New England who thought that insights which transcended 
INTRODUCTION  xi
logic and experience would reveal the deepest truths. The Gita 
was ﬁ rst translated into English in India in 1785 by Charles 
Wilkins, a merchant with the East India Company, and his 
translation made a deep impression on the Transcendentalist’s 
leader, Ralph Waldo Emerson. Emerson’s poem, “Brahma,” 
elegantly captures some of the essence of the Gita:
If the red slayer think he slays,
 Or if the slain think he is slain,
They know not well the subtle ways
 I keep, and pass, and turn again.
Far or forgot to me is near;
 Shadow and sunlight are the same;
The vanished gods to me appear;
 and one to me are shame and fame.
They reckon ill who leave me out;
 When me they ﬂ y, I am the wings;
I am the doubter and the doubt,
 And I the hymn the Brahmin sings.
The strong gods pine for my abode,
 And pine in vain the sacred Seven;
But thou, meek lover of the good!
 Find me, and turn thy back on heaven.
The poem is based on a verse found in both the Gita and 
the Katha Upanishad. (A century later, another great poet,
T. S. Eliot, also had a lifelong interest in Indian philosophy 
and incorporated it into his poetry as well.) Emerson made 
xii  INTRODUCTION
the Gita required reading for all those who were in rebellion 
against evangelical Christianity. Thus, for the ﬁ rst time, the 
Gita became part of a counterculture.
Another Transcendentalist, Henry David Thoreau, was a 
tremendous enthusiast of the Gita, but his interest was also a 
practical one. He incorporated a version of the Gita’s teaching 
on Karma Yoga into his own lifestyle and philosophy. In 1849, 
he launched the idea of civil disobedience—an idea that inﬂ u-
enced Gandhi’s political thinking. Thus, an Indic idea passed 
through a Western mind and returned transformed to India. 
(Similarly, the Theosophical Society was founded in New York 
City, moved its headquarters to India, and was a catalyst in the 
revival of Hinduism and Buddhism.) And of course, Gandhi’s 
ideas ﬂ owed back westward to inspire two other giants of the
twentieth century, Martin Luther King Jr. and Nelson Mandela.
The current tidal wave of interest in the Gita, in Yoga, and 
in things Indian began in the 1960s with the efﬂ orescence 
of another counterculture, the paperback revolution in book 
publishing, the new, far-reaching curricula of a higher edu-
cational system undergoing explosive growth, and the arrival 
in the West of gurus such as Swami Vishnudevananda, Swami 
Satchidananda, and A. C. Bhaktivedanta, all following in the 
footsteps of Swami Vivekananda.
Today, the Bhagavad Gita is ﬁ rmly established around the 
world as a true classic. But not a dusty old classic: It is aston-
ishingly fresh and inspiring, even to readers who do not share 
the underlying assumptions of the text. Knowledge and self-
discipline are still virtues. Selﬂ essness is as sound today as 
it was then. Doing one’s duty regardless of consequences is 
needed now more than ever. We may not share the Gita’s views 
on caste or endorse the social system it supports, but we don’t 
INTRODUCTION  xiii
have to. We are free to choose, and the Gita offers a number 
of choices. Its core of universal values and its poetic grandeur 
make the Gita a living classic.
I mentioned earlier that the Gita is the linchpin of a great 
epic, and that epic is the Mahabharata, or Great Story of the 
Bharatas. With nearly one hundred thousand verses divided 
into eighteen books, it is one of the longest epic poems in the 
world—fully seven times longer than the Iliad and the Odyssey 
combined, or three times longer than the Bible. It is in fact a 
whole library of stories that exerted a tremendous inﬂ uence on 
the people and literature of India.
The central story of the Mahabharata is a conﬂ ict over suc-
cession to the throne of Hastinapura, a kingdom just north 
of modern Delhi that was the ancestral realm of a tribe most 
commonly known as the Bharatas. (India was at that time 
divided amongst many small, and often warring, kingdoms.) 
The struggle is between two groups of cousins, the Pandavas, 
or sons of Pandu, and the Kauravas, or descendants of Kuru. 
Because of his blindness, Dhritarashtra, the elder brother of 
Pandu, is passed over as king, the throne going instead to Pandu. 
However, Pandu renounces the throne, and Dhritarashtra
assumes power after all. The sons of Pandu—Yudhishthira, 
Bhima, Arjuna, Nakula, and Sahadeva—grow up together 
with their cousins, the Kauravas. Due to enmity and jealousy, 
the Pandavas are forced to leave the kingdom when their 
father dies. During their exile, they jointly marry Draupadi 
and befriend their cousin Krishna, who from then on accom-
panies them. They return and share sovereignty with the 
Kauravas, but have to withdraw to the forest for thirteen years 
when Yudhishthira loses all his possessions in a game of dice 
with Duryodhana, the eldest of the Kauravas. When they 
xiv  INTRODUCTION
return from the forest to demand their share of the kingdom 
back, Duryodhana refuses. This means war. Krishna acts as 
counselor to the Pandavas. The Gita is found right here, with 
the two armies facing each other and ready for battle. The 
battle rages for eighteen days and ends with the defeat of the 
Kauravas. All the Kauravas die; only the ﬁ ve Pandava brothers 
and Krishna survive. The six set out for heaven together, but 
all die on the way, except Yudhishthira, who reaches the gates 
of heaven accompanied only by a small dog, who turns out to 
be an incarnation of the god Dharma. After tests of faithful-
ness and constancy, Yudhishthira is reunited in heaven with his 
brothers and Draupadi in eternal bliss.
It is within this enormous epic—the sizable book you hold 
in your hands is well less than one percent of the Mahabharata
that we ﬁ nd the Bhagavad Gita, or the Song of the Lord, most 
commonly referred to simply as the Gita. It is found in the sixth 
book of the epic, just before the great battle between the Pandavas 
and the Kauravas. The greatest hero of the Pandavas, Arjuna, 
has pulled up his chariot in the middle of the battleﬁ eld between 
the two opposing armies. He is accompanied by Krishna, who 
acts as his charioteer. In a ﬁ t of despondency, Arjuna throws 
down his bow and refuses to ﬁ ght, deploring the immorality of 
the coming war. It is a moment of supreme drama: time stands 
still, the armies are frozen in place, and God speaks.
The situation is extremely grave. A great kingdom is about 
to self-destruct in internecine warfare, making a mockery of 
dharma, the eternal moral laws and customs that govern the 
universe. Arjuna’s objections are well founded: He is the victim 
of a moral paradox. On the one hand, he is facing persons who, 
according to dharma, deserve his respect and veneration. On 
the other hand, his duty as a warrior demands that he kill them. 
INTRODUCTION  xv
Yet no fruits of victory would seem to justify such a heinous 
crime. It is, seemingly, a dilemma without solution. It is this 
state of moral confusion that the Gita sets out to mend.
When Arjuna refuses to ﬁ ght, Krishna has no patience 
with him. Only when he realizes the extent of Arjuna’s despon-
dency does Krishna change his attitude and start teaching 
the mysteries of dharmic action in this world. He intro-
duces Arjuna to the structure of the universe, the concepts 
of prakriti, primordial nature, and the three gunas, the prop-
erties that are active in prakriti. Then he takes Arjuna on a 
tour of philosophical ideas and ways of salvation. He discusses 
the nature of theory and action, the importance of ritual, the 
ultimate principle, Brahman, all the while gradually disclosing 
his own nature as the highest god. This part of the Gita culmi-
nates in an overwhelming vision: Krishna allows Arjuna to see 
his supernal form, the Vishvarupa, which strikes terror into 
Arjuna’s heart. The rest of the Gita deepens and supplements 
the ideas presented before the epiphany—the importance of 
self-control and faith, of equanimity and unselﬁ shness, but 
above all, of bhakti, or devotion. Krishna explains to Arjuna 
how he can obtain immortality by transcending the proper-
ties which qualify not only primordial matter, but also human 
character and behavior. Krishna also emphasizes the impor-
tance of doing one’s duty, declaring that it is better to do one’s 
own duty without distinction than to do another’s duty well. 
In the end, Arjuna is convinced. He picks up his bow and is 
ready to ﬁ ght.
Knowing a couple of things will make your reading easier. 
The ﬁ rst is that the Gita is a conversation within a conversa-
tion. Dhritarashtra begins it by asking a question, and that is 
the last we hear out of him. He is answered by Sanjaya, who 
xvi  INTRODUCTION
relates what is happening on the battleﬁ eld. (It is actually more 
dramatic and wondrous than the previous sentence indicates. 
Dhritarashtra is blind. Vyasa, his father, offers to restore his 
sight so he can follow the battle. Dhritarashtra declines this 
boon, feeling that seeing the carnage of his kinsmen would be 
more than he could bear. So instead, Vyasa bestows clairvoy-
ance and clairaudience upon Sanjaya, Dhritarashtra’s minister 
and charioteer. As they sit in their palace, Sanjaya relates what 
he sees and hears on the distant battleﬁ eld.) Sanjaya pops up 
now and again throughout the book as he relates to Dhrita-
rashtra the conversation between Krishna and Arjuna. This 
second conversation is a bit one-sided, as Krishna does almost 
all of the talking. Thus, Sanjaya describes the situation, Arjuna 
asks the questions, and Krishna gives the answers.
The second thing to be aware of is the profusion of 
nicknames, also known as epithets. Almost all other translations 
either omit them or normalize them for simplicity’s sake. Thus, 
Hrishikesha, Keshava, Govinda, and many other names will be 
left out or just translated as Krishna, and Son of Pritha, Son of 
Kunti, Mighty-armed Prince, Bharata, and many other epithets 
will be omitted or reduced to Arjuna. To maintain ﬁ delity to 
the original, I am retaining all of them. They also make the 
text more ﬂ avorful and interesting, provide insight into Indian 
culture, and indeed into the story itself. For example, Krishna 
uses epithets of Arjuna that remind him of his royal lineage, his 
prowess in battle, and so on, to ease his dejection. They are also 
meaningful to our Indian readers. If you ﬁ nd them confusing, 
please turn to the back of the book, where you will ﬁ nd a com-
prehensive glossary explaining all the names and nicknames. 
Many of these names are still in use, so you may well ﬁ nd some 
of your friends and acquaintances listed there.
INTRODUCTION  xvii
Unfortunately, one thing I cannot do to make your reading 
easier is completely explain everything in the Gita. That would 
be beyond the scope of an introduction, or even an entire book. 
For devotees and scholars alike, the Gita—and all the questions 
it raises—can absorb a lifetime of study. The YogaVidya.com 
web site lists dozens of books for further reading. I can, 
however, alert you to one fact about the Gita that will save you 
a lot of anguish and frustration: It contradicts itself. This was 
recognized early on and was cited by Shankara as the reason for 
writing his commentary.
Many explanations have been put forward to explain how 
theism, asceticism, dualism, pantheism, pragmatic material-
ism, Yoga, Vedanta, and even Buddhism, all got woven into the 
text. One is that, at the time the Gita was written, the various 
systems of philosophy were not yet rigid and standardized, nor 
conceived of as being mutually exclusive. Another is that it is a 
work of mysticism and devotion, and is not intended to be logical 
or systematic. Another is that the text has the practical aim of 
salvation and is content to tolerantly lay out a variety of options. 
A variation on this view is that the options are graded according 
to simplicity or difﬁ culty, with the way of knowledge being the 
most difﬁ cult and the way of devotion being the simplest and 
most efﬁ cient. Still another is to assign a hierarchy of truths 
to the statements in the Gita, so that some tell a simple truth 
and others reveal a higher truth. It should be noted that we still 
live with intellectual inconsistencies and levels of truth even in 
the modern world. For instance, we simultaneously believe in 
and utilize the classical mechanics of Newton and the relativ-
ity theory of Einstein. Both theories are true at the same time, 
but not on the same level. The inconsistencies of the Gita may 
xviii  INTRODUCTION
have been as undisturbing to the ancients as the inconsistencies 
in our own theories of reality are to us.
Who would’ve written such a complicated book? Indian 
tradition holds that the entire Mahabharata was written by 
Vyasa, and many traditional pandits still hold this view. Modern 
scholarship has arrived at a more complex answer: There is no 
single author or single date of composition, and it began as oral 
poetry. A reciter would have had to know the story, but his 
reputation depended upon his skill in bringing the traditional 
material to life. Then as now, a ﬁ rst-class narrator was much in 
demand. We know from other oral-poetry traditions that the 
same bard would present the same story in different versions, 
longer or shorter as it suited the occasion. Thus, in its oral 
form, the epic had a reasonably ﬁ xed core, but its performance 
was highly ﬂ exible, with additions, embellishments, and digres-
sions made on the spot to please the audience. In addition, oral 
poets had at their disposal a large number of formulaic expres-
sions that could be easily ﬁ tted into the epic’s sixteen-syllable 
meter in which the length of only a few syllables was ﬁ xed. The 
original nucleus of the epic may have been the creation of a 
single bard, or possibly a small group of bards, but it is now 
irrecoverable. It is likely to have been substantially shorter 
than the Mahabharata’s shortest recorded version of twenty-
four thousand verses, although we shouldn’t underestimate the 
ability of oral cultures to produce very long texts.
An educated guess would suggest that the origin of the 
Mahabharata lies sometime during the eighth or ninth centuries 
BCE, although some scholars consider the roots of the epic to be 
much older. Among the specialists, there is now general agree-
ment that the oldest portions of the epic that have been preserved 
are not likely to be older than 400 BCE. On the other end, it is 
INTRODUCTION  xix
difﬁ cult to ﬁ x an upper limit for the Mahabharata’s composition. 
The didactic portions of the twelfth book in particular seem to 
have been added very late, perhaps in the fourth century CE.
Looking more speciﬁ cally at the Gita, most scholars think 
the oldest parts may go back to the third century BCE, whereas 
the theistic portions may stem from the middle or end of the 
second century BCE. Chapters twelve through ﬁ fteen may date 
from the ﬁ rst century CE, whereas chapter seventeen is possibly 
even younger. The Gita was likely composed somewhere in 
north-central India, perhaps in modern Haryana or western 
Uttar Pradesh. These conclusions would probably hold good 
whether we believe that the Gita was a work originally separate 
from the Mahabharata, as some claim, or that it was originally 
part of the great epic. Even if the Gita was not originally a 
single unit or part of the epic, it has by now been handed down 
and read that way for many centuries.
We don’t know when the Mahabharata was ﬁ rst written 
down. Possibly it was a gradual process, where parts of the epic 
were put into manuscripts, whereas other parts were still trans-
mitted orally. Whenever the process started, there were only two 
possibilities: in the north, birch bark was used; and in the south, 
palm leaves. These are brittle materials, and frequent recopying 
was required if the text wasn’t to be lost. The earliest surviving 
manuscript is from the ninth century CE. An owner of a man-
uscript could do with it as he pleased, and books consisting of 
leaves bound together with string allow other leaves to be easily 
inserted. The quality of the copying varied with the scribe—
a bad scribe might make errors, and a better scribe might sub-
sequently improve the text. All these processes created a lack of 
consistency, so we should not be surprised at the great variety 
amongst the different versions, or recensions, of the text.

The Gita ﬁ rst rolled off a printing press before there were 
complete editions of the Mahabharata itself. As noted earlier, it 
was translated into English for the ﬁ rst time in 1785 by Charles 
Wilkins. The ﬁ rst Sanskrit edition came out in 1806 under the 
supervision of Sir William Jones. In 1823, the German scholar 
August Wilhelm von Schlegel produced a ﬁ rst-class edition 
of the Gita and added a Latin translation. The ﬁ rst printed 
edition of the Mahabharata was the so-called Calcutta edition, 
completed in 1839, which was based on the Bengali recension 
of the text. The next attempt was the Bombay edition, largely 
based on the recension in Devanagari script and completed in 
1863. The Kumbhakonam edition of 1910 incorporated the 
southern recension.
This situation was clearly less than satisfactory, so one of the 
greatest scholarly undertakings of the twentieth century was 
begun in 1919 at the Bhandarkar Oriental Research Institute 
in Poona (now spelled Pune). No less than ten distinguished 
editors, initially led by V. S. Sukthankar, and a host of assis-
tants labored for forty-seven years to produce the deﬁ nitive 
edition of the Mahabharata. The objective was to reconstruct 
the oldest possible form of the text on the basis of hundreds of 
manuscripts collected from all over the Indian subcontinent 
and Indonesia. The resulting set of nineteen volumes, con-
taining thirteen thousand pages, was completed in 1966. I am 
very pleased that the Institute granted us permission to include 
their deﬁ nitive Sanskrit edition of the Gita in this book, and 
we have taken great pains to present it to you in the beautiful 
Devanagari script—an extremely rare event outside of India. I 
would also like to thank Dr. John Smith, who has made an elec-
tronic text of the Mahabharata available on the Internet.
INTRODUCTION  xxi
The situation regarding English translations today is also 
less than satisfactory—in fact, quite surprisingly so, given 
that the Gita has been translated into English literally hun-
dreds of times over the last two centuries. The publisher of 
YogaVidya.com carefully examined more than a dozen of the 
most highly regarded translations with an eye toward reissuing 
the best one. Instead, he found them astonishingly deﬁ cient. 
Some stayed so close to the Indic syntax that they were unread-
able in English. Others strayed so far from the original text that 
they were merely unreliable paraphrases. Still others suffered 
from ugly transliteration or amateur versiﬁ cation. Some others 
were distorted by the beliefs or egoism of the translator. And 
yet others were deformed by their publishers’ marketing 
departments, always on the lookout for new hooks and angles. 
So the publisher asked me to have a go at it, and I have 
tried my best to sidestep these shortcomings and avoid intro-
ducing new ones. I made great efforts to produce a translation 
that is both highly accurate and true to the original Sanskrit. I 
refrained from using verse, since that would militate against the 
objective of accuracy. As previously mentioned, unlike almost 
all other translations, all the names and epithets have been 
retained. If the phrasing in a particular sentence strikes you as 
strained or odd, more often than not it is from attempting to 
stay true to the original. I did not gloss over the inconsisten-
cies and difﬁ culties in the Gita, nor did I cover up uncomfort-
able topics such as sacriﬁ ces, caste, sexism, and the morality 
of war. (Although usually read as the story of a man seeking 
insight and salvation, the Gita can also be read as the story of 
a man with a conscience being taught to forget it.) And when 
questions arose, I consulted both Shankara’s and Ramanuja’s 
commentaries. At the same time, I sweated over every word, 
xxii  INTRODUCTION
phrase, and punctuation mark to make the translation as clear 
and smooth as possible, using up-to-date terminology and 
international standard written English. Finally, I dispensed 
with footnotes so that you could relish this great work of lit-
erature without interruptions. Again, consult the bibliography 
online if you wish to delve deeper into the philosophical issues 
in the Gita.
Now for some speciﬁ cs. The Indic conceptual system is 
very different from the Western system: It is often well-nigh 
impossible to ﬁ nd English terms that are semantically coex-
tensive with the Indic terms. All translations of Sanskrit phil-
osophical terms are therefore approximations, and many are 
disputed. Moreover, the exact meaning of a word is also deter-
mined by the philosophical and religious context in which it is 
used. Although other translators have made other choices in 
some instances, I have chosen to translate jnana with knowledge, 
vijnana with discrimination, and vidya with wisdom or science, 
depending upon context. I have chosen to translate the term 
guna with property, which I believe gives a better meaning 
than the often-used quality or constituent. Since sattva causes 
illumination because of its purity, I have chosen to translate the 
term with clarity rather than purity or goodness. Rajas, often 
translated as passion, I have translated as agitation in order to 
better bring out the physical aspect of the term. As for tamas, 
I have chosen sluggishness, again to emphasize the physical 
aspect. I have translated siddhas as perfected ones and karma 
mostly as action. However, karma has become an English 
loanword meaning “consequence of action.” Where I found 
this to be the meaning, I have rendered karma as karma.
I have chosen to keep the Indic term Brahman even though 
it is not a normal loanword in English. The reason is that we 
INTRODUCTION  xxiii
don’t have any word that really comes close to Brahman. The 
German scholar Paul Hacker sees it as primeval matter, but 
this in my opinion brings it too close to prakriti, which I have 
translated as primordial nature. Primeval energy may be better, 
but is not entirely satisfactory either: the immovable pole star, 
for instance, is identiﬁ ed with the unchanging Brahman. In 
the Vedas, Brahman relates especially to the power inherent in 
the mantras. A later text, the Hiranyakeshi Grihyasutra, says it is 
the navel of the universe and the navel of the pranas (breaths). 
Generally, Brahman stands for the Absolute, the source of 
everything, and is sometimes understood as a nonconscious 
principle, and sometimes as a conscious one, or God. The term, 
quite simply, can be interpreted many ways. I have therefore 
preferred to give this brief explanation of the term Brahman 
rather than translate it. Its adjectival form is Brahmic.
The word Yoga in various forms occurs almost one 
hundred and ﬁ fty times in the Gita. It is a complex term, and 
allows for a number of different interpretations, all dependent 
upon the context. The basic meaning is yoke—Yoga is in fact 
etymologically related to the English word yoke—but through 
various metaphorical processes the word came to cover a much 
wider semantic ﬁ eld. The Gita predates by a few centuries 
classical Yoga as we know it today, so in the Gita the word 
Yoga most often means simply mental discipline, or just disci-
pline or training, while a yogi is a master of such discipline. It 
also refers to more speciﬁ c forms of discipline, such as Karma 
Yoga (which I translated as the discipline of action) and Bhakti 
Yoga (translated as the discipline of devotion), and to creative 
or magical power. In the colophons, Yoga means a reﬂ ection or 
meditation upon a given subject.
xxiv  INTRODUCTION
In the end, a translation is always an interpretation, but 
an interpretation is not always a translation. The only way 
to get a truly intimate understanding of a Sanskrit text is to 
learn Sanskrit. Just by the way, although its concepts can be 
slippery and elusive, the vocabulary and grammar of the Gita 
are actually quite straightforward. If you were to learn Sanskrit, 
you could read the Gita in the original quite early in your 
studies. That is one very important reason why we included 
the Sanskrit in this book.
You may be interested to know that each chapter of the 
Gita was originally untitled. We have followed the tradi-
tional practice of pulling chapter titles from the colophons, 
those delightfully ﬂ owery sentences that bring each chapter 
to a satisfying close. Each and every chapter title could have 
begun with “The Yoga of” but we omitted this phrase to avoid 
excessive repetition and confusing constructions. We also took 
the opportunity to shorten and simplify the colophons, which 
can be very long and highly complex.
Finally, casting aside for a moment the historical conun-
drums, the scholarly debates, and the technical minutia, just 
know one thing: You are about to read one of the world’s truly 
great books. It is essential reading for a nontrivial under-
standing of Hinduism, of India, and indeed of life itself. The 
Bhagavad Gita still speaks to people everywhere—across the 
oceans, across the millennia, and across the boundaries of 
language, religion, and culture.

Luminous
AT LAST, an edition of the Bhagavad Gita that 
speaks with unprecedented ﬁ delity and clarity. 
This book contains a particularly informative 
introduction, the Sanskrit text of the Bhandarkar 
Oriental Research Institute’s critical edition, an 
unparalleled new English translation, a compre-
hensive glossary of names and nicknames, and a 
thorough index.
“This is a luminous translation that performs the 
exceptional feat of bringing the Gita fully alive 
in a Western language, combining accuracy with 
accessibility. In our troubled times, humanity 
needs the message of this sacred scripture as 
never before.”
—Karen Armstrong, author of A History of God 
and The Great Transformation
