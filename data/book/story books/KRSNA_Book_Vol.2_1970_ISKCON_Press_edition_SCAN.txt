The most comprehensive and authorita· 
tivc 
Vedic 
scriptural 
literature 
is 
the 
Srimad-Bhiiguvatam ( "The Beautiful Story 
of 
the Personality of 
Godhead"), 
the 
mature contribution of Srila Vyasadeva, 
the compiler of the Vedas. Of the twelve 
cantos of Srimad-Bhiigavatam, the tenth 
canto is considered the most confidential, 
since it describes all the transcendental 
pastimes of Sri K:�r:a, the Supreme Per· 
sonality of Godhead. K[§[W is a summary 
study 
of 
the tenth 
canto of Srimad­
Bhiigavatam. 
The activities of K:�r:a, which appear to 
be like those of an ordinary human being, 
can only be properly understood with the 
help of a bona fide spiritual master fully 
realized in the knowledge of this transcen­
dental nature. A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami 
Prabhupada is authorized by an unbreak­
able disciplic succession of spiritual mas­
ters going back thousands of years to the 
time when K:�pa appeared. Because he is 
the representative of the disciplic suc­
cession for this age and because of his 
complete immersion in love of K:�r:a 
Prabhupada is uniquely qualified to pre­
sent K:�pa as He is. 
Sakadeva Gosvami, the original speaker 
of Srimad-Bhiigavatam, has declared that 
there are three classes of men and that the 
pastimes of K:�r:a will be relished by each 
of them. The liberated soul who is no 
longer interested in mundane topics most 
certainly hears about K:�r:a with the high­
est plea:;ure. The person who is trying to 
become liberated \\ill abo enjoy these 
topic:; of the Pen,onality of Godhead. 
which 
purify anyone who hears them. 
And e\en the gross materialist will enjoy 
hearing about K:::r:a because of the resem­
blance between His affairs with the gopis 
and the 10\ing affairs of ordinary boys and 
girls. 
Forseeing the publication of this book, 
\\ith it:- fifty-eight full-color illustrations, 
Prabhupada commented. 
··\' o other reli­
gion haz ;ouch

think our K�[la book will convince them.

l I The Story of the Syamantaka Jewel 
There was a king of the name Satrajit within the jurisdiction of 
Dvarakadhama. He was a great devotee of the sun-god, who awarded him 
the benediction of a jewel known as Syamantaka. Because of this Syaman­
taka jewel, there was a misunderstanding between King Satrajit and the 
Yadu dynasty. Later on the matter was settled when Satrajit voluntarily 
offered KH�a his daughter, Satyabhama, along with the jewel Syamantaka. 
Not only was Satyabhama married to Kr��a on account of the Syamantaka 
jewel, but Jambavati, the daughter of Jambavan, was also married to Kr��a. 
These two marriages took place before the appearance of Pradyumna, as 
described in the last chapter. How King Satrajit offended the Y adu 
dynasty and how he later on came to his senses and offered his daughter 
and the Syamantaka jewel to Kr��a is described as follows. 
Since he was a great devotee of the sun-god, King Satrajit gradually 
entered into a very friendly relation�hip with him. The sun-god was much 
pleased with him and delivered to him an exceptional jewel known as 
Syamantaka. When this jewel was worn by Satrajit in a locket around his 
neck, he appeared exactly like an imitation sun-god. Putting on this jewel, 
he would enter the city of Dvaraka, and people would think that the sun� 
god had come into the city to see Kr��a. They knew that Kr��a, being the 
Supreme Personality of Godhead, was sometimes visited by the demigods, 
so while Satrajit was visiting the city of Dvaraka all the inhabitants except 
Kr��a took him to be the sun-god himself. Although King Satrajit was 
known to everyone, he could not be recognized because of the dazzling 
effulgence of the Syamantaka jewel. 
Once, mistaking him to be the sun-god, some of the important citizens 
of Dvaraka immediately went to KH�a to inform Him that the sun-god had 
arrived to see Him. At that time, Kr��a was playing chess. One of the 
important residents of Dvaraka spoke thus; "My dear Lord Naraya�a, You 
I 
,j 
2 
Kr��a, the Supreme Personality of Godhead 
are the Supreme Personality of Godhead. In Your plenary portion of 
Naraya�a or Vi��u, You have four hands with different symbols-the 
conchshell, disc, club and lotus flower. You are actually the owner of 
everything, but in spite of Your being the Supreme Personality of God­
head, Naraya�a, You have descended in Vrndavana to act as the child of 
Y asodamata, who sometimes used to tie You up with her ropes, and You 
are celebrated, therefore, by the name Damodara." 
That KH�a is the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Naraya�a, as 
accepted by the citizens of Dvaraka, was later on confirmed by the great 
Mayavadi philosophical leader, Sankaracarya. By accepting the Lord as 
impersonal, he did not reject the Lord's personal form. He meant that 
everything which has form in this material world is subjected to creation, 
maintenance and annihilation, but the Supreme Personality of Godhead, 
Naraya�a, does not have a material form subjected to these limitations. In 
order to convince the less intelligent class of men who take Kr��a to be an 
ordinary human being, Sankaracarya therefore said that God is impersonal. 
This impersonality means that He is not a person of this material condition. 
He is a transcendental personality without a material body. 
The citizens of Dvaraka addressed Lord Kr��a not only as Damodara, 
but also as Govinda, which indicates that Kr��a is very affectionate to the 
cows and calves; and just to refer to their intimate connection with 
Kr��a, they addressed Him as Y adunandana. He is the son of Vasudeva, 
born in the Y adu dynasty. In this way, the citizens of Dvaraka concluded 
that they were addressing Kr��a as the supreme master of the whole 
universe. They addressed Kr��a in many different ways, proud of being 
citizens of Dvaraka who could see Kr��a daily. 
When Satrajit was visiting the city of Dvaraka, the citizens felt great 
pride to think that although Kr��a was living in Dvaraka like an ordinary 
human being, the demigods were coming to see Him. Thus they informed 
Lord Kr��a that the sun-god, with his appealing bodily effulgence, was 
coming to see Him. The citizens of Dvaraka confirmed that the sun-god's 
coming into Dvaraka was not very wonderful, because people all over the 
universe who were searching after the Supreme Personality of Godhead 
knew that He had appeared in the family of the Y adu dynasty and was 
living in Dvaraka as one of the members of that family. Thus the citi­
zens expressed their joy on this occasion. On hearing the statement of 
His citizens, the all-pervasive Personality of Godhead, Kr��a, simply 
smiled. Being pleased with the citizens of Dvaraka, Kr��a informed them 
that the person whom they described as the sun-god was actually King 
Satrajit, who had come to visit Dvaraka City to show his opulence

in the form of the valuable jewel obtained from the sun-god. 
Satrajit, however, did not come to see Kr��a; he was instead over­
whelmed by the jewel of Syamantaka. He installed the jewel in a temple 
to be worshiped by briihmar-as he engaged for this purpose. This is an 
instance of a less intelligent person worshiping a material thing. In the 
Bhagavad-gitii it is stated that less intelligent persons, in order to get 
immediate results from their fruitive activities, worship the demigods who 
are created within this universe. The word "materialist" means one 
concerned with gratification of the senses within this material world. 
Although Kr��a later asked for this Syamantaka jewel, King Satrajit did 
not deliver it to Him, but he installed the jewel for his purposes of worship. 
And who would not worship that jewel? The Syamantaka jewel was so 
powerful that it was daily producing a large quantity of gold. A quantity 
of gold is counted by a measurement called a bhiira. According to Vedic 
formulas, one bhiira is equal to sixteen pounds of gold; one mound equals 
eighty-two pounds. The jewel was producing about 170 pounds of gold 
every day. Besides that, it is learned from Vedic literature that in whatever 
part of the world this jewel is worshiped there is no possibility of famine; 
not only that, but wherever the jewel is present, there is no possibility of 
anything inauspicious, such as pestilence or disease. 
Lord Kr��a wanted to teach the world that the best of everything 
should be offered to the ruling chief of the country. King Ugrasena was 
the overlord of many dynasties and happened to be the grandfather of 
Kr��a, and Kr��a asked Satrajit to present the Syamantaka jewel to Ki!J.g 
U grasena. Kr��a pleaded that the best should be offered to the king. Bht 
Satrajit, being a worshiper of the demigods, had become too materialistic 
and, instead of accepting the request of Kr��a, thought it wiser to worship 
the jewel in order to get the 170 pounds of gold every day. Materialistic 
persons who can achieve such huge quantities of gold every day are no� 
interested in Krwa consciousness. Sometimes, therefore, in order to show 
special favor, Kr��a takes away great accumulations of materialistic wealth 
from a person and thus makes him a great devotee. But Satrajit refused to 
abide by the order of Kr��a and did not deliver the jewel to him. 
After this incident, Satrajit's younger brother, in order to display the 
opulence of the family, took the jewel, put it on his neck and rode on 
horseback into the forest making a show of his material opulence. While 
the brother of Satrajit, who was known as Prasena, was moving here and 
there in the forest, a big lion attacked him, killing both him and the horse 
on which he was riding, and took away the jewel to his cave. The news was 
received by the gorilla king, Jambavan, who then killed that lion in the 
4 
Kr�!la, the Supreme Personality of Godhead 
cave and took away the jewel. Jambavan had been a great devotee of the 
Lord since the time of Lord Ramacandra, so he did not take the valuable 
jewel as something he very much needed. He gave it to his young son to 
play with as a toy. 
In the city, when Satrajit's younger brother Prasena did not return 
from the forest with the jewel, Satrajit became very upset. He did not 
know that his brother had been killed by a lion and that the lion had been 
killed by Jambavan. He was thinking instead that because Kr�!la wanted 
that jewel and it had not been delivered to Him, Kr�!la might have there­
fore taken the jewel away from Prasena by force and killed him. This idea 
grew into a rumor which was being spread by Satrajit in every part of 
Dvaraka. 
The false rumor that Kr�!la had killed Prasena and had taken away the 
jewel was spread everywhere like wildfire. Kr�!la did not like to be defamed 
in that way, and therefore He decided that He would go to the forest and 
find the Syamantaka jewel, taking with Him some of the inhabitants of 
Dvaraka. Along with important men ·of Dvaraka, Kr�!la went to search out 
Prasena, the brother of Satrajit, and He found him dead, killed by the lion. 
At the same time, Krwa also found the lion which had been killed by 
Jambavan, who is generally called by the name J.{k�a. It was found that the 
lion had been killed by the hand of J.{k�a without the assistance of any 
weapon. Kr�!la and the citizens of Dvaraka then found in the forest a 
great tunnel, said to be the path to J.{k�a's house. Kr�!la knew that the 
inhabitants of Dvaraka would be afraid to enter the tunnel; therefore He 
asked them to remain outside, and He Himself entered the dark tunnel 
alone to find J.{k�a, Jambavan. After entering the tunnel, Kr�!la saw that 
the . very valuable jewel known as Syamantaka had been given to the 
son of �k�a as a toy, and in order to take the jewel from the child, He 
went there and stood before him. When the nurse who was taking care of 
J.{k�a's child saw Kr�!la standing before her, she was <Jfraid, thinking the 
valuable Syamantaka jewel might be taken away by Him. She began to 
cry loudly out of feat. 
Hearing the nurse crying, Jambavan appeared on the scene in a very 
angry mood. Jambavan was actually a great devotee of Lord Kr�!la, but 
because he was in an angry mood he could not recognize his master; he 
thought Him to be an ordinary man. This brings to mind the statement of 
the Bhagavad-gitii in which the Lord advises Arjuna to get free from anger, 
greed and lust in order to rise up to the spiritual platform. Lust, anger and 
greed run parallel in the heart and check one's progress on the spiritual path. 
Not recognizing his master, Jambavan first challenged Him to fight. 
There was then a great fight between Kr�!la and Jambavan in which they 
The Story of the Syamantaka Jewel 
5 
fought like two opposing vultures. Whenever there is an eatable corpse the 
vultures fight heartily over the prey. Kr�J}a and Jambavan first of all began 
fighting with weapons, then with stones, then with big trees, then hand to 
hand, until at last they were hitting one another with their fists, and the 
blows were like the striking of thunderbolts. Each was expecting victory 
over the other, but the fighting continued for days, both in daytime and 
at night, without stopping. In this way the fighting continued for twenty­
eight days. 
Although Jambavan was the strongest living entity of that time, practi­
cally all the joints of his bodily limbs became slackened and his strength 
reduced to practically nil after being constantly struck by the fists of Sri 
Kr�J}a. Feeling very tired, with perspiration all over his bddy, Jamb a van 
was astonished. Who was this opponent who was weakening him? Jambavan 
was quite aware of his own superhuman bodily strength, but when he 
felt tired from being struck by Kr�)}a, he could understand that Krwa was 
no one else but his worshipable Lord, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. 
This incident has a special significance for the devotees. In the beginning, 
Jambavan could not understand Krsna because his vision was obscured 
.
.
. 
by material attachment. He was attached to his boy and to the greatly 
valuable Syamantaka jewel, which he did not want to spare for Kr�J}a. In 
fact, when Kr�J}a came there he became angry, thinking that He had come 
to take away the jewel. This is the material position; although one is very 
strong in body, that cannot help him understand Kr�J}a. 
In a sporting attitude, Kr�J}a wanted to engage in a mock fight with His 
devotee. As we have experienced from the pages of the Srimad-Bhiigavatam, 
the Supreme Personality of Godhead has all the propensities and instincts 
of a human being. Sometimes, in a sportive spirit, He wishes to fight to 
make a show of bodily strength, and when He so desires, He selects one of 
His suitable devotees to give Him that pleasure. Kr�J}a desired this pleasure 
of mock fighting with Jambavan. Although Jambavan was a devotee by 
nature, he was without knowledge of Krwa while giving service to the 
Lord by his bodily strength. But as soon as Kr�J}a was pleased by the 
fighting, Jambavan immediately understood that his opponent was none 
other than the Supreme Lord Himself. The conclusion is that he could 
understand Kr�!la by his service. Kr�J}a is sometimes satisfied by fighting 
also. 
Jambavan therefore said to the Lord, "My dear Lord, I can now under­
stand who You are. You are the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Lord 
Vi�)}U, the source of everyone's strength, wealth, reputation, beauty, 
wisdom and renunciation." This statement of Jambavan's is confirmed by 
the Vediinta-siitra, wherein the Supreme Lord is declared to be the source 
6 
Kr��a, the Supreme Personality of Godhead 
of everything. Jambavan identified Lord Kr��a as the Supreme Personality, 
Lord Vi��u: "My dear Lord, You are the creator of the creators of the 
universal affairs." This statement is very instructive to the ordinary man, 
who is amazed by the activities of a person with an exceptional brain. The 
ordinary man is surprised to see the inventions of a great scientist, but the 
statement of Jambavan confirms that although a scientist may be a creator 
of many wonderful things, Kr��a is the creator of the scientist. He is not 
only the creator of one scientist, but of millions and trillions, all over the 
universe. Jambavan said further, "You are not only creator of the creator, 
but You are also creator of the material elements which are manipulated . 
by the. so-called creators." Scientists utilize the physical elements or laws 
of material nature and do something wonderful, but actually such laws 
and elements are also the creation of Kr��a. This is actual scientific under­
standing. Less intelligent men do not try to understand who created the 
brain of the scientist; they are simply satisfied by seeing the wonderful 
creation or invention of the scientist. 
Jambavan continued: "My dear Lord, the time factor which combines 
all the physical elements is also Your representative. You are the supreme 
time factor in which all creation takes place, is maintained, and is finally 
annihilated. And not only the physical elements and the time factors but 
also the persons who manipulate the ingredients and advantages of creation 
are part and parcel of You. The living entity is not, therefore, an indepen­
dent creator. By studying all factors in the right perspective, one can see 
that You are the supreme controller and Lord of everything. My dear 
Lord, I can therefore understand that You are the same Supreme Per­
sonality of Godhead whom I worship as Lord Ramacandra. My Lord 
Ramacandra wanted to construct a bridge over the ocean, and I saw 
personally how the ocean became agitated simply by my Lord's glancing 
over it. And when the whole ocean became agitated, the living entities 
like the whales, alligators and timingila fish, all became perturbed. [The 
timingila fish in the ocean can swallow big aquatics like whales in one 
gulp.] In this way the ocean was forced to give way and allow Ramacandra 
to cross to. the island known as Lanka [now supposed to be Ceylon] . This 
construction of a bridge over the ocean from Cape Comorin to Ceylon is 
still well-known to everyone. After the construction of the bridge, a fire 
was set all over the kingdom of Rava�a. During the fighting with Rava�a, 
each and every part of Rava�a 's limbs was slashed and cut into pieces by 
Your sharp arrows, and his head fell to the face of the earth. Now I can 
understand that You are none other than my Lord Ramacandra. No one 
else has .such immeasurable strength; no one else could defeat me in this 
way." 
The Story of the Syamantaka Jewel 
7 
Lord Kr�tla became satisfied by the prayers and statements of Jambavan, 
and to mitigate the pains of his body, He began to smear the lotus palm of 
His hand all over the body of Jambavan. Jambavan at once felt relieved 
from the fatigue of the great fight. Lord Kr�tla then addressed him as King 
Jambavan, because he and not the lion was actually the king of the forest; 
with his naked hand, without a weapon, Jambavan had killed the lion. 
Kr�tla informed Jambavan that He had come to him to ask for the Syaman­
taka jewel because since the Syamantaka jewel had been stolen His name 
had been defamed by the less intelligent. Kr�tla plainly informed him that 
he had come there to ask him for the jewel in order to be free from this 
defamation. Jambavan understood the whole situation, and to satisfy the 
Lord he not only immediately delivered the Syamantaka jewel, but he also 
.brought his daughter Jambavati, who was of marriagable age, and presented 
her to Lord Kr�tla. 
The episode of Jambavati's marriage with Kr�tla and the delivery of the 
jewel known as Syamantaka was finished within the mountain cave. Al­
though the fighting between Krwa and Jambavan went on for twenty -eight 
days, the inhabitants of Dvaraka waited outside the tunnel for twelve 
days, and after that they decided that something undesirable must have 
happened. They could not understand what had actually happened for 
certain, and being very sorry and tired, they had returned to the city of 
Dvaraka. 
All the members of the family, namely the mother of Kr�tla, Devaki, His 
father Vasudeva, and His chief wife Rukmitli, along with all other friends, 
relatives and residents of the palace, became very sorry when the citizens 
returned home without Krsna. Because of their natural affection for Krsna, 
. 
. 
. 
. 
.
.
 
they began to call Satrajit ill names, for he was the cause of Kr�tla's disap-
pearance. They went to worship the goddess Candrabhaga, praying for the 
return of Kr�pa. The goddess was satisfied by the prayers of the citizens of 
Dvaraka, and she immediately offered them her benediction. Simulta­
neously, Kr�tla appeared on the scene accompanied by His new wife 
Jambavati, and all the inhabitants of Dvaraka and relatives of Kr�tla 
became joyful. The inhabitants of Dvaraka became as joyful as someone 
receiving a dear relative back from the dead. The inhabitants of Dvaraka 
had concluded that Kr�tla had been put into great difficulties due to the 
fighting; therefore, they had become almost hopeless of His return. But 
when they saw that Kr�pa had actually returned, not al�ne but with a 
new wife, Jambavati, they immediately performed another celebration 
ceremony. 
King U grasena then called for a meeting of all important kings and 
chiefs. He also invited Satrajit, and Kr�pa explained before the whole

wanted to return the valuable jewel to King Satrajit. Satrajit, however, 
became ashamed because he had unnecessarily defamed Kr�pa. He accepted 
the jewel in his hand, but he remained silent, bending his head downwards, 
and without speaking anything in the assembly of the kings and chiefs, he 
returned home with the jewel. Then he thought about how he could clear 
himself from the abominable action he had performed by defaming Kr��a. 
He was conscious that he had offended Kr��a very grievously and that he 
had to find a remedial measure so that Kr��a would again be pleased with 
him. 
King Satrajit was eager to get relief from the anxiety he had foolishly 
created due to being attracted by a material thing, specifically the Syaman­
taka jewel. Satrajit was truly afflicted by the offense he had committed 
toward Kr�pa, and he sincerely wanted to rectify it. From within, Kr�p.a 
gave him good intelligence, and Satrajit decided to hand over to Kr�p.a 
both the jewel and his beautiful daughter, Satyabhama. There was no 
alternative for mitigating the situation, and therefore he arranged the 
marriage ceremony of Kr�pa and his beautiful daughter. He gave in charity 
both the jewel and his daughter to the Supreme Personality of Godhead. 
Satyabhama was so beautiful and qualified that Satrajit, in spite of being 
asked for the hand of Satyabhama by many princes, was waiting to find a 
suitable son-in-law. By the grace of Kr�pa he decided to hand his daughter 
over to Him. 
Lord Kr�pa, being pleased upon Satrajit, informed him that He did not 
have any need of the Syamantaka jewel. "It is better to let it remain in the 
temple as you have kept it," He said, "and every one of us will derive 
benefit from the jewel. Because of the jewel's presence in the city of 
Dvaraka, there will be no more famine or disturbances created by pesti­
lence or excessive heat and cold." 
Thus ends the Bhaktivedanta purport of the Second 
Volume, First 
Chapter, of K!§"t;ta, "The Story of the Syamantaka Jewel." 
2 I The Killing of Satrajit and Satadhanva 
After Akrura visited Hastinapura and reported the condition of the 
Pa��avas to Kr��a, there were further developments. The Pa��avas were 
transferred to a house which was made of shellac and was later on set 
ablaze, and everyone understood that the Pa��avas along with their 
mother, Kunti, had been killed. This information was also sent to Lord 
Kr��a and Balarama. After. consulting together, They decided to go to 
Hastinapura to show sympathy to Their relatives. Kr��a and Balarama 
certainly knew that the Pa��avas could not have been killed ih the 
devastating fire, but in spite of this knowledge They wanted to go to 
Hastinapura to take part in the bereavement. On arriving in Hastinapura, 
Kr��a and Balarama first of all went to see Bhi�madeva, because he was the 
chief of the Kuru dynasty. They then saw Vidura, Gandhari and Dro�a. 
Other members of the Kuru dynasty were not sorry, because they wanted 
the Pa��avas and their mother to be killed. But some family members, 
headed by Bhi�ma, were actuall;y very sorry for the incident, and Kr��a 
and Balarama expressed equal sorrow, without disclosing the actual situa­
tion.· 
When Kr��a and Balarama were away from the city of Dvaraka, there 
was a conspiracy to take away the Syamantaka jewel from Satrajit. The 
chief conspirator was Satadhanva. Along with others, Satadhanva wanted 
to marry Satyabhama, the beautiful daughter of Satrajit. Satrajit had 
promised that he would give his beautiful daughter in charity to various 
candidates, but later on the decision was changed, and Satyabhama was 
given to Krwa along with the 'Syamantaka jeweL Satrajit had no desire to 
give the jewel away along with his daughter, and Kr��a, knowing his 
mentality, accepted his daughter but returned the jeweL After getting 
back the jewel from Kr��a, he was satisfied and kept it with him always. 
But in the absence of Krwa and Balarama there was a conspiracy by many 
9 
�
10 
Kr��a, the Supreme Personality of Godhead 
men, including even Akrura and Krtavarma, who were devotees of Lord 
Kr��a, to take the jewel from Satrajit. Akrura and Krtavarma joined the 
conspiracy because they wanted the jewel for Krwa. They knew that 
Kr�!la wanted the jewel and that Satrajit had not delivered it properly. 
Others joined the conspiracy because they were disappointed in nothaving 
the hand of Satyabhama. Some of them incited Satadhanva to kill Satrajit 
and take away the jewel. 
The question is generally raised, Why did a great devotee like Akrura 
join this conspiracy? And why did Krtavarma, although a devotee of the 
Lord, join the conspiracy also? The answer is given by great authorities like 
Jiva Gosvami and others that although Akrura was a great devotee, he was 
cursed by the inhabitants of V rndavana because of his taking Kr�!la away 
from their midst. Because of his wounding their feelings, Akrura was 
forced to join the conspiracy declared by sinful men. Similarly, Krtavarma 
was a devotee, but because of his intimate association with Kamsa, he was 
also contaminated by sinful reaction, and he also joined the conspiracy. 
Being inspired by all the members of the conspiracy, Satadhanva one 
night entered the house of Satrajit and killed him while he was sleeping. 
Satadhanva was a sinful man of abominable character, and although due 
to his sinful activities he was not to live for many days, he decided to kill 
Satrajit while Satrajit was sleeping at home. When he entered the house to 
kill Satrajit, all the women there began to cry very loudly, but in spite of 
their great protests, Satadhanva mercilessly butchered Satrajit without 
hesitation, exactly as a butcher kills an animal in the slaughterhouse. 
Since Kr��a was absent from home, His wife Satyabhama was also present 
on the night Satrajit was murdered, and she began to cry, "My dear father! 
My dear father! How mercilessly you have been killed!" The dead body of 
Satrajit was not immediately removed for cremation because Satyabhama 
wanted to go to Kr��a in Hastinapura. Therefore the body was preserved 
in a tank of oil so that Kr�!la could come back and see the dead body of 
Satrajit and take real action against Satadhanva. Satyabhama immediately 
started for Hastinapura to inform Kr��a about the ghastly death of her 
father. 
When Kr��a was informed by Satyabhama of the murder of His father­
in-law, He began to lament like an ordinary man. His great sorrow is, again, 
a strange thing. Lord Kr�!la has nothing to do with action and reaction, but 
because he was playing the part of a human being He expressed His full 
sympathy for the bereavement of 
Satyabhama, and His eyes filled 
with tears upon hearing about the death of His father-in-law. He thus began 
to lament, "Oh, what unhappy incidents have taken place!" In this way 
The Killing of Satrajit and Satadhanva 
II 
both Kr�!la and Balarama, along with Satyabhama, the wife of Kr�!la, 
immediately returned to Dvaraka and began to make plans to kill 
Satadhanva and take away the jewel. Although he was a great outlaw in 
the city� Satadhanva was still very much afraid of Kr�!la 's power, and thus 
he bec'ime most afraid on Kr�!la's arrival. 
Understanding Kr�!la's plan to kill him, he immediately went to take 
shelter of Krtavarma. But on being approached by him, Krtavarma said, 
"I shall never be able to offend Lord KH!la and .Balarama because They 
are not ordinary persons. They are the Supreme Personality of Godhead. 
Who can be saved from death if he has offended Balarama and Kr�!la? No 
one can be saved from Their wrath." Krtavarma further said that Kamsa, 
although powerful and assisted by many demons, could not be saved from 
the wrath of Kr�!la, and what to speak of J arasandha, who had been 
defeated by Kr�!la eighteen times and each time had to return from the 
fighting in disappointment. 
When Satadhanva was refused help by Krtavarma he went to Akriira 
and implored him to help. Akriira also replied, "Both Balarama and Kr�!la 
are Themselves the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and anyone who 
knows Their unlimited strength would never dare to offend Them or fight 
with Them." He further informed Satadhanva, "Kr�!la and Balarama are so 
powerful that simply by willing They are creating the whole cosmic 
manifestation, maintaining it and dissolving it. Unfortunately, persons who 
are bewildered by the illusory energy cannot understand the strength of 
Kr�!la, although the whole cosmic manifestation is fully under His control." 
He cited, as an example, that Kr�!la, even at the age of seven years, had 
lifted Govardhana Hill and had continued to hold up the mountain for 
seven days, exactly as a child carries a small umbrella. Akriira plainly 
informed Satadhanva that he would always offer his most respectful 
obeisances to Krwa, the Supersoul of everything that is created and the 
original cause of all causes. When Akriira also refused to give him shelter, 
Satadhanva decided to deliver to the hands of Akriira the Syamantaka 
jewel. Then, riding on a horse which could run at great spe�d and up to 
four hundred miles at a stretch, he fled the city. 
When Kr�!la and Balarama were informed of the flight of Satadhanva, 
They mounted Their chariot, its flag marked by the picture of Garu�a, 
and followed immediately. Kr�!la was particularly angry with Satadhanva 
and wanted to kill him because he had killed Satrajit, a superior person­
ality. Satrajit happened to be the father-in-law of Kr�!la, and it is the 
injunction of the siistras that anyone who has rebelled against a superior 
person, or gurudruha, must be punished in proportion to the volume of 
12 
Kr��a, the Supreme Personality of Godhead 
offense. Because Satadhanva had killed His father-in-law, Kr��a was deter­
mined to kill him by any means. 
Satadhanva's horse became exhausted and died near a garden house in 
Mithila. Unable to take help of the horse, Satadhanva began to run with 
great speed. In order to be fair to Satadhanva, Kr��a and Balarama also 
left Their chariot and began to follow Satadhanva on foot. While both 
Satadhanva and Kr��a were running on foot, Kr��a took His disk and 
cut off the head of Satadhanva. After Satadhanva was killed, Kr��a 
searched through his clothing for the Syamantaka jewel, but He could not 
find it. He then returned to Balarama and said, "We have killed this 
person uselessly because the jewel is not to be found on his body." Sri 
Balarama suggested, "The jewel might have been kept in custody of 
another man in Dvaraka, so You'd better return and search it out." Sri 
Balarama expressed His desire to remain in Mithila City for some days 
because He enjoyed an intimate friendship with the king. Therefore, Kr��a 
returned to Dvaraka, and Balarama entered the city of Mithila. 
When the King of Mithila saw the arrival of Sri Balarama in his city, he 
became most pleased and received the Lord with great honor and hospi­
tality. He presented many valuable presents to Balaramaji in order to seek 
His pleasure. At this time Sri Balarama lived in the city for several years as 
the honored guest of the King of Mithila, Janaka Maharaja. During this 
time, Duryodhana, the eldest son of Dhrtara�tra, took the opportunity o� 
coming to Balarama and learning from Him the art of fighting with a club. 
After killing Satadhanva, Kr��a returned to Dvaraka, and in order to 
please His wife Satyabhama, He informed her of the death of Satadhanva, 
the killer of her father. But He also informed her that the jewel had not 
been found in his possession. Then, according to religious principles, 
Kr��a, along with Satyabhama, performed all kinds of ceremonies in honor 
of the death of His father-in-law. In that ceremony all the friends and 
relatives of the family joined together. 
Akriira and Krtavarma, who were prominent members in the conspiracy 
to kill Satrajit, had incited Satadhanva to kill him, but when they heard 
of the death of Satadhanva at Kr��a's hand, and when they heard also that 
Kr��a had returned to Dvaraka, they both immediately left Dvaraka. The 
citizens of Dvaraka felt themselves threatened with pestilence and natural 
disturbances due to the absence of Akriira from .the city. This was a kind 
of superstition because while Lord Kr��a was present there could not be 
any pestilence, famine or natural disturbances. But in the absenc� of Akriira 
there were some disturbances in Dvaraka. Once in the province of Kasi 
within the barricade of Vara�asi there was severe drought and practically 
The Killing of Satrajit and Satadhanva 
13 
no rainfall. At that time the King of Kasi arranged the marriage of his 
daughter, known as Gandini, with Svaphalka, the father of Akriira. This 
was done by the King of Kasi on the advice of an astrologer, and actually 
it so happened that after the marriage of the King's daughter with 
Svaphalka there was sufficient rainfall in the province. Due to this super­
natural power of Svaphalka, his son Akriira was also considered equally 
powerful, and people were under the impression that wherever Akriira or 
his father remained; there would be no natural disturbance, famine or 
drought. That kingdom is considered to be happy where there is no famine, 
pestilence, or excessive heat and cold and where people are happy mentally, 
spiritually and bodily. As soon as there is some disturbance, people con­
sider the cause to be due to the absence of an auspicious personality in the 
city. Thus there was a rumor that because of the absence of Akriira 
inauspicious things were happening. After the departure of Akriira, some 
of the elderly members of the town began to perceive that there were also 
inauspicious signs due to the absence of the Syamantaka jewel. When Lord 
Sri Kr�!la heard these rumors spread by the people He decided to summon 
Akriira from the kingdom of Kasi. Akriira was Kr�!la's uncle; therefore, 
when he came back to Dvaraka Lord Kr�!la first of all welcomed him as 
befitting a superior person. Kr�!la is the Supersoul in everyone's heart; He 
knows everything going on in everyone's heart. He knew everything that 
had happened in connection with Akriira's conspiracy with Satadhanva. 
Therefore, He smilingly began to address Akriira. 
Addressing him as the chief among magnificent men, Kr�!la said, "My 
dear uncle, it is already known to Me that the Syamantaka jewel was left 
by Satadhanva with you. Presently there is no direct claimant of the 
Syamantaka jewel, for King Satrajit has no male issue. His daughter 
Satyabhama is not very anxious for this jewel, yet her expected son, as 
grandson of Satrajit, would, after performing the regulative principles of 
inheritance, be the legal claimant of the jewel." Lord Kr�!la indicated by 
this statement that Satyabhama was already pregnant and that her son 
would be the real claimant for the jewel and would certainly take the jewel 
from him. 
Kr�!la continued, "This jewel is so powerful that no ordinary man is 
able to keep it. I know that you are very pious in activities, so there is no 
objection to the jewel being kept with you. There is one difficulty, and 
that is that My elder brother, Sri Balarama, does not believe My version 
that the jewel is with you. I therefore request you, 0 large-hearted one, to 
show Me the jewel before My other relatives so that they may be pacified. 
You cannot deny that the jewel is with you because from various kinds of 
-1 
�·· 
14 
Kr��a, the Supreme Personality of Godhead 
rumors we can understand that you have enhanced your opulence and are 
performing sacrifices on an altar made of solid gold." The properties of 
the jewel were known: wherever the jewel remained, it would produce for 
the keeper almost nine mounds of pure gold daily. Akriira was getting gold 
in that proportion and was distributing it very profusely at sacrificial 
performances. Lord Kr�pa cited Akriira's lavishly spending in gold as 
positive evidence of his possessing the Syamantaka jewel. 
When Lord KHpa, in friendly terms and in sweet language, impressed 
Akriira about the real fact and Akriira understood that nothing could be 
concealed from the knowledge of Sri Kr�pa, he brought the valuable jewel, 
shining like the sun and covered by cloth, and presented it before Kr�pa. 
Lord Kr�pa took the Syamantaka jewel in His hand and showed it to all 
His relatives and friends present there and then again returned the jewel to 
Akriira in their presence so that they would know that the jewel was 
actually being kept by Akriira in Dvaraka City. 
This story of the Syamantaka jewel is very significant. In the Srimad­
Bhagavatam it is said that anyone who hears the story of the Syamantaka 
jewel or describes it or simply remembers it will be free from all kinds of 
defamation and the reactions of all impious activities and thus will attain 
the highest perfectional condition of peace. 
Thus ends the Bhaktivedanta purport of the Second Volume, Second 
Chapter of Kr�pa, "The Killing of Satriijit and Satadhanvii." 
3 I Five Queens Married by Kr�!la 
There was a great rumor that the five Pa�9ava brothers, along with their 
mother Kunti, had, under the plan of Dhrtara�tra, died in a fire accident 
in the house of shellac in which they were living. But then the five brothers 
were detected at the marriage ceremony of Draupadi; so again another 
rumor spread that the Pa�9avas and their mother were not dead._ it 
was a rumor, but actually it was so; they returned to their capital city, 
Hastinapura, and people saw them face to face. When this news was carried 
to Kr��a and Balarama, Kr��a wanted to see them personally, and therefore 
Kr��a decided to go to Hastinapura. 
This time, Kr��a visited Hastinapura in state, as a royal prince, accom­
panied by His commander-in-chief, Yuyudhana, and by many other 
soldiers. He had not actually been invited to visit the city, yet He went to 
see the Pa�9avas out of His affection for His great devotees. He visited the 
Pa�9avas without warning, and all of them got up from their respective 
seats as soon as they saw Him. Kr��a is called Mukunda because as soon as 
one comes in constant touch with Krsna or sees Him in full Krsna 
. . . 
. .. 
consciousness, one immediately becomes freed from all material anxietie?. 
Not only that, but he immediately becomes blessed with all spiritual bliss. 
On receiving Kr��a, the Pa�9avas became very enlivened, just as if 
awakened from unconsciousness or from loss of life. When a man is lying 
unconscious, his senses and the different parts of his body are not active, 
but when he regains his consciousness, the senses immediately become 
active. Similarly, the Pa!i9avas received Kr�!la as if they had just regained 
their consciousness, and so they became very much enlivened. Lord Krwa 
embraced every one of them, and by the touch of the Supreme Personality 
of Godhead, the Pa�9avas immediately became freed from all reactions of 
material contamination, and therefore they were smiling in spiritual bliss. 
By seeing the face of Lord Kr��a, everyone was transcendentally satisfied. 
15 
16 
Kr�pa, the Supreme Personality of Godhead 
Lord Kr�pa, although the Supreme Personality of Godhead, was playing 
the part of an ordinary human being, and thus He immediately touched 
the feet of Yudhi�thira and Bhima because they were His two older cousins. 
Arjuna embraced Kr�pa as a friend of the same age, whereas the two 
younger brothers, namely N akula and Sahadeva, touched the lotus feet of 
Krwa to show Him respect. After an exchange of greetings according to 
the social etiquette befitting the position of the Pa!!-9avas and Lord KH!ia, 
Kr�!la was offered an exalted seat. When He was comfortably seated, the 
newly married Draupadi, young and very beautiful in her natural feminine 
gracefulness, came before Lord Kr�!la to offer her respectful greetings. The 
Yadavas who accompanied Krwa to Hastinapura were also very respect­
fully received; specifically, Satyaki, or Yuyudhana, was also offered a nice 
seat. In this way, when everyone else was properly seated, the five brothers 
took their seats nearby Lord Kr�!la. 
After meeting with the five brothers, Lord KH!ia personally went to 
visit Srimati Kuntidevi, the mother of the Pa!!-9avas, who was also the 
paternal aunt of Kr�!la. In offering His respects to His aunt, Kr�!la also 
touched her feet. Kuntidevi's eyes became wet, and, in great love, she 
feelingly embraced Lord Kr�!la. She then inquired from Him about the 
well-being of her paternal family members-her brother Vasudeva, his 
wife, and other members of the family. Similarly, Kr�!la also inquired 
from His aunt about the welfare of the Pa!!-9ava families. Although Kunti­
devi was related to Kr�!la by family ties, she knew immediately after 
meeting Him that He was the Supreme Personality of Godhead. She remem­
bered the past calamities of her life and how by the grace of Kr�!la the 
Pa!!-9avas and their mother had been saved. She knew perfectly well that 
no one, without Krwa 's grace, could have saved them from the fire 
accident designed by Dhrtara�tra and his sons. In a choked up voice, she 
began to narrate before Kr�!la the past history of their life. 
Srimati Kunti said: "My dear Kr�!la, I remember the day when You sent 
my brother Akrura to gather information about us. This means that You 
always remember us automatically. When You sent Akrura, I could under­
stand that there was no possibility of our being put into danger. All good 
fortune in our life began when You sent Akrura to us. Since then, I have 
been convinced that we are not without protection. We may be put into 
various types of dangerous conditions by our family members, the Kurus, 
but I am confident that You remember us and that You always keep us safe 
and sound. Devotees who simply think of You are always immune from all 
kinds of material dangers, and what to speak of ourselves, who are 
personally remembered by You. So, my dear Krwa, there is no question 
Five Queens Married by Kr��a 
17 
of bad luck; we are always in an auspicious position because of Your grace. 
But because You have bestowed a special favor on us, people should not 
mistakenly think that You are partial to some and inattentive to others. 
You make no such distinction. No one is Your favorite and no one is Your 
enemy. As the Supreme Personality of Godhead, You are equal to every­
one, and everyone can take advantage of Your special protection. The fact 
is that although You are equal to everyone, You are especially inclined to 
the devotees who always think of You. The devotees are related to You by 
ties of love. As such, they cannot forget You even for a moment. You are 
present in everyone's heart, but because the devotees always remember 
You, You also respond accordingly. Although the mother has affection for 
all the children, she takes special care of the one who is fully dependent. I 
know certainly, my dear Krwa, that being seated in everyone's heart, You 
always create auspicious situations for Your unalloyed devotees." 
Then King Yudhi�thira also praised Kr�!la as the Supreme Personality 
and universal friend of everyone, but because Kr��a was taking special 
care of the Pa�9avas, King Yudhi�thira said: "My dear Kr��a, we do not 
know what sort of pious activities we have executed in our past lives that 
have made You so kind and graceful to us. We know very well that the 
great mystic:S who are always engaged in meditation to capture You do not 
find it easy to obtain such grace, nor can they draw any personal attention 
from You. I cannot understand why You are so kind upon us. We are not 
yogis, but, on the contrary, we are attached to material contaminations. 
We are householders dealing in politics, worldly affairs. I do not know why 
You are so kind upon us." 
Being requested by King Yudhi�thira, Kr��a agreed to stay in Hastina­
pura for four months during the rainy season. The four months of the 
rainy season are called Ciiturmiisya. During this period, the generally 
itinerant preachers and briihmar-as stop at a certain place and live under 
rigid regulative principles. Although Lord Kr��a is above all regulative 
principles, He agreed to stay at Hastinapura out of affection for the 
Pap.9avas. Taking this opportunity of Kr��a's residence in Hastinapura, 
all the citizens of the town got the privilege of seeing Him now and then, 
and thus they merged into transcendental bliss simply by seeing Lord 
Kr�p.a eye to eye. 
One day while Kr�p.a was staying with the Pap.9avas, He and Arjuna 
prepared themselves to go to the forest to hunt. Both of them sat down on 
the chariot, which flew a flag with a picture of Hanuman. Arjuna's special 
chariot is always marked with the picture of Hanuman, and therefore his 
name is also Kapidhvaja. (Kapi means Hanuman, and dhvaja means "flag.") 
18 
Kr��a, the Supreme Personality of Godhead 
Thus Arjuna went to the forest with his bow and infallible arrows. He 
dressed himself with suitable protective garments, for he was to practice 
killing many enemies. He specifically entered that part of the forest where 
there were many tigers, deer and various other animals. Kr��a did not go 
with Arjuna to practice animal killing because He doesn't have to practice 
anything; He is self-sufficient. He accompanied Arjuna to see how he was 
practicing because in the future he would have to kill many enemies. After 
entering the forest, Arjuna killed many tigers, boars, bisons, gavayas (a 
kind of wild animal), rhinoceroses, deer, hares, porcupines and similar 
other animals, which he pierced with his arrows. Some of the dead animals, 
which were fit to be offered in the sacrifices, were carried by the servants 
and sent to King Yudhi�thira. Other ferocious animals, such as tigers and 
rhinoceroses, were killed only to stop disturbances in the forest. Since 
there are many sages and saintly persons who are residents of the forests, 
it is the duty of the k§atriya kings to keep even the forest in a peaceful 
condition for living. 
Arjuna felt tired and thirsty from hunting, and therefore he went to the 
bank of the Yam una along with Kf�l)a. When both the Kr��as, namely 
Kr�!la and Arjuna (Arjuna is sometimes called Kr�!la, as is Draupadi), 
reached the bank of the Yam una, they washed their hands and feet and 
mouths and drank the clear water of the Yam una. While they were resting 
and drinking water, they saw a beautiful girl of marriagable age walking 
alone on the bank of the Yamuna. Kf�l)a asked His friend Arjuna to go 
forward and ask the girl who she was. By the order of Kr�!!a, Arjuna 
immediately approached the girl, who was very beautiful. She had an 
attractive body and nice glittering teeth and smiling face. Arjuna inquired, 
"My dear girl, you are so beautiful with your raised breasts-may I ask you 
who you are? We are surprised to see you loitering here alone. What is your 
purpose in coming here? We can guess only that you are searching after a 
suitable husband. If you don't mind, you can disclose your purpose. I 
shall try to satisfy you." 
The beautiful girl was the river Yam una personified. She replied, "Sir, I 
am _the daughter of the sun-god, and I am now performing penance and 
austerity to have Lord V i��u as my husband. I think He is the Supreme 
Person and just suitable to become my husband. I disclose my desire thus 
because you wanted to know it." 
The girl continued, "My dear sir, I know you are the hero Arjima; 
so I may further say that I'll not accept anyone as my husband besides 
Lord Vi��u, because He is the only protector of all living entities and the 
bestower of liberation for all conditioned souls. I shall be thankful unto 
Five Queens Married by Kr��a 
19 
you if you pray to Lord V��u to become pleased With me." The girl 
Yam una knew it well that Arjuna was a great devotee of Lord Kr��a and 
that if he would pray, Kr��a would never deny his request. To approach 
Kr��a directly may sometimes be futile, but to approach Kr��a through 
His devotee is sure to be successful. She further told Arjuna, "My name is 
Kalindi, and I live within the water of the Yamuna. My father was kind 
enough to construct a special house for me within the waters of the 
Yam una, and I have vowed to remain in the water as long as I cannot find 
Lord Kr��a. "-The message of the girl Kalindi was duly carried to Kr��a by 
Arjuna although Kr��a, as the Supersoul of everyone's heart, knew every­
thing. Without further discussion, Kr��a immediately accepted Kalindi and 
asked her to sit down on the chariot. Then all of them approached King 
Yudhi�thira. 
After this, Kr��a was asked by King Yudhi�thira to help in constructing 
a suitable house to be planned by the great architect Visvakarma, the 
celestial engineer in the heavenly kingdom. Kr��a immediately called for 
Visvakarma, and He made him construct a wonderful city according to 
the desire of King Yudhi�thira. When this city was constructed, Maharaja 
Yudhi�thira requested Kr��a to live with them a few days more in order to 
give them the pleasure of His association. Lord Kr��a accepted the request 
of Maharaja Yudhi�thira and remained there for many days more. 
In the meantime, Kr��a engaged in the pastime of offering Kha��ava 
Forest, which belonged to King Indra. Kr��a wanted to give it to Agni, the 
fire-god. Kha��ava Forest contained many varieties of drugs, and Agni 
required to eat them for rejuvenation. Agni, however, did not touch 
Kha��ava Forest directly, but requested Kr��a to help him. Agni knew 
that Kr��a was very much pleased with him because he had formerly given 
Him the Sudarsana disc. So in order to satisfy Agni, KH�a became the 
chariot driver of Arjuna, and both went to the Kha��ava Forest. After 
Agni had eaten up the Kha��ava Forest, he was very much pleased. This 
time, he offered a specific bow known as Ga��iva, four white horses, one 
chariot, and an invincible quiver with two specific arrows considered to be 
talismans, which had so much power that no warrior could counteract 
them. When the Kha��ava Forest was being devoured by the fire-god, 
Agni, there was a demon of the name Maya who was saved by Arjuna from 
the devastating fire. For this reason, that former demon became a great 
friend of Arjuna, and in order to please Arjuna he constructed a nice 
assembly house within the city constructed by Visvakarma. This assembly 
house had some corners so puzzling that when Duryodhana came to visit 
this house he was misdirected, accepting water as land and land as water. 
20 
Kf�J)a, the Supreme Personality of Godhead 
Duryodhana thus became insulted by the opulence of the PaJ)�avas, and 
he became their determined enemy. 
After a few days, Kr�J)a took permission from King Yudhi�thira to 
return to Dvaraka. When he got permission, he went to his country, accom­
panied by Satyaki, the leader of the Y adus who were living in Hastinapura 
with Him. Kalindi also returned with Kr�J)a to Dvaraka. After returning, 
Kr�!la consulted many learned astrologers to find the suitable moment at 
which to marry Kalindi, and then He married her with great pomp. This 
marriage ceremony gave much pleasure to the relatives of both parties, 
and all of them enjoyed the great, occasion. 
The kings of Avantipura (now known as Ujjain) were named Vinda and 
Anuvinda. Both kings were under the control of Duryodhana. They had 
one sister named Mitravinda, who was a very qualified, learned and elegant 
girl. She was the daughter of one of Kr�!!a's aunts. She was to select her 
husband in the assembly of princes, but she strongly desired to have Krwa 
as her husband. During the assembly for selecting her husband, however, 
Kr�!la was present, and He forcibly carried away Mitravinda in the presence 
of all other royal princes. Being unable to resist Kf�J)a, the princes were 
left simply looking at each other. 
After this incident, Krwa married the daughter of the King of Kosala. 
The King of Kosala Province was called N agnajit. He was very pious and 
was a follower of the Vedic ritualistic ceremonies. His most beautiful 
daughter was named Satya. Sometimes Satya was called Nagnajiti, for she 
was the daughter of King Nagnajit. King Nagnajit wanted to give the hand 
of his daughter to any prince who could defeat seven very strong, stalwart 
bulls maintained by him. No one in the princely order could defeat the 
seven bulls, and therefore no one could claim the hand of Satya. The seven 
bulls were very strong, and they could hardly bear even the smell of any 
prince. Many princes approached this kingdom and tried to subdue these 
bulls, but instead of controlling them, they themselves were defeated. This 
news was spread all over the country, and when Krwa heard that the girl 
Satya could be achieved only by defeating the seven bulls, He prepared 
Himself to go to the kingdom of Kosala. With many soldiers, He ap­
proached that part of the country, known as Ayodhya, making a regular 
state visit. 
When it was known to the King of Kosala that Kr�!la had come to ask 
the harid of his daughter, he became very pleased. With great respect and 
pomp, he welcomed Kr�!la to the kingdom. When Kr�!la approached him, 
he offered Him a suitable sitting place and articles for reception. Everything 
appeared to be very elegant. Kr�!la also offered him respectful obeisances, 
thinking him to be His future father-in-law. 
Five Queens Married by Kr��a 
21 
When Satya, the daughter of King N agnajit, understood that Kr�tta 
Himself had come to marry her, she was very much pleased that the husband 
of the goddess of fortune had so kindly come there to accept her. She had 
cherished the idea of marrying Kr�tta for a long time and was following the 
principles of austerities in order to obtain her desired husband. She then 
began to think, "If I have performed any pious activities to the best of my 
capacity and if I have sincerely thought all along to have Kr�tta as my hus­
band, then Kr�tta may be pleased to fulfill my long-cherished desire." She 
began to offer prayers to Kr�tta mentally, thinking, "I do not know how the 
Supreme Personality of Godhead can be pleased upon me. He is the master 
and Lord of everyone. Even the goddess of fortune, whose place is next to 
the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and Lord Siva, Lord Brahma and 
many other demigods of different planets always offer their respectful 
obeisances unto the Lord. The Lord also sometimes descends on this earth 
in different incarnations in order to fulfill the desire of His devotees. He is 
so exalted and great that I do not know how to satisfy Him." She thought 
that the Supreme Personality of Godhead could be pleased only out of His 
own causeless mercy upon the devotee; otherwise, there was no other 
means to please Him. Lord Caitanya, in the same way, prayed in His 
Sik�ii�taka verses, "My Lord, I am Your eternal servant. Somehow or other 
I have fallen into this material existence. If You kindly pick me up and fix 
me as an atom of dust at Your lotus feet, it will be a great favor to Your 
eternal servant." The Lord can be pleased only by a humble attitude in the 
service spirit. The more we render service unto the Lord under the direc­
tion of the spiritual master, the more we make advancement on the path 
of approaching the Lord. We cannot demand any grace or mercy from the 
Lord because of our service rendered to Him. He may accept or not accept 
our service, but the only means to satisfy the Lord is through the service 
attitude, and nothing else. 
King N agnijit was already a pious king, and having Kr��a in his palace, 
he began to worship Him to the best of his knowledge and capacity. He 
presented himself before the Lord thus: "My dear Lord, You are the pro­
prietor of the whole cosmic manifestation, and You are Naraya�a, the rest 
of all living creatures. You are self-sufficient and pleased with Your per­
sonal opulences, so how can I offer You anything? And how could I please 
You by such offering? It is not possible, because I am an insignificant living 
being. Actually I have no capacity to render any service unto You." 
Kr�tta is the Supersoul of all living creatures, so He could understand the 
mind of Satya, the daughter of King N agnajit. He was also very much 
pleased with the respectful worship of the King in offering Him a sitting 
place, eatables, residence, etc. He was appreciative, therefore, that both the 
22 
Kr�!la, the Supreme Personality of Godhead 
girl and the father of the girl were anxious to have Him as their intimate 
relative. He began to smile and in a great voice said, "My dear King 
N agnajit, you know very well that anyone in , the princely order who is 
regular in his position will never ask anything from anyone, however 
exalted he may be. Such requests by a k§atriya king- from another person 
have been deliberately forbidden by the learned Vedic followers. If a 
k§atriya breaks this regulation, his action is condemned by learned scho­
lars. But in spite of this rigid regulative principle, I am asking you for the 
hand of your beautiful daughter just to establish our relationship in return 
for your great reception of Me. You may also be pleased to be informed 
that in our family tradition there is no scope for our offering anything in 
exchange for accepting your daughter. We cannot pay any price which you 
may impose for delivering her." In other words, Kr�pa wanted the hand of 
Satya from the King without fulfilling the condition of defeating the seven 
bulls. 
After hearing the statement of Lord Kr�pa, King Nagnajit said, "My 
dear Lord, You are the reservoir of all pleasure, all opulences and all qua­
lities. The goddess of fortune, Lak�mijl, always lives on Your chest. Under 
these circumstances, who can be a better husband for my daughter? Both 
myself and my daughter have always prayed for this opportunity. You are 
the chief of the Yadu dynasty. You may kindly know that from the very 
beginning I have made a vow to marry my daughter to a suitable candidate, 
one who can come out victorious in the test I have devised. I have imposed 
this test just to understand the prowess and position of my intended son­
in-law. You are Lord Kr�pa, andY ou are the chief of all heroes. I am sure 
You shall be able to bring these seven bulls under control without any 
difficulty. Until now they have never been subdued by any prince; anyone 
who has attempted to bring them under control has simply had his limbs 
broken." 
King Nagnajit continued his request: "Kr�pa, if You'll kindly bridle the 
seven bulls and bring them under control, then undoubtedly You will be 
selected as the desired husband of my daughter, Satya." After hearing 
this statement, Krwa could understand that the King did not want to 
break his vow. Thus, in order to fulfill his desire, He tightened His belt 
and prepared to fight with the bulls. He immediately divided Himself 
into seven Kr�!las, and each one of Them immediately caught hold of 
a bull and bridled its nose, thus bringing it under control as if it were 
a plaything. 
Kr�!la's dividing Himself into seven is very significant. It was known to 
Satya, the daughter of King N agnajit, that Kr�!la had already married many 
Five Queens Married by Kr��a 
23 
other wives, and still she was attached to Kr��a. In order to encourage her, 
He immediately expanded Himself into seven. The purport is that Krwa is 
one, but He has unlimited forms of expansions. He married many hundreds 
of thousands of wives, but this does not mean that while He was with one 
wife the others were bereft of His association. Kr��a could associate with 
each and every wife by His expansions. 
When Krwa brought the bulls under His control by bridling their noses, 
their strength and pride were immediately smashed. The name and fame 
which the bulls had attained was thus vanquished. When the bulls had been 
bridled by Kr��a, He pulled them strongly, just as a child pulls a toy 
wooden bull. Upon seeing this advantage of Krwa, King N agnajit became 
very much astonished and immediately, with great pleasure, brought his 
daughter Satya before Kr��a and handed her over to Him. Kr��a also 
immediately accepted Satya as His wife. Then there was a marriage cere­
mony with great pomp. The queens of King N agnajit also were very much 
pleased because their daughter Satya got Kr��a as her husband. Since the 
King and queens were very pleased on this auspicious occasion, there was a 
celebration all over the city in honor of the marriage. Everywhere was 
heard the sounds of the conchshell and kettledrum and various other 
vibrations of music and song. The learned briihmar;ws began to shower their 
blessings upon the newly married couple. In jubilation, all the inhabitants 
of the city dressed themselves with colorful garments and ornaments. King 
N agnajit was so pleased that he began to give a dowry to the daughter and 
son-in-law, as follows. 
First of all he gave them ten thousand cows and three thousand well­
dressed young maidservants, ornamented up to their necks. This system of 
dowry is still current in India especially for the k§atriya princes. Also, 
when a k§atriya prince is married, at least a dozen maidservants of similar 
age are given along with the bride. After giving the cows and maidservants, 
the King also enriched the dowry by giving 9,000 elephants and a hundred 
times more chariots than elephants. This means that he gave 900,000 
chariots. And he gave a hundred times more horses than chariots, or 
90,000,000 horses, and a hundred times more slaves than horses. Such 
slaves and maidservants were maintained by the royal princes with all pro­
visions, as if they were their own children or family members. After giving 
this dowry as described, the King of the Kosala Province bade his daughter 
and great son-in-law be seated on a chariot. He allowed them to go to 
their home, guarded by a division of well-equipped soldiers. When they 
were travelling fast to their new home, his heart became enlivened with 
affection for them. 
24 
Kr��a, the Supreme Personality of Godhead 
Before this marriage of Satya with Kr��a, there had been many com­
petitive engagements with the bulls of King Nagnajit, and many other 
princes of the Y adu dynasty and of other dynasties as well had tried to win 
the hand of Satya. When the frustrated princes of the other dynasties heard 
that Kr�!la was successful in getting the hand of Satya by subduing the 
bulls, naturally they became envious. While Kr�!la was travelling to Dvaraka, 
all the frustrated and defeated princes encircled Him and began to 
shower their arrows on the bridal party. When they attacked Kr�!la's party 
and threw arrows like incessant torrents of rain, Arjuna, the best friend of 
Kr�!la, took charge of the challenge, and he alone drove them off very 
easily to please his great friend Kr�!la on the occasion of His marriage. He 
immediately took up his bow of the name Ga!l�iva and chased away all the 
princes; exactly as a lion drives away all other small animals simply by 
chasing them, Arjuna drove away all the princes without killing even one 
of them. After this, the chief of the Y adu dynasty, Lord Kr�!la, along with 
His newly married wife and a huge dowry, entered the city of Dvaraka 
with great pomp. Krwa then lived there with His wife very peacefully. 
Kr�!la had another aunt, His father's sister, whose name was Srutakirti, 
and who was married and lived in the Kekaya province. She had a daughter 
whose name was Bhadra. Bhadra also wanted to marry Kr�!la, and her 
brother handed her· over to Him unconditionally. Kr�!la also accepted her 
as His bona fide wife. Thereafter, Kr�!la married a daughter of the king of 
the Madras Province, and her name was Lak�ma�a. Lak�ma!la had all good 
qualities. She was also forcibly married by Kr�!la, who took her in the 
same way that Garu�a snatched the jar of nectar from the hands of the 
demons. Kr�!la kidnapped this girl in the presence of many other princes in 
the assembly of her svayarhvara. Svayarhvara is a ceremony in which the 
bride can select her own husband from an assembly of many princes. 
The description of Kr�!la's marriage with the five girls mentioned in this 
chapter is not sufficient. He had many other thousands of wives besides 
them. The other thousands of wives were accepted by Kr�!la after killing one 
demon named Bhaumasura. All these thousands of girls were held captive 
in the palace of Bhaumasura, and Kr�!la released them and married them. 
Thus ends the Bhaktivedanta purport of the Second Volume, Third 
Chapier of Kr�!la, "Five Queens Married by Knew."
4 I Deliverance of the Demon Bhaumasura 
The story of Bhaumasura-how he kidnapped and made captive 16,000
princesses by collecting them from the palaces of various kings and how he 
was killed by Kr�pa, the Supreme Lord of wonderful character-is all 
described by Sukadeva Gosvami to King Parik�it in the Srimad-Bhiigavatam. 
Generally, the demons are always against the demigods. This demon, 
Bhaumasura, having become very powerful, took by force the umbrella 
from the throne of the demigod V arupa. He also took the earrings of Aditi, 
the mother of the demigods. He conquered a portion of heavenly Mount 
Meru and occupied the portion which was known as Mapiparvata. The 
King of the heavenly planets, Indra, therefore came to Dvaraka to com­
plain about Bhaumasura before Lord Krwa. 
Hearing this complaint by Indra, the King of heaven, Lord Kr�pa, ac­
companied by His wife Satyabhama, immediately started for the abode of 
Bhaumasura. Both of them rode on the back of Garuda, who flew them to 
. 
. 
Pragjyoti�apura, the capital city of Bhaumasura. It was not a very easy task 
to enter into the city of Pragjyoti�apura, because it was very well fortified. 
First of all, there were four formidab!e forts guarding the four directions 
of the city, and it was well-protected on all sides by formidable military 
strength. The next boundary was a water canal all around the city, and in 
addition the whole city was surrounded with electric wires. The next 
fortification was of anila, a gaseous substance. After this, there was a net­
work of barbed wiring constructed by a demon of the name Mura. It 
appeared that the city was well-protected even in terms of today's scientific 
advancements. 
When Kr�pa arrived, He broke all the forts to pieces by the strokes of 
His club, and the military strength scattered here and there by the constant 
onslaught of the arrows of Kr�pa. With His celebrated Sudarsana-cakra 
He counteracted the electrified boundary; the channels of water and the 
25 
26 
Kr��a, the Supreme Personality of Godhead 
gaseous boundary were made null and void, and He cut to pieces the 
electrified network fabricated by the demon Mura. By the vibration of His 
conchshell, He not only broke the hearts of great fighters, but also the 
fighting machines which were there. Similarly, the walls around the city 
were broken by His invincible club. 
The vibration of His conchshell sounded like the thunderbolt at the time 
of the dissolution of the whole cosmic situation. The demon Mura heard 
the vibration of the conchshell, awakened from his sleep, and personally 
came out to see what had happened. He had five heads and had long been 
living within the water. The Mura demon was as brilliant as the sun at the 
time of the dissolution of the cosmic manifestation, and his temper was like 
blazing fire. The effulgence of his body was so dazzling that it was difficult 
to see him with open eyes. When he came out, he first of all took out his 
trident and began to rush the Supreme Personality of Godhead. The 
onslaught of the demon Mura was like a big snake attacking Garu�a. His 
angry mood was very severe, and he appeared ready to devour the three 
worlds. First of all he attacked the carrier of Kr�ga, Garu�a, by whirling 
his trident and he began to vibrate sounds through his five faces like the 
roaring of a lion. The roaring produced by the vibration of his mouths 
spread all over the atmosphere until it extended not only all over the 
world, but also into outer space, up and down and out to the ten direc­
tions. In this way, the sound was rumbling throughout the whole universe. 
Lord Kf�ga saw that the trident of the Mura demon was gradually 
rushing toward His carrier, Garu�a. Immediately, by a trick of His hand, 
He took two arrows ,and threw them toward the trident, cutting it to 
pieces. Simultaneously, using many arrows, He pierced the mouths of the 
demon Mura. When he saw himself outmaneuvered by the Supreme 
Personality of Godhead, the Mura demon immediately began to strike 
Him in great anger with his club. But Lord Kr�ga, with His own club, 
broke the club of Mura to pieces before it could reach Him. The demon, 
bereft of his weapon, decided to attack Kr�ga with his strong arms, but by 
the aid of His Sudarsana-cakra, Kr�ga immediately separated the demon's 
five heads from his body. The demon then fell into the water, just as the 
peak of a mountain falls into the ocean after being struck by the thunder­
bolt of lndra. 
This demon Mura had seven sons, named Tamra, Antarik�a, Sravaga, 
Vibhavasu, Vasu, Nabhasvan and Aruga. All of them became puffed up 
and vengeful because of the death of their father, and in order to retaliate, 
they prepared in great anger to fight with Kr�ga. They equipped themselves 
with necessary weapons and situated Pitha, another demon, to act as 
Deliverance of the Demon Bhaumasura 
27 
commander in the battle. By the order of Bhaumasura, all of them com­
binedly attacked Kr��a. 
When they came before Lord Kr��a, they began to shower Him with 
many kinds of weapons, like swords, clubs, lances, arrows and tridents. But 
they did not know that the strength of the Supreme Personality of 
Godhead is unlimited and invincible. Kr��a, with His arrows, cut all the 
weapons of the men of Bhaumasura into pieces, like grains. K:r��a 
then threw His weapons, and Bhaumasura's commander-in-chief, Pilha, 
along with his assistants, fell down, their military dress cut off and their 
heads, legs, arms and thighs severed. All of them were sent to the 
superintendent of death, Y amaraja. 
Bhaumasura was also known as N arakasura, for he happened to -be the 
son of the earth personified. When he saw that all his soldiers, commanders 
and fighters were killed on the battlefield by the strokes of the weapons of 
the Personality of Godhead, he became exceedingly angry at the Lord. He 
then came out of the city with a great number of elephants who had all 
been born and brought up on the seashore. All of them were highly intoxi­
cated. When they came out, they saw that Lord Kr��a and His wife were 
beautifully situated high in outer space just like a blackish cloud about the 
sun, glittering with the light of electricity. The demon Bhaumasura im­
mediately released a weapon called Sataghni, by which he could kill 
hundreds of warriors with one stroke, and simultaneously all his assistants 
also threw their respective weapons at the Supreme Personality of God­
head. Lord Kr��a began to counteract all these weapons by releasing His 
feathered arrows. The result of this fight was that all the soldiers and 
commanders of Bhaumasura fell to the ground, their arms, legs and heads 
separated from their trunks, and all their horses and elephants also fell 
with them. In this way, all the weapons released by Bhaumasura were cut 
to pieces by the reaction of the Lord's arrows. 
The Lord was fighting on the back of Garu�a, and Garu�a was also 
helping the Lord by striking the horses and the elephants with his wings 
and scratching their heads with his nails and sharpened beak. The elephants 
were feeling much pain by Garu�a's attack pn them, and they were all 
dispersing from the battlefield. Bhaumasura alone remained on the battle­
field, and he engaged himself in fighting with Kr��a. He saw that Kr��a's 
carrier, Garu�a, was causing great disturbance to his soldiers and elephants, 
and in great anger he struck Garu�a with all his strength, which defied the 
strength of the thunderbolt. Fortunately, Garu�a was not an ordinary bird, 
and he felt the strokes given by Bhaumasura just as a great elephant feels 
the impact of a garland of flowers. 
28 
Kr�pa, the Supreme Personality of Godhead 
Bhaumasura thus came to see that none of his tricks would act upon 
Kr�pa, and he became aware that all his attempts to kill Kr�pa would be 
frustrated. Yet he attempted for the last time, taking a trident in his hand 
to strike Him. Kf�I}-a was so dexterous that before Bhaumasura could touch 
his trident, his head was cut off by the sharp Sudarsana-cakra. His head, 
illuminated by earrings and helmets, fell down on the battlefield. On the 
occasion of Bhaumasura's being killed by Lord Kr�pa, all the demon's 
relatives began to scream in disappointment, and the saintly persons began 
to glorify the chivalrous activities of the Lord. Taking this opportunity, 
the denizens of the heavenly planets began to shower flowers on the Lord. 
At this time, the earth personified appeared before Lord Kr�pa and 
greeted Him with a garland of vaijayanti jewels. She also returned the 
dazzling earrings of Aditi, bedecked with jewels and gold. She also returned 
the umbrella of V arupa, along with another valuable jewel, which she 
presented to Kr�pa. After this, . the earth personified began to offer her 
prayers to Kf�pa, the Supreme Personality and master of the world, who is 
always worshiped by very exalted demigods. She fell down in obeisances 
and, in great devotional ecstasy, began to speak. 
"Let me offer my respectful obeisances unto the Lord, who is always 
present with four kinds of symbols, namely His conchshell, disc, lotus and 
club, and who is the Lord of all demigods. Please accept my respectful 
obeisances unto You. My dear Lord, You are the Supersoul, and in order 
to satisfy the aspiration of Your devotees, You descend on the earth in 
Your various transcendental incarnations, which are just appropriate to the 
devotees' worshipful desire. Kindly accept my respectful obeisances. 
"My dear Lord, the lotus flower is grown out of Your navel, and You 
are always decorated with a garland of lotus flowers. Your eyes are always 
spread like the petals of the lotus flower, and therefore they are all-pleasing 
to the eyes of others. Your lotus feet are so soft and delicate that they are 
always worshiped by Your unalloyed devotees, and they pacify their 
lotus-like hearts. I therefore repeatedly offer my respectful obeisances 
unto You. 
"You possess all kinds of religions, fame, property, knowledge and 
renunciation; You are the shelter of all five opulences. Although You are 
all-pervading, You have nevertheless appeared as the son of Vasudeva. 
Please, therefore, accept my respectful obeisances. You are the original 
Supreme Personality of Godhead and the supreme cause of all causes. 
Only Your Lordship is the reservoir of all knowledge. Let me offer my 
respectful obeisances unto You. Personally You are unborn; still, You are 
the father of the whole cosmic manifestation. You are the reservoir and 
Deliverance of the Demon Bhaumasura 
29 
shelter of all kinds of energies. The manifestive appearance of this world is 
caused by You, and You are both the cause and effect of this cosmic 
manifestation. Please therefore accept my respectful obeisances. 
"My dear Lord, as for the three gods-Brahma, Vi�pu and Siva-they are 
also not independent of You. When there is necessity of creating this 
cosmic manifestation, You create Your passionate appearance of Brahma, 
and when You want to maintain this cosmic manifestation, You expand 
Yourself as Lord Vi�pu, the reservoir of all goodness. Similarly, You appear 
as Lord Siva, master of the modes of ignorance, and thus dissolve the 
whole creation. Your transcendental position is always maintained, in 
spite of creating these three modes of material nature. You are never 
entangled like the ordinary living entities with these modes of material 
nature. 
"Actually, my Lord, You are the material nature, You are the father of 
the universe, and You are the eternal time that has caused the combination 
of nature and the material creator. Still, You are always transcendental to 
all these material activities. My dear Lord, 0 Supreme Personality of 
Godhead, I know that earth, water, fire,. air, sky, the five sense objects, 
mind, the senses and their deities, egotism, as well as the total material 
energy-everything animate and inanimate in this phenomenal world is 
resting upon You. Since everything is produced of You, nothing can be 
separated from You. Yet, since You are transcendentally situated, neither 
can anything material be identified with Your personality. Everything is, 
therefore, simultaneously one and different from You, and the philoso­
phers who try to separate everything from you are certainly mistaken in 
their viewpoint. 
"My dear Lord, may I inform You that this boy, whose name is 
Bhagadatta, is the son of my son, Bhaumasura. He has been very much 
affected by the ghastly situation created by the death of his father and 
has become very much confused, being afraid of the present situation. 
I have therefore brought him to surrender unto Your lotus feet. I request 
Your Lordship to give shelter to this boy and bless him with Your lotus 
feet. I am bringing him to You so that he may become relieved from the 
reactions of all the sinful activities of his father." 
When Lord Kr�pa heard the prayers of mother Earth, He immediately 
assured her of immunity from all fearful situations. He said to Bhagadatta, 
"Don't be afraid." Then He entered the palace of Bhaumasura, which was 
equipped with all kinds of opulences. In the palace of Bhaumasura Lord 
Kr�pa saw 
16,100 young princesses, who had been kidnapped and 
held captive there. When the princesses saw the Supreme Personality of 
30 
Kf�l).a, the Supreme Personality of Godhead 
Godhead, Kr��ta, enter the palace, they immediately became captivated by 
the beauty of the Lord and prayed for His causeless mercy. Within their 
minds, they decided to accept Lord Kr�l).a as their husband without any 
hesitation. Each one of them began to pray to providence that Kr�p.a might 
become her husband. Sincerely and seriously, they offered their hearts to 
the lotus feet of Kr�p.a with an unalloyed devotional attitude. As the 
Supersoul in everyone's heart, Kr�p.a could understand their uncontami­
nated desire, and He agreed to accept them as His wives. Thus, He arranged 
for suitable dresses and ornaments for them, and each of them, seated on 
a palanquin, was dispatched to Dvaraka City. Kr�p.a also collected unlimited 
wealth from the palace, along with chariots, horses, jewels and treasure. 
He took from the palace fifty white elephants, each with four tusks, and 
all of them were dispatched to Dvaraka. 
After this incident, Lord Kr�p.a and Satyabhama entered Amaravati, the 
capital city of the heavenly planet, and they immediately entered the 
palace of King Indra and his wife, Sacidevi, who welcomed them. Kr�p.a 
then presented Indra with the earrings of Aditi. 
When Kr�p.a and Satyabhama were returning from the capital city of 
Indra, Satyabhama remembered Kr�l).a's promise to give her the plant of 
the piirijiita flower. Taking the opportunity of having come to the heavenly 
kingdom, she plucked a piirijiita plant and kept it on the back of Garu�a. 
Once Narada 'took a piirijiita flower and presented it to Kr�p.a's senior Wife, 
Sri Rukmip.idevi. On account of this, Satyabhama developed an inferiority 
complex; she also wanted a flower from Kr�p.a. Kr�p.a could understand 
the competitive womanly nature of His co-wives, and He smiled. He 
immediately asked Satyabhama, "Why are you asking for only one flower? 
I would like to give you a whole tree of piirijiita flowers." 
Actually, Kr�p.a had purposely taken His wife Satyabhama with Him so 
she could collect the piirijiita with her own hand. But the denizens of the 
heavenly planet, including Indra, became very irritated. Without their 
permission, Satyabhama had plucked a piirijiita plant, which is not to be 
found on the earth planet. Indra, along with other demigods, offered 
opposition to Kr�l).a and Satyabhama for taking away the plant, but in 
order to please His favorite wife Satyabhama, Kr�p.a became determined 
and adamant, so there was a fight between the demigods and Kr�J).a. As, 
usual, Kr�p.a came out victorious, and He triumphantly brought the 
piirijiita plant chosen by His wife to this earth planet, to Dvaraka. After 
this, the plant was installed in the palace garden of Satyabhama. On 
account of this extraordinary tree, the garden house of Satyabhama became 
extraordinarily beautiful. As the piirijiita plant came down to the earthly 
·Deliverance of the Demon Bhaumasura
31 
planet, the fragrance of the flower also came down, and the celestial 
swans also migrated to this earth in search of its fragrance and honey. 
King lndra's behavior toward Kr��a was not very much appreciated 
by great sages like Sukadeva Gosvami. Out of His causeless mercy, Kr��a 
had gone to the heavenly kingdom, Amaravati, to present King lndra with 
his mother's earrings, which had been lost to Bhaumasura, and lndra had 
been very glad to receive them. But when a flower plant from the heavenly 
kingdom was taken by Kr�pa, Indra offered to fight with Him. This was 
self-interest on the part of lndra. He offered his prayer, tipping down his 
head to the lotus feet of Kr�pa, but as soon as his purpose was served, he 
became a different creature. That is the way of the dealings of materialistic 
men. Materialistic men are always interested in their own profit. For this 
purpose they can offer any kind of respect to anyone, but when their 
personal interest is over, they are no longer friends. This selfish nature is 
not only found among the richer class of men on this planet, but is present 
even in personalities like lndra and other demigods. Too much wealth 
makes a man selfish. A selfish man is not prepared to take to Kr�pa 
consciousness and is condemned by great devotees like Sukadeva Gosvami. 
In other words, possession of too many worldly riches is a disqualification 
for advancemert in Kr�pa consciousness. 
After defeating lndra, Kr�pa arranged to marry the 16,100 girls brought 
from the custody of Bhaumasura. By expanding Himself in 16,100 forms, 
He simultaneously married them all in· different palaces in one auspicious 
moment. He thus established the truth that Kr�pa and no one else is the 
Supreme Personality of Godhead. There is nothing impossible, for Kr�pa 
is the Supreme Personality of Godhead; He is all-powerful, omnipresent 
and imperishable, and as such there is nothing wonderful in this pastime. 
All the palaces of the more than 16,000 queens of Kr�pa were full with 
suitable gardens, furniture and other paraphernalia, of which there is no 
parallel in this world. There is no exaggeration in this story from Srimad­
Bhiigavatam. The queens of Kr�pa were all expansions of the goddess of 
fortune, Lak�miji. Kr�pa used to live with them in different palaces, and 
He treated them in exactly the same way as an ordinary man treats his 
wife. 
We should always remember that the Supreme Personality of Godhead 
Kr�pa was playing exactly like a human being; although He showed His 
extraordinary opulences by simultaneously marrying more than 16,000 
wives in more than 16,000 palaces, He behaved with them just like an 
ordinary man, and He strictly followed the relationship between husband 
and wife required in ordinary homes. Therefore, it is very difficult to 
32 
Kr��a, the Supreme Personality of Godhead 
understand the characteristics of the Supreme Brahman, the Personality of 
Godhead. Even demigods like Brahma and others are unable to probe into 
the transcendental pastimes of the Lord. The wives of Kr��a were so 
fortunate that they got the Supreme Personality of Godhead as their 
husband, although their husband's personality was unknown even to the 
demigods like Brahma. 
In their dealings as husband and wife, Kr�r;ta and His queens would 
smile, talk, joke, embrace, and so on, and their conjugal relationship ever 
increasingly developed. In this way, both Kr��a and the queens enjoyed 
transcendental happiness in their household life. Although each and every 
queen had thousands of maidservants engaged for her service, the queens 
were all personally attentive in serving Kr��a. Each one of them used to 
receive Kr��a personally when He entered the palace. They engaged in 
getting Him seated on a nice couch, presenting Him with all kinds of 
worshipable paraphernalia, washing His lotus feet with Ganges water, 
offering Him betel nuts and massaging His legs. In this way, they were 
giving Him relief from the fatigue of being away from home. They saw to 
fanning Him nicely, offering Him fragrant essential floral oil, decorating 
Him with flower garlands, dressing His hair, asking Him to lie down to 
take rest, bathing Him personally and feeding Him nice palatable dishes. 
All these things were done by each queen herself. They did not wait for the 
maidservants. In other words, Krwa and His different queens displayed 
on this earth an ideal household life. 
Thus ends the Bhaktivedanta purport of the Second Volume, Fourth 
Chapter, of Kr�r;ta, "The Deliverance of the Demon Bhaumiisura." 
5 I Talks Between Krsna a11d Rukmini

Once upon a time, Lord Kr�!la the Supreme Personality of Godhead, the 
bestower of all knowledge to all living entities from Brahma to the 
insignificant ant, was sitting in the bedroom of Rukmi!li, who was 
engaged in the service of the Lord along with her assistant maidservants. 
Kr�!la was sitting on the bedstead of Rukmi!li, and the maidservants were 
engaged in fanning Him with ciimaras (yak-tail fly-whisks). 
Lord Krwa's dealings with Rukmi!li as a perfect husband is a perfect 
manifestation of the supreme perfection of the Personality of Godhead. 
There are many philosophers who propound a concept of the Absolute 
Truth in which God cannot do this or that. They deny the incarna�on of 
God, or the Supreme Absolute Truth in human form. But actually, the 
fact is different: God cannot be subjected to our imperfect sensual 
activities. He is the all-powerful, omnipresent Personality of Godhead, and 
by His supreme will, He can not only create, maintain and annihilate the 
whole cosmic manifestation, but He can also descend as an ordinary human 
being in order to execute the highest mission. As stated in the Bhagavad­
gitii, whenever there are discrepancies in the discharge of human occupa­
tional duties, He descends. He is not forced to appear by any external 
agency, but descends by His own internal potency in order to reestablish 
the standard functions of human activities as well as to simultaneously 
annihilate the disturbing elements in the progressive march of human 
civilization. In accordance with this principle of the transcendental pastimes 
of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, He descended in His eternal form 
of Sri Kr�!la in the dynasty of the Y adus. 
The palace of Rukmi!li was wonderfully finished. There were many 
canopies hanging on the ceiling with laces bedecked with pearl garlands, 
and the whole palace was illuminated by the effulgence of valuable jewels. 
There were many flower orchards of baela and ciimeli, which are con-
33 
34 
Kr��a, the Supreme Personality of Godhead 
considered to be the most fragrant flowers in India. There were many clus­
ters of these plants, with blooming flowers enhancing the beauty of the 
palace. And because of the exquisite fragrance of the flowers, little groups 
of humming bees were gathered around the trees, and at night the pleasing 
moonshine glittered through the network of holes in the windows. There 
were many heavily flowered trees of piirijiita, and the mild wind stirred 
the flavor of the flowers all around. Within the walls of the palace, there 
was incense burmng, and the fragrant smoke was leaking out of the 
window shutters. Within the room there were mattresses covered with 
white bedsheets resembling the foam of milk; the bedding was as soft and 
white as milk foam. In this situation, Lord Sri Kr�pa was very comfortably 
sitting and enjoying the service of Rukmipi'ji assisted by her maidservants. 
Rukmipi' was also very eager to get the opportunity of serving the 
Supreme Personality of Godhead as her husband. She therefore wanted 
to serve the Lord personally and took the handle of the ciimara from the 
hand of the maidservant and began to move the fan. The handle of the 
ciimara was made of gold, decorated and bedecked with valuable jewels, 
and it became more beautiful when it was taken by Rukmipi', because all 
of her fingers were beautifully set with jeweled rings. Her legs were 
decorated with ankle bells and jewels, which rang very softly between the 
pleats of her sari. Rukmipi''s raised breasts were smeared with kunkuma
and saffron; thus her beauty was enhanced by the reflection of the reddish 
color emanating from her covered breasts. The highly raised lower part of 
her buttocks was decorated with a jeweled lace girdle, and a locket of 
great effulgence hung on her neck. Above all, because she was engaged in 
the service of Lord Kr�pa-although at that time she was old enough to 
have grown-up sons-her beautiful body was beyond compare in the three 
worlds. When we take account of her beautiful face, it appears that the 
curling hair on her head, the beautiful earrings on her ears, her smiling 
mouth, and her necklace of gold, all combined to shower rains of nectar; 
and it was definitely proved that Rukmipi' was none other than the original 
goddess of fortune who is always engaged in the service of the lotus feet 
of Nadiyapa. 
The pastimes of Kr�pa and Rukmipi' in Dvaraka are accepted by great 
authorities as manifestations of those of Narayapa and Lak�mi', which are 
of an exalted opulence. The pastimes of Radha and Kr�pa in V rndavana 
are simple and rural, distinguished from the polished urban characteristics 
of those of Dvaraka. The characteristics of Rukmipi' were unusually bright� 
and Kr�pa was. very much satisfied with her behavior. 
Kr�pa had experienced that when Rukmipi' was offered a piirijiita flower 
Talks Between Kr��a and Rukmi�i 
35 
by Narada Muni, Satyabhama had become envious of her co-wife and had 
immediately demanded a similar flower from Kr��a. In fact, she could not 
be pacified until she was promised the whole tree. That was actually done 
by Kr��a; the tree was brought down to the earth planet from the heavenly 
kingdom. After this episode, Kr��a expected that because Satyabhama had 
been rewarded by a full tree of piirijiita, Rukmi�i would also demand 
something. Rukmi�i did not mention anything of the incident, however, 
for she was grave and simply satisfied in her service. Kr��a wanted to see 
her a bit irritated, and therefore He schemed in order to see the beautiful 
face of Rukmi�i in an irritated condition. Although Kr��a had more than 
16,100 wives, He used to behave with each of them with familial affection; 
He would create a particular situation between Himself and His wife in 
which the wife would criticize Him in the irritation of love, and Krwa 
would enjoy this. In this case, because Kr��a could not find any fault with 
Rukmi�i, for she was very great and always engaged in His service, He 
smilingly, in great love, began to speak to her. Rukmi�i was the daughter 
of King Bhi�maka, a powerful king. Thus Kr��a did not address her as 
Rukmi�i; He addressed her this time as the princess. "My dear princess, it 
is very surprising. Many great personalities in the royal order wanted to 
marry you. Although not all of them were kings, all possessed the opulence 
and riches of the kingly order; they were well-behaved, learned, famous 
among kings, ·beautiful in their bodily features and personal qualifications, 
liberal, very powerful in strength, and advanced in every respect. They were 
not unfit in any way, and over and above that, your father and your 
brother had no objection to such marriages. On the contrary, they gave 
their word of honor that you would be married with Sisupala; the marriage 
was sanctioned by your parents. Sisupala was a great king and was so lusty 
and mad after your beauty that if he had married you, I think he would 
always have remained with you just like your faithful servant. 
"In comparison to Sisupala, with his personal qualities, I am nothing. 
And you may personally realize it. I am surprised that you rejected the 
marriage with Sisupala and accepted Me, who am inferior in comparison to 
Sisupala. I think myself completely unfit to be your husband because you 
are so beautiful, sober, grave and exalted. May I inquire from you the 
reason that induced you to accept Me? Now, of course, I can address you 
as My beautiful wife, but still I may inform you of My actual position-that 
I am inferior to all those princes who wanted to marry you. 
"First of all, you may know that I was so much afraid of Jarasandha that 
I could not dare to live on the land, and thus I have constructed this house 
within the water of the sea. It is not my business to disclose this secret to 
36 
Kr�!ia, the Supreme Personality of Godhead 
others, but you must know that I am not very heroic; I am a coward and 
am afraid of them. Still I am not safe, because all the great kings of the 
land are inimical to Me. I have personally created this inimical feeling by 
fighting with them in many ways. Another fault is' that although I am on 
the throne of Dvaraka, I have no immediate claim. Although I got a 
kingdom by killing My maternal uncle, Kamsa, the kingdom was to go to 
My grandfather; so actually I have no possession of a kingdom. Besides 
that, I have no fixed aim in life. People cannot understand Me very well. 
What is the ultimate goal of My life? They know very well that I was a 
cowherd boy in V rndavana. People expected that I would follow the 
footsteps of My foster father, Nanda Maharaja, and be faithful to Srimati 
Radhara!li and all Her friends in the village of V rndavana. But all of a 
sudden I left them. I wanted to become a famous prince. Still I could not 
have any kingdom, nor could I rule as a prince. People are bewildered about 
My ultimate goal of life; they do not know whether I am a cowherd boy or 
a prince, whether I am the son of N anda Maharaja or the son of Vasudeva. 
Because I have no fixed aim in life, people may call Me a vagabond. There­
fore, I am surprised that you could select such a vagabond husband. 
"Besides this, I am not very much polished, even in social etiquette. A 
person should be satisfied with one wife, but you see I have married many 
times, and I have more than 16,000 wives. I cannot please all of them as a 
polished husband. My behavior with them is not very nice, and I know you 
are very much conscious of it. I sometimes create a situation with My wives 
which is not very happy. Because I was trained in a village in My childhood, 
I am not well acquainted with the etiquette of urban life. I do not know 
the way to please a wife with nice words and behavior. And from practical 
experience it is found that any woman who follows My way or who 
becomes attracted by Me is ultimately left to cry for the rest of her life. In 
V rndavana, many go pis were attracted to Me, and now I have left them, 
and they are living but are simply crying for Me in separation. I have 
heard from Akriira and U ddhava that since I left V rndavana, all my 
cowherd hoy friends, the gopis and Radhara!li, and My foster father 
Nanda Maharaja are simply crying constantly for Me. I have left Vrndavana 
for good and am now engaged with the queens in Dvaraka, but I am not 
well-behaved with any of you. So you can very easily understand that I 
have no steadiness of character; I am not a very reliable husband. The net 
result of being attracted to Me is to acquire a life of bereavement only. 
"My dear beautiful princess, you may also know that I am always 
penniless. Just after My birth, I was carried penniless to the house of 
Nanda Maharaja, and I was raised just like a cowherd boy. Although My 
Talks Between Kr�J)a and RukmiJ)i 
37 
foster father possessed many hundreds of thousands of cows, I was not 
proprietor of even one of them. I was simply entrusted to take care of 
them and tender them, but I was not the proprietor. Here also, I am not 
proprietor of anything, but am always penniless. There is no cause to 
lament for such a penniless condition; I possessed nothing in the past, so 
why should I lament that I do not possess anything at present? You may 
note also that My devotees are not very opulent persons; they also are very 
poor in worldly goods. Those who are very rich, possessing worldly wealth, 
are not interested in devotion to Me or Kr�J)a consciousness. On the 
contrary, when a person becomes penniless, whether by force or by 
circumstances, he may become interested in Me if he gets the proper 
opportunity. Persons who are proud of their riches, even if they are offered 
association with My devotees, do not take advantage of consciousness of 
Me. In other words, the poorer class of men may have some interest in Me, 
but the richer class of men have no interest. I think, therefore, that your 
selection of Me was not very intelligent. You appear to be very intelligent, 
trained by your father and brother, but ultimately you have made a great 
mistake in seleCting your life's companion. 
"But there is no harm; it is better late than never. You are at liberty to 
select a suitable husband who is actually an equal to you in opulence, 
family tradition, wealth, beauty, education-in all respects. Whatever mis­
takes you may have made may be forgotten. Now you may chalk out your 
own lucrative path of life. Usually a person does not establish a marital 
relationship with a person who is either higher or lower than his position. 
My dear daughter of the King of Vidarbha, I think you did not consider 
very sagaciously before your marriage. Thus you made a wrong selection 
by choosing Me as your husband. You mistakenly heard about My having 
very exalted character, although factually I was nothing more than a 
beggar. Without seeing Me and My actual position, simply by hearing about 
Me, you selected Me as your husband. That was not very rightly done. 
Therefore I advise you that it is better late than never; you can now select 
one of the great k§atriya princes and accept him as your life's companion, 
and you can reject Me." 
Kr��a was proposing that Rukmi�i divorce Him at a time when Rukmi�i 
already had many grown-up children. Therefore Kr��a's whole proposition 
to Rukmi�i appeared to be something unexpected, because according to 
Vedic culture there was no such thing as separation of husband and wife by 
divorce. Nor was it possible for Rukmi�i to do so in advanced age, when 
she had many married sons. Each and every one of Kr��a's proposals 
appeared to Rukmi�i to be crazy, and she was surprised that Kr��a could 
38 
Kr�!la, the Supreme Personality of Godhead 
say such things. Simple as she was, her anxiety was increasing more and 
more at the thought of separation from Kr��a. 
Kr�p.a continued: "After all, you have to prepare yourself for your next 
life. I therefore advise that you select someone who can help you both in 
this life and the next life, for I am completely unable to help. My dear 
beautiful princess, you know that all the members of the princely order, 
including Sisupala, Salva, Jarasandha, Dantavakra and even your elder 
brother Rukmi, are all My enemies; they do not like Me at all. They hate 
Me from the core of their hearts. All these princes were very much puffed 
up with their worldly possessions, and they did not care a fig for anyone 
·who came· before them. In order to teach them some lessons, I agreed to 
kidnap you according to your desire; otherwise I actually have no love for 
you, although you loved Me even before the marriage. 
"As I have already explained, I am not very much interested in family 
life or love between husband and wife. By nature, I am not very fond of 
family life, wife, children, home and opulences. As My devotees are always 
neglectful of all these worldly possessions, I am also like that. Actually, I 
am interested in self-realization; that gives Me pleasure, and not this family 
life." After submitting His statement, Lord Kr�p.a suddenly stopped. 
The great authority Sukadeva Gosvami remarks that Kr��a almost always 
passed His time with Rukmip.i, and Rukmip.i was a bit proud to be so for­
tunate that Kr�p.a never left her even for a moment. Kr�p.a, however, does 
not like any of His devotees to be proud. As soon as a devotee becomes so, 
by some tactic He cuts down that pride. In this case also, Kr�p.a said many 
things which were hard for Rukmip.i to hear. She could only conclude that 
although she was proud of her position, Kr�p.a could be separated from her 
at any moment. 
Rukmip.i was conscious that her husband was not an ordinary human 
being. He was the Supreme Personality of Godhead, the master of the three 
worlds. By the way He was speaking, she was afraid of being separated from 
the Lord, for she had never heard such harsh words from Kr�p.a before. 
Thus she became perplexed with fear of separation, and her heart began to 
palpitate. Without replying to a word of Kr�p.a 's statement, she simply cried 
in great anxiety, as if being drowned in an ocean of grief. She silently 
scratched the ground with the nails of her toes, which were reflecting 
reddish light on the ground. The tears from her eyes were pink, mixed 
with the black cosmetic ointment from her eyelids, and the waters were 
dropping down, washing the kunkuma and saffron from her breasts. 
Choked up on account of great anxiety, unable to speak even a word, she 
kept her head downward and remained standing just like a stick. Due to 
Talks Between Kr�!la and Rukmi!li 
39 
extremely painful fearfulness and lamentation, she lost all her reasoning 
powers and became so weak that immediately her body lost so much 
weight that the bangles on her wrists became slackened. The ciimara rod 
with which she was serving Kr��a immediately fell from her hand. Her 
brain and memory became puzzled, and she lost consciousness. The nicely 
combed hair on her head scattered here and there, and she fell down 
straight, like a banana tree cut down by a whirlwind. 
Lord Kr��a immediately realized that Rukmi�i had not taken His words 
in a joking spirit. She had taken them very seriously, and in her extreme 
anxiety over immediate separation from Him, she had fallen into this 
condition. Lord Sri Kr��a is naturally very affectionate toward His 
devotees, and seeing Rukmi�i's condition, His heart immediately became 
softened. At once He became merciful to her. The relationship between 
Kr��a and Rukmi�i was as Lak�mi-Naraya�a; therefore, He appeared before 
her in His four-handed manifestation of Naraya�a. He got down from the 
bedstead, brought her up by her hands, and, placing His cooling hands on 
her face, smoothed the scattered hairs on her head. Lord Kr��a dried the 
wet breast of Rukmip.iji with His hand. Understanding the seriousness of 
Rukmi�i's love for Him, He embraced her to His chest. 
The Supreme Personality is very expert in putting a thing reasonably for 
one's understanding, and thus He tried to retract all that He said before. 
He is the only resort for all the devotees, and so He knows very well how 
to satisfy His pure devotees. Kr��a understood that Rukmip.i could not 
follow the statements which He had made in a joking way. To counteract 
her confusion, He again began to speak, as follows. 
"My dear daughter of King Vidarbha, My dear Rukmip.i, please do not 
misunderstand Me. Don't be unkind unto Me like this. I know you are 
sincerely and seriously attached to Me; you are My eternal companion. 
The words which have affected you so much are not factual. I wanted to 
irritate you a bit, and I was expecting you to make counter answers to 
those joking words. Unfortunately, you have taken them seriously; I am 
very sorry for it. I expected that your red lips would tremble in anger on 
hearing My statement and you would chastise Me in many words. 0 
perfection of love, I never expected that your condition would be like 
this. I expected that you would put your blinking eyes upon Me in 
retaliation, and in that way, I would be able to see your beautiful face in 
that angry mood. 
"My dear beautiful wife, you know that we are householders. We are 
always busy in many household affairs, so we long for a time that we can 
enjoy some joking words between us. That is our ultimate game in 
40 
Kr��a, the Supreme Personality of Godhead 
household life. Actually, the householders work very hard day and night, 
but all fatigue of the day's labor becomes minimized as soon as they meet, 
husband and wife together, and enjoy life in many ways." Lord Kr��a 
wanted to exhibit Himself just as an ordinary householder who delights 
himself by exchanging joking words with his wife. He therefore repeatedly 
requested Rukmi�i not to take those words very seriously. 
In this way, when Lord K��a pacified Rukmi�i by His sweet words, 
she could understand that what was formerly spoken by Him was not 
actually meant, but was spoken to evoke some joking pleasure between 
themselve�. She was therefore pacified by hearing the words of Kr��a. 
Gradually she was freed from all fearfulness of separation from Him, and 
she began to look on His face very cheerfully with her naturally smiling 
face. She said, "My dear lotus-eyed Lord, Your statement that we are not 
a fit combination is completely right. It is not possible for me to come to 
an equal level with You because You are the reservoir of all qualities, the 
unlimited Supreme Personality of Godhead. How can I be a fit match 
for You? There is no possibility of comparison with You, who are 
the master of all greatness, controller of the three qualities and the object 
of worship for great demigods like Brahma and Lord Siva. As far as I am 
concerned, I am a production of the three modes of material nature. The 
three modes of material nature are impediments towards the progressive 
advancement of devotional service. When and where can I be a fit match 
for You? My dear husband, You have rightly said also that being afraid of 
the kings, You have taken shelter in the water of the sea. But who is the 
king of this material world? I do not think that the so-called royal 
families are kings of the material world. The kings of the material world 
are the three modes of material nature. They are actually the controllers 
of this material world. You are situated in the core of everyone's heart, 
where You remain completely aloof from the touch of the three modes 
of material nature, and there is not doubt about it. 
"You say You always maintain enmity with the worldly kings. But who 
are the worldly kings? I think the worldly kings are the senses. They are 
most formidable, and they control everyone. Certainly You maintain 
enmity with these material senses. You are never under the control of 
the senses; rather, You are the controller of the senses, Hr�ikesa. My dear 
Lord, You have said that You are bereft of all royal power, and that is also 
correct. Not only are You bereft of material world supremacy, but even 
Your servants, those who have some attachment to Your lotus feet, also 
give up the material world supremacy because they consider the material 
position to be the darkest region, which checks the progress of spiritual 
Talks Between Kr��a and Rukmi�i 
41 
enlightenment. Your servants do not like material supremacy, so what to 
speak of You? My dear Lord, Your statement that You do not act as an 
ordinary person with a particular aim 
m life is also perfectly correct. 
Even Your great devotees and servants, known as great sages and saintly 
persons, remain in such a state that no one can get any clue to the aim of 
their lives. They are considered by the human society to be crazy and 
cynical. Their aim of life remains a mystery to the common _human being; 
the lowest of the mankind can know neither You nor Your servant. 
A contaminated human being cannot even imagine the pastimes of You 
and Your devotees. 0 unlimited one, when the activities and endeavors of 
Your devotees remain a mystery to the common human being, how can 
they understand Your motive and endeavor? All kinds of energies and 
opulences are engaged in Your service, but still they are resting at 
Your shelter. 
"You have described Yourself as penniless, but this condition is not 
poverty. Since there is nothing in existence but Yourself, You do not 
require to possess anything-You Yourself are everything. Unlike others, 
You do not require to purchase anything extraneously. With You all 
contrary things can be adjusted because You are absolute. You do not 
possess anything, but no one is richer than You. In the material world no 
one can be rich without possessing. Since Your Lordship is absolute, You 
can adjust the contradiction of possessing nothing but at the same time 
being the richest. In the Vedas it is stated that although You have no 
material hands and legs, You accept everything which is offered in devotion 
by the devotees. You have no material eyes and ears, but stillY ou can see 
everything everywhere, and You can hear everything everywhere. Although 
You do not possess anything, the great demigods who accept prayers and 
worship from others come and worship You to solicit Your mercy. 
How can You be categorized among the poor? 
·"My dear Lord, You have also stated that the richest section of human
society does not worship You. This is also correct, because persons who 
are puffed up with material possessions think of utilizing their property 
for sense gratification. When a poverty-stricken man becomes rich, he 
makes a program for sense gratification. This is due to his ignorance of 
how to utilize his hard-earned money. Under the spell of the external 
energy, he thinks that his money is properly employed in sense gratification, 
and thus he neglects to render transcendental service. My dear Lord, You 
have stated that persons who possess nothing are very dear to You; 
renouncing everything, Your devotee wants to possess You only. I see, 
therefore, that a great sage like Narada Muni who does not possess any 
42 
Kr��a, the Supreme Personality of Godhead 
material property is still very dear to You. And such persons do not care 
for anything but Your Lordship. 
"My dear Lord, You have stated that a marriage between persons equal 
in status of social standing, beauty, riches, strength, influence and renun­
ciation can be a suitable match. But this status of life can only be possible 
by Your grace. You are the supreme perfectional source of all opulences. 
Whatever opulent status of life one may have is all derived from You. As 
described in the Vediinta-siltra, janmiidyasya yata�: You are the supreme 
source from which everything emanates, the reservoir of all pleasures. 
Therefore, persons who are endowed with knowledge desire only to 
achieve You, and nothing else. To achieve Your favor, they give up 
everything-even the transcendental realization of Brahman. You are 
the supreme ultimate goal of life. You are the reservoir of all interests 
of the living entities. Those who are actually well-motivated desire only 
You, and for this reason they give up everything to attain success. They 
therefore deserve to be associated with You. In the society of the servitors 
and served in Kr�!la consciousness, one is not subjected to the pains and 
pleasures of material society, which functions according to sex attraction. 
Therefore, everyone, man or woman, should seek to be an associate in Your 
society of servitors and served. You are the Supreme Personality of 
Godhead; no one can excel You, nor can anyone come up to an equal 
level with You. The perfect social system is that in which You remain in 
the center, being served as the Supreme, and all others engage as Your 
servitors. In such a perfectly constructed society, everyone can remain 
eternally happy and blissful. 
"My Lord, You have stated that only the beggars praise Your glories, 
and that is also perfectly correct. But who are those beggars? Those 
beggars are all exalted devotees, liberated personalities and those in the 
renounced order of life. They are all great souls and devotees who have no 
other business than to glorify You. Such great souls forgive even the 
worst offender. These so-called beggars execute their spiritual advancement 
of life, tolerating all kinds of tribulations in the material world. My dear 
husband, do not think that out of my inexperience I accepted You as my 
husband; actually, I followed all these great souls. I followed the path of 
these great beggars and decided to surrender my life unto Your lotus feet. 
"You have said that You are penniless, and that is correct. You dis­
tribute Yourself completely to these great souls and devotees. Knowing 
this fact perfectly well, I rejected even such great personalities like Lord 
Brahma and King Indra. My Lord, the great time factor acts under Your 
direction only. The time factor is so great and powerful that within 
Talks Between Kr��a and Rukmi�i 
43 
.moments it can effect devastation anywhere within the creation. Con­
sidering all these factors, I thought J arasandha, Sisupala and similar other 
princes who wanted to marry Me to be no more important than ordinary 
insects. 
"My dear all-powerful son of Vasudeva, Your statement that You have 
taken shelter within the water of the ocean, being afraid of all the great 
princes, is quite suitable, but my experience with You contradicts this. I 
have actually seen that You kidnapped me forcibly in the presence of all 
these princes. At the time of my marriage ceremony, simply by giving a 
jerk to the string of Your bow, You very easily drove the others away and 
kindly gave me shelter at Your lotus feet. I still remember vividly that You 
kidnapped me in the same way as a lion forcibly takes his share of hunted 
booty, driving away all other small animals within the twinkling of an eye. 
"My dear lotus-eyed Lord, I cannot understand Your statement that 
women and other persons who have taken shelter under Your lotus feet 
pass their days only in bereavement. From the history of the world we can 
see that princes like Ari.ga, Prthu, Bharata, Yayati and Gaya were all gre.at 
emperors of the world, and there were no competitors to their exalted 
positions. But in order to achieve the favor of Your lotus feet, they re­
nounced their exalted positions and. entered into the forest to practice 
penances and. austerities. When they voluntarily accepted such a position, 
accepting Your lotus feet as all in all, does it mean that they were in 
lamentation and bereavement? 
"My dear Lord, You have advised me that I can still select another from 
the princely order and divorce myself of Your companionship. But, my 
dear Lord, it is perfectly well-known to m� that You are the reservoir of all 
good qualities. Great saintly persons like Narada Muni are always engaged 
simply in glorifying Your transcendental characteristics. If someone simply 
takes shelter of such a saintly person, he immediately becomes freed from 
all material contamination. And by coming in direct contact with Your 
service the goddess of fortune agrees to bestow all her blessings. Under the 
circumstances, what woman who has once heard of Your glories from 
authoritative sources and somehow or other has tasted the nectarean flavor 
of Your lotus feet can be foolish enough to agree to marry someone of 
this material world who is always afraid of death, disease; old age and 
rebirth? I have therefore accepted Your lotus feet, not without considera­
tion, but after mature and deliberate decision. My dear Lord, You are th6 
master of the three worlds. You can fulfill all the desires of all Your devo­
tees in this world and the next, because You are the Supreme Soul of 
everyone. I have therefore selected You as my husband, considering You 
44 
Kr��a, the Supreme Personality of Godhead 
to be the only fit personality. You may throw me in any species of life 
according to the reaction of my fruitive activities, and I haven't the least 
concern for this. My only ambition is that I may always remain fast to 
Your lotus feet, because You can deliver Your devotees from the illusory 
material existence and are always prepared to distribute Yourself to Your 
devotees. 
"My dear Lord, You have advised me to select one of the princes such 
as Sisupala, J arasandha or Dantavakra, but what is their position in this 
world? They are always engaged in hard labor to maintain their household 
life, just like the bulls working hard day and night with the oil-pressing 
machine. They are compared to asses, beasts of burden. They are always 
dishonored like the dogs, and they are miserly like the cats. They have sold 
themselves like slaves to their wives. Any unfortunate woman who has 
never heard of Your glories may accept such a man as her husband, but a 
woman who has learned about You-that You are praised not only in this 
world, but in the halls of the great demigods like Lord Brahma and Lord 
Siva-will not accept anyone besides Yourself as her husband. A man 
within this material world is just a dead body. In fact, superficially, the 
living entity is covered by this body, which is nothing but a bag of skin 
decorated with beards and moustaches, hairs on the body, nails on the 
fingers and hairs on the head. Within this decorated bag there are bunches 
of muscles, bundles of bones, and pools of blood, always mixed up with 
stool, urine, mucus, bile and polluted air, and enjoyed by different kinds 
of insects and germs. A foolish woman accepts such a dead body as her 
husband and, in sheer misunderstanding, loves him as her dear companion. 
This is only possible because such a woman has never tasted the ever­
blissful flavor of Your lotus feet. 
"My dear lotus-eyed husband, You are self-satisfied. You do not care 
whether or not I am beautiful or qualified; You are not at all concerned 
about it. Therefore Your nonattachment for me is not at all astonishing; it 
is quite natural. You cannot be attached to any woman, however exalted 
her position and beauty. Whether You are attached to me or not, may my 
devotion and attention be always engaged at Your lotus feet. The material 
mode of passion is also Your creation, so when You passionately glance 
upon me, I accept it as the greatest boon of my life. I am ambitious only 
for such auspicious moments." 
. After hearing Rukmi�i's statement and her clarification of each and 
every word which He had used to arouse her anger of love toward Him, 
Kr��a addressed Rukmi�i as follows: "My dear chaste wife, My dear 
princess, I was expecting such an explanation from you, and for this 
Talks Between Kr�!la and Rukmi!li 
45 
purpose only I spoke all those joking words, so that you might be cheated" 
of the real point of view. Now My purpose has been served. The wonderful 
explanation that you have given to each and every word of Mine is com­
pletely factual and approved by Me. 0 most beautiful Rukmi!li, You are 
My dearmost wife. I am greatly pleased to understand how much love you 
have for Me. Please take it for granted that no matter what ambition and 
desire you might have and no matter what you might expect from Me, I 
am always at your service. And it is a fact also that My devotees, My "dear­
most friends and servitors, are always free from material contamination, 
even though they are not inclined to ask from Me such liberation. My 
devotees never desire anything from Me except to be engaged in My service. 
And yet because they are completely dependent upon Me, even if they are 
found to ask something from Me, that is not material. Such ambitions and 
desires, instead of becoming the cause of material bondage, become the 
source of liberation from this material world. 
"My dear chaste and pious wife, I have tested, on the basis of strict 
chastity, your love for your husband, and you have passed the examination 
most successfully. I have purposely agitated you by speaking many words 
which were not applicable to your character, but I am surprised to see that 
not a pinch of your devotion to Me has been deviated from its fixed 
position. My dear wife, I am the bestower of all benedictions, even up to 
the standard ofliberation from this material world, and it is I only who can 
stop the continuation of material existence and call one back to home, 
back to Godhead. One whose devotion for Me is adulterated worships Me 
for some material benefit, just to keep himself in the world of material 
happiness, culminating in the pleasure of sex life. One who engages himself 
in severe penance and austerities just to attain this material happiness is 
certainly under the illusion of My external energy. Persons who are en­
gaged in My devotional service simply for the purpose of material gains 
and sense gratification certainly are very foolish. Material happiness based 
on sex life is available in the most abominable species of life, such as the 
hogs and dogs. No one should try to approach Me for such happiness, 
because it is available even if one is put into a hellish condition of life. It 
is better, therefore, for persons who are simply after material happiness 
and not after Me to remain in that hellish condition." 
Material contamination is so strong that everyone is working very hard 
day and night for materia! happiness. The show of religiousness, austerity 
penance, humanitarianism, philanthropy, politics, science-everything is 
aimed at realizing some material benefit. For the immediate success of 
material benefit, the materialistic persons generally worship different demi-
46 
Kr�pa, the Supreme Personality of Godhead 
gods, and under the spell of material propensities they sometimes take to 
the devotional service of the Lord. Sometimes it so happens that if a 
person sincerely serves the Lord and at the same time maintains material 
ambition, the Lord very kindly removes the sources of material happiness. 
Without finding any recourse in material happiness, the devotee then en­
gages himself absolutely in pure devotional service. 
Lord Kr§tta continued, "My dear best of the queens, it is clearly under­
stood by Me that you have no material ambition; your only purpose is to 
serve Me, and you have long been engaged in unalloyed service. Exemplary 
unalloyed devotional service not only can bestow upon the devotee libera­
tion from this material world, but it also promotes him to the spiritual 
world for being eternally engaged in My service. Persons who are too 
addicted to material happiness cannot·render such service. Women whose 
hearts are polluted and full of material desires devise various means of sense 
gratification while outwardly showing themselves to be great devotees. 
"My dear honored wife, although I have thousands of wives, I do not 
think that any one of them can love Me more than you. The practical 
proof of your extraordinary position is that you had never seen Me before 
your marriage; you had simply heard about Me from a third person, and 
still your faith in Me was so fixed that even in the presence of many quali­
fied, rich and beautiful men of the royal order, you did not select any one 
of them as your husband, but insisted on having Me. You neglected all the 
princes present, and very politely you sent Me a confidential letter inviting 
Me to kidnap you. While I was kidnapping you, your elder brother Rukmi 
violently protested and fought with Me. As a result of the fight, I defeated 
him mercilessly and disfigured his body. At the time of Aniruddha's 
marriage, when we were all engaged in playing chess, there was another 
fight with your brother Rukmi on a controversial verbal point, and My 
elder brother Balarama finally killed him. I was surprised to see that you 
did not utter even a word of protest over this incidence. Because of your 
great anxiety that you might be separated from Me, you suffered all. the 
consequences without speaking even a word. As the result of this great 
silence, My dear wife, you have purchased Me for all time; I have become 
eternally under your control. You sent your messenger to Me inviting Me 
to kidnap you, and when you found that there was a little delay in My 
arriving on the spot, you began to see the whole world as vacant. At that 
time you concluded that your beautiful body was not fit to be touched by 
anyone else; therefore, thinking that I was not coming, you decided to 
commit suicide and immediately end that body. My dear RukmitJ.i, such 
great and exalted love for Me will always remain within My soul. As far as 
Talks Between Kr��a and Rukmi�i 
47 
I am concerned, it is not within My power to repay you for your unalloyed 
devotion to Me." 
The Supreme Personality of Godhead Kr��a certainly has no business 
being anyone's husband or son or father, because everything belongs to 
Him and everyone is under His control. He does not require anyone's help 
for His satisfaction. He is iitmiiriima, self-satisfied; He can derive all pleasure 
by Himself, without anyone's help. When the Lord descends to play the 
part of a human being, He plays a role either as a husband, son, friend or 
enemy, in full perfection. As such, when He was playing as the perfect 
husband of the queens, especially of Rukmi�iji, He enjoyed conjugal love 
in complete perfection. 
According to Vedic culture, although polygamy is allowed, none of the 
wives should be ill-treated. In other words, one may take many wives only 
if he is able to satisfy all of them equally as an ideal householder; otherwise 
it is not allowed. Lord Kr��a is the world-teacher; therefore, even though 
He had no need for a wife, He expanded Himself into as many forms as He 
had wives, and He lived with them as an ideal householder, observing the 
regulative principles, rules and commitments in accordance with the Vedic 
injunctions and the social laws and customs of society. For each of His 
16,108 wives, He simultaneously maintained different palaces, different 
establishments and different atmospheres. Thus the Lord, although one, 
exhibited Himself as 16,108 ideal householders. 
Thus ends the Bhaktivedanta purport of the Second Volume, Fifth 
Chapter, of Kr��a, "Talks Between K[f!W and Rukmir-i." 
6 I The Genealogical Table 
of the Family of Kr��a 
Kr��a had 16,108 wives, and in each of them He begot ten sons, all of 
them equal to their father in the opulences of strength, beauty, wisdom, 
fame, wealth and renunciation. "Like father like son." All the 16,108
wives of Kr��a were princesses, and when each saw that Kr��a was always 
present in her respective palace and did not leave home, they considered 
Kr��a to be a henpecked husband who was very much attached to them. 
Every one of them thought that Kr��a was her very obedient husband, 
but actually Kr��a had no attraction for any of them. Although each 
thought that she was the only wife of Kr��a and was very, very dear to 
Him, Lord Kr��a, since He is iitmiiriima, self-sufficient, was neither dear 
nor inimical to any one of them; He was equal to all the wives and treated 
them as a perfect husband just to please them. For Him, there was no need 
for even a single wife. In fact, since they were women, the wives could not 
understand the exalted position of Kr��a nor the truths about Him. 
All the princesses who were wives of Kr��a were exquisitely beautiful, 
and each one of them was attracted by Kr��a's eyes, which were just like 
lotus petals, and by His beautiful face, long arms, broad ears, pleasing 
smile, humorous talk and sweet words. Influenced by these features of 
Kr��a, they all used to dress themselves very attractively, desiring to attract 
Krwa by their feminine bodily appeal. They used to exhibit their feminine 
characteristics by smiling and moving their eyebrows, thus throwing 
sharpened arrows of conjugal love just to awaken Kr��a 's lusty desires for 
them. Still, they could not arouse the mind of Kr��a or His sex appetite. 
This means that Kr��a never had any sex relations with any of His many 
wives, save and except to beget children. 
The queens of Dvaraka were so fortunate that they got Lord Sri Kr��a 
as their husband and personal companion, although He is not approachable 
by exalted demigods like Brahma. They remained together as husband and 
48 
The Genealogical Table of the Family of Kr��a 
49 
wife, and Krwa, as an ideal husband, treated them in such a way that at 
every moment there was an increase of transcendental bliss in their smiling 
exchanges, talking and mixing together. Each and every wife had hundreds 
and thousands of maidservants, yet when Kr��a entered the palaces of His 
thousands of wives, each one of them used to receive Kr��a personally by 
seating Him in a nice chair, worshiping Him with all requisite paraphernalia, 
personally washing His lotus feet, offering Him betel nuts, massaging His 
legs to relieve them from fatigue, fanning Him to make Him comfortable, 
offering all kinds of scented sandalwood pulp, oils and aromatics, putting 
flower garlands on His neck, dressing His hair, getting Him to lie down on 
the bed and assisting Him in taking His bath. Thus they served always in 
every respect, especially when Kr��a was eating. They were always engaged 
in the service of the Lord. 
Of the 16,108 queens of Kr��a, each of whom had ten sons, there is the 
following list of the sons of the first eight queens. By Rukmi�i, Kr��a had 
ten sons: Pradyumna, Carude��a, Sude��a, Carudeha, Sucaru, Carugupta, 
Bhadracaru, Carucandra, Vicaru, and Caru. None of them were inferior in 
their qualities to their divine father, Lord Kr��a. Similarly, Satyabhama 
had ten sons, and their names are as follows: Bhanu, Subhanu, Svarbhanu, 
Prabhanu, Bhanuman, Candrabhanu, Brhadbhanu, Atibhanu, Sribhanu and 
. 
Pratibhanu. The next queen, Jambavati, had ten sons, headed by Samba. 
Their names are as follows: Samba, Sumitra, Purujit, Satajit, Sahasrajit, 
Vijaya, Citraketu, Vasuman, Dravi�a and Kratu. Lord Krwa was specifically 
very affectionate to the sons of Jambavati. By His wife Satya, the daughter 
of King N agnajit, Lord Kr��a had ten sons. They are as follows: Vir a,. 
Candra, Asvasena, Citragu, Vega van, V r�a, Ama, Sariku, V asu and Kunti.­
Amongst all of them, Kunti was very powerful. Kr��a had ten sons by 
Kalindi, and they are as follows: Sruta, Kavi, Vr�a, Vira, Subahu, Bhadra, 
Santi, Dar8a, Piir�amasa and the youngest, Somaka. For His next wife, 
Lak�ma�a, the daughter of the King of Madras Province, He begot ten 
sons, of the names Pragho�a, Gatravan, Simha, Bala, Prabala, Urdhvaga, 
Mahasakti, Saha, Oja and Aparajita. Similarly, His next wife, Mitravinda, 
had ten sons. They are as follows: Vrka, Har�a, Anila, Grdhra, Vardhana, 
Annada, Mahamsa, Pavana, V ahni and Ksudhi. His next wife, Bhadra, had 
ten sons, of the names Sarigramajit, Brhatsena, Sura, Prahara�a, Arijit, 
Jaya, Subhadra, Varna, Ayu and Satyaka. Besides these eight chief queens, 
Krwa had 16,100 other wives, and all of them had ten sons each. 
The eldest son of Rukmi�i, Pradyumna, was married with Mayavati from 
his very birth, and afterwards he was again married with Rukmavati, the 
daughter of his maternal uncle, Rukmi. From this Rukmavati, Pradyumna 
50 
Kr��a, the Supreme Personality of Godhead 
had a son named Aniruddha. In this way, Kr��a's family-Kr��a and His 
wives, along with their sons and grandsons and even great-grandsons-all 
combined together to include very nearly one billion family members. 
Rukmi, the elder brother of KH9-a's first wife, Rukmi9-i, was greatly 
harrassed and insulted in his fight with Kr��a, but on the request of 
Rukmi9-i his life was saved. Since then Rukmi had held a great grudge 
against Krwa and was always inimical toward Him. Nevertheless, his 
daughter was married with Kr�9-a's son, and his granddaughter was married 
with Kr�9-a's grandson, Aniruddha. This fact appeared to be a little aston­
ishing to Maharaja Parik�it when he heard it from Sukadeva Gosvami. "I 
am surprised that Rukmi and Kr�9-a, who were so greatly inimical to one 
another, could again be united by marital relationships between their 
descendants." Parik�it Maharaja was curious about the mystery of this 
incident, and therefore he inquired further from Sukadeva Gosvami 
Because Sukadeva Gosvami was a practical yogi, nothing was hidden from 
his power of insight. A perfect yogi like Sukadeva Gosvami can see past, 
present and future in all details. Therefore, from such yogis or mystics 
there can be nothing concealed. When Panlqit Maharaja inquired from 
Sukadeva Gosvami, Sukadeva Gosvami answered as follows. 
Pradyumna, the eldest son of Kr��a, born of Rukmi�i, was Cupid 
himself. He was so beautiful and attractive that the daughter of Rukmi, 
namely Rukmavati, could not select any husband other than Pradyumna 
during her svayarhvara. Therefore, in that selection meeting, she garlanded 
Pradyumna in the presence of all other princes. When there was a fight 
among the princes, Pradyumna came out victorious, and therefore Rukmi 
was obliged to offer his beautiful daughter to him. Although a far-off 
enmity was always blazing in the heart of Rukmi because of his being 
insulted by Kr�9-a's kidnapping of his sister Rukmi9-i, when his daughter 
selected Pradyumna as her husband Rukmi could not resist consenting 
to the marriage ceremony just to please his sister, Rukmi9-i. And so 
Pradyumna became the nephew of Rukmi. Besides the ten sons described 
above, Rukmi9-i had one beautiful daughter with big eyes, and she was 
married to the son of Krtavarma, whose name was Bali. 
Although Rukmi was a veritable enemy of Kr��a, he had great affection 
for his sister, Rukmi�i, and he wanted to please her in all respects. On this 
account, when Rukmi�i's grandson Aniruddha was to be married, Rukmi 
offered his granddaughter Rocana to Aniruddha. Such marriage between 
immediate cousins is not very much sanctioned by the Vedic culture, but 
in order to please Rukmi�i, Rukmi offered his daughter and granddaughter 
to the son and grandson of Kr�9-a. In this way, when the negotiation of the 
The Genealogical' Table of the Family of Kr��a 
51 
marriage of Aniruddha with Rocana was complete, a big marriage party 
accompanied Aniruddha and started from Dvaraka. They travelled until 
they reached Bhojakata, which Rukmi had colonized after his sister had 
been kidnapped by Kr�!la. This marriage party was led by the grandfather, 
namely Lord Kr��a, accompanied by Lord Balarama, as well as Kr�!la's 
first wife, Rukmi!li, His son Pradyumna, Jambavati's son Samba and many 
other relatives and family members. They reached the town of Bhojakata, 
and the marriage ceremony was peacefully performed. 
The King of Kalinga was a friend of Rukmi's, and he gave him the ill 
advice to play with Balarama and thus defeat Him in a bet. Amongst the 
k§atriya kings, betting and gambling in chess was not uncommon. If 
someone challenged a friend to play on the chessboard, the friend could 
not deny the challenge. Sri Balaramaji was not a very expert chess player, 
and this was known to the King of Kaliilga. So Rukmi was advised to 
retaliate against the family members of Kr�!la by challenging Balarama to 
play chess. Although not a very expert chess player, Sri Balaramaji was 
very enthusiastic in sporting activities. He accepted the challenge of Rukmi 
and sat 
down to play. Betting was with gold coins, and Balarama 
first of all challenged with one hundred coins, then 1,000 coins, then 
10,000 coins. Each time, Balarama lost, and Rukmi became victorious. 
Sri Balarama's losing the game was an opportunity for the King of 
Kaliilga to criticize Kr�!la and Balarama. Thus the King of Kaliilga was 
talking jokingly and purposefully showing his teeth to Balarama. Because 
Balarama was the loser in the game, He was a little intolerant of the 
sarcastic joking words. He became a little agitated, and when Rukmi again 
challenged Baladima, he made a bet of 100,000 gold coins. Fortunately, 
this time Balarama won. Although Balaramaji had won, Rukmi, out of his 
cunningness, began to claim that BaHuama was the loser and that he 
himself had won. Because of this lie, Balaramaji became most angry with 
Rukmi. His agitation was so sudden and great that it appeared like a tidal 
wave in the ocean on a full moon day. Balarama 's eyes are naturally 
reddish, and when He became agitated and angry His eyes became more 
reddish. This time He challenged and made a bet of a hundred million coins. 
Again Balarama was the winner according to the rules of chess, but 
Rukmi again cunningly began to claim that he had won. Rukmi appealed 
to the princes present, and He especially mentioned the name of the King 
of Kaliilga. At that time there was a voice from the air during the dispute, 
and it announced that for all honest purposes Balarama, the actual winner 
of this game, was being abused and that the statement of Rukmi that he 
had won was absolutely false. 
52 
Kr��a, the Supreme Personality of Godhead 
In spite of this divine voice, Rukmi insisted that Balarama had lost, and 
by his persistence it appeared that he had death upon his head. Falsely 
puffed up by the ill advice of his friend, he did not give much importance 
to the oracle, and he began to criticize Balaramaji. He said, "My dear 
Balaramaji, You two brothers, cowherd boys only, may be very ex­
pert in tending cows, but how can You be expert in playing chess 
or shooting arrows on the battlefield? These arts are well-known only to 
the princely order." Hearing this kind of pinching talk by Rukmi and 
hearing the loud laughter of all the other princes present there, Lord 
Balarama became as agitated as burning cinders. He immediately took a 
club in His hand and, without any further talk, struck Rukmi on the head. 
From that one blow, Rukmi fell down immediately and was dead and 
gone. Thus Rukmi was killed by Balarama on that auspicious occasion of 
Aniruddha's marriage. 
These things are not very uncommon in k§atriya society, and the King 
of Kalinga, being afraid that he would be the next to be attacked, fled 
from the scene. Before he could escape even a few steps, however, 
Balaramaji immediately captured him and, because the King was always 
showing his teeth while criticizing Balarama and Kr��a, broke all his teeth 
with His club. The other princes who were supporting the King of Kalinga 
and Rukmi were also captured, and Balarama beat them with His club, 
breaking their legs and hands. They did not try to retaliate but thought it 
wise to run away from the bloody scene. 
During this strife between Balarama and Rukmi, Lord Kr��a did not 
utter a word, for He knew that if He supported Balarama Rukmi�i would 
be unhappy, and if He said that the killing of Rukmi was unjust, then 
Balarama would be unhappy. Therefore, Lord Kr��a was silent on the 
death of His brother-in-law, Rukmi, on the occasion of His grandson's 
marriage. He did not disturb either His affectionate relationship with 
Balarama or with Rukmi�i. After this, the bride and the bridegroom 
were ceremoniously seated on the chariot, and they started for Dvaraka, 
accompanied by the bridegroom's party. The bridegroom's party was 
always protected by Lord Kr��a, the killer of the Madhu demon. Thus 
they left Rukmi's kingdom, Bhojakata, and happily started for Dvaraka. 
Thus ends the Bhaktivedanta purport of the Second Volume, Sixth 
Chapter of Kr§�a, "The Genealogical Table of the Family of K[§[W." 
7 I The Meeting of U�a and Aniruddha 
The meeting of Aniruddha and U�a, which caused a great fight between 
Lord Kr��a and Lord Siva, is very mysterious and interesting. Maharaja 
PanK:�it was anxious to hear the whole story from Sukadeva Gosvami, and 
thus Sukadeva narrated it. "My dear King, you must have heard the name 
of King Bali. He was a great devotee who gave away in charity all that he 
had-namely, the whole world-to Lord Vamana, the incarnation of Vi��u 
as a dwarf briihmarz,a. King Bali had one hundred sons, and the eldest of all 
of them was Ba�asura." 
This great hero Ba�asura, born of Maharaja Bali, was a great devotee of 
Lord Siva and was always ready to render service unto him. Because of his 
devotion, he achieved a great position in society, and he was honored in 
every respect. Actually, he was very intelligent and liberal also, and his 
activities are all praiseworthy because he never deviated from his promise 
and word of honor; he was very truthful and fixed in his vow. In those 
days, he was ruling over the city of Sonitapura. By the grace of Lord Siva, 
Ba�asura had one thousand hands, 'and he became so powerful that even 
demigods like King Indra were serving him as most obedient servants. 
Long ago, when Lord Siva was dancing in his celebrated fashion called 
tiirz,flava-nrtya, for which he is known as Nataraja, Ba�asura helped Lord 
Siva in his dancing by rythmically beating drums with his one thousand 
hands. Lord Siva is well-known as Asuto�a, very easily pleased, and he is 
also very affectionate to his devotees. He is a great protector for persons 
who take shelter of him and is the master of all living entities in this 
material world. Being pleased with Ba�asura, he said, "Whatever you desire 
you can have from me because I am very much pleased with you." 
Ba�asura replied, "My dear lord, if you please, you can remain in my city 
just to protect me from the hands of my enemies." 
Once upon a time, Ba�asura came to offer his respects to Lord Siva. By

touching the lotus feet of Lord Siva with his helmet, which was shining 
like the sun globe, he offered his obeisances unto him. While offering his 
respectful obeisances, Ba�asura said, "My dear lord, anyone who has not 
fulfilled his ambition will be able to do so by taking shelter of your lotus 
feet, which are just like desire trees-one can take from them anything he 
desires. My dear lord, you have given me one thousand arms, but I do not 
know what to do with them. Please pardon me, but it appears that I 
cannot use them properly in fighting. I cannot find anyone competent to 
fight with me except your lordship, the original father of the material 
world. Sometimes I feel a great tendency to fight with my arms, and I go 
out to find a suitable warrior. Unfortunately, everyone flees, knowing my 
extraordinary power. Being baffled at not finding a match, I simply satisfy 
the itching of my arms by beating them against the mountains. In this way, 
I tear many great mountains to pieces." 
Lord Siva realized that his benediction had become troublesome for 
Bapasura and addressed him, "You rascal! You are very eager to fight, but 
since you have no one to fight with, you are distressed. Although you 
think that there is no one in the world to oppose you except me, I say that 
you will eventually find such a competent person. At that time your days 
will come to an end, and your flag of victory will no longer fly. Then you 
will see your false prestige smashed to pieces!" 
After hearing Lord Siva's statement, Bapasura became very puffed up 
with his power. He was elated that he would meet someone who would be 
able to smash him to pieces. Bapasura then returned home with�great 
pleasure, and he always waited for the day when the suitable fighter would 
come to cut down his strength. He was such a foolish demon. It appears 
that foolish, demonic human beings, when unnecessarily overpowered with 
material opulences, want to exhibit these opulences, and such foolish 
people feel satisfaction when these opulences are exhausted. The idea is 
that they do not know how to expend their energy for right causes, being 
unaware of the benefit of Kr�pa consciousness. Actually, there are two 
classes of men-one is Krsna conscious, the other is non-Krsna conscious. 
. 
. .

.
 
The non-Kr�pa conscious men are generally devoted to the demigods, 
whereas the Kr�pa conscious men are devoted to the Supreme Personality 
of Godhead. Kr�pa conscious persons utilize everything for the service of 
the Lord. The non-Kr�pa conscious persons utilize everything for sense grati­
faction, and Bapasura is a perfect example of such a person. He was very 
anxious to utilize for his own satisfaction his extraordinary power to fight. 
Not finding any combatant, he struck his powerful hands against the moun­
tains, breaking them into pieces. In contrast to this, Arjuna also possessed 
The Meeting of U�a and Aniruddha 
55 
extraordinary powers for fighting, but he utilized them only for Kr�!la. 
Ba!lasura had a very beautiful daughter, whose name was U �a. When she 
had attained the age of marriage and was sleeping amongst her many girl 
friends, she dreamt one night that Aniruddha was by her side and that she 
was enjoying a conjugal relationship with him, although she had never 
actually seen him nor heard of him before. She awoke from her dream 
exclaiming very loudly, "My dear beloved, where are you?" Being exposed 
to her other friends in this way, she became a little bit ashamed. One of 
U�a's girl friends was Citralekha, who was the daughter of Ba!lasura's prime 
minister. Citralekha and U�a were intimate friends, and out of great 
curiosity Citralekha asked, "My dear beautiful princess, as of yet you are 
not married to any young boy, nor have you seen any boys until now; so 
I am surprised that you are exclaiming like this. Who are you searching 
after? Who is your suitable match?" 
On hearing Citralekha's inquiries, U�a replied, "My dear friend, in my 
dream I saw a nice young man who is very, very beautiful. His complexion 
is swarthy, his eyes are just like lotus petals, and he is dressed in yellow gar­
ments. His arms are very long, and his general bodily features are S<? 
pleasing that any young girl would be attracted. I feel much pride in 
saying that this beautiful young man was kissing me, and I was very much 
enjoying the nectar of his kissing. I am sorry to inform you that just after 
this he disappeared, and I have been thrown into the whirlpool of disap­
pointment. My dear friend, I am very anxious to find this wonderful young 
man, the desired lord of my heart." 
After hearing U�a's words, Citralekha immediately replied, "I can under­
stand your bereavement, and I assure you that if this boy is within these 
three worlds-the upper, middle, and lower planetary systems-! must find 
him for your satisfaction. If you can identify him from your dream, I shall 
bring you peace of mind. Now, let me draw some pictures for you to 
insp�ct, and as soon as you find the picture of your desired husband, 
let me know. It doesn't matter where he is; I know the art of bringing him 
here. So, as soon as you identify him, I shall imrb.ediately arrange for it." 
Citralekha, while talking, began to draw many pictures of the demigods 
inhabiting the higher planetary systems, then pictures of the Gandharvas, 
Siddhas, Cara!las, Pannagas, Daityas, Vidyadharas and Y ak�as, as well as 
many human beings. (The statements of Srimad-Bhiigavatam and other 
Vedic literature prove definitely that on each and every planet there are 
living entities of different varieties. Therefore, it is foolish to assert that 
there are no living entities but those on this earth.) Citralekha painted 
many pictures. Among those of the human beings was the Vr�!li dynasty, 
56 
Kr�pa, the Supreme Personality of Godhead 
including Vasudeva, the father of Kr�pa, Siirasena, the grandfather of 
Kr�pa, Sri Balaramaji, Lord Kr�pa and many others. When U �a saw the 
picture of Pradyumna, she became a little bashful, but when she saw the 
picture of Aniruddha, she became so bashful that she immediately lowered 
her head and smiled, having found the man she was seeking. She identified 
the picture to Citralekha as that of the man who had stolen her heart. 
Citralekha was a great mystic yogini, and as soon as U �a identified the 
picture, although neither of them had ever seen him nor knew his name, 
Citralekha could immediately understand that the picture was of Ani­
ruddha, a grandson of Kr�!la· That very night she traveled in outer space 
and within a very short time reached the city of Dvaraka, which was 
well-protected by Kr�!la. She entered the palace and found Aniruddha 
sleeping in his bedroom on a very opulent bed. Citralekha, by her mystic 
power, immediately brought Aniruddha, in that sleeping condition, to the 
city of Sonitapura so that U�a might see her desired husband. U�a im­
mediately bloomed in happiness and began to enjoy the company of 
Aniruddha with great satisfaction. 
__ 
The palace in which U �a and Citralekha lived was so well fortified that 
it was impossible for any male to either enter or see inside. U �a and 
Aniruddha lived together in the palace, and day after day the love of U �a 
for Aniruddha grew four times upon four times. U�a pleased Aniruddha 
with her valuable dresses, flowers, garlands, scents and incense. By his 
bedside sitting place were other paraphernalia for residential purposes-nice 
drinks such as milk and sherbet and nice eatables which could be chewed 
or swallowed. Above all, she pleased him with sweet words and very 
obliging service. Aniruddha was worshiped by U �a as if he were the 
Supreme Personality of Godhead. By her excellent service, U�a made 
Aniruddha forget all other things and was able to draw his attention and 
love upon her without deviation. In such an atmosphere of love and 
service, Aniruddha practically forgot himself and could not recall how 
many days he had been away from his real home. 
In due course of time, U�a exhibited some bodily symptoms by which 
it could be understood that she was having intercourse with a male friend. 
The symptoms were so prominent that her actions could no longer be 
concealed from anyone. U�a was always cheerful in the association of 
Aniruddha, but she did not know the bounds of her satisfaction. The 
housekeeper and the watchmen of the palace could guess very easily that 
she was having relations with a male friend, and without waiting for 
further development, all of them informed their master, Ba!iasura. In Vedic 
culture, an unmarried girl having association with a male is the greatest 
The Meeting of U�a and Aniruddha 
57 
disgrace to the family, and so the caretaker cautiously informed his master 
that U�a was developing symptoms indicating a disgraceful association. The 
servants informed their master that they were not at all neglectful in 
guarding the house, being alert day and night against any young man who 
might enter. They were so careful that a male could not even see what was 
going on there, and so they were surprised that she had become contami­
nated. Since they could not trace out the reason for it, they submitted the 
whole situation before their master. 
Ba!J.asura was shocked to understand that his daughter U �a was no 
longer a virgin maiden. This weighed heavily on his heart, and without 
delay he rushed towards the palace where U �a was living. There he saw that 
U�a and Aniruddha were sitting together and talking. U�a and Aniruddha 
looked very beautiful together, Aniruddha being the son of Pradyumna, 
who was Cupid himself. Ba!J.asura saw his daughter and Aniruddha as a 
suitable match, yet for family prestige, he did not like the combination at 
all. Ba!J.aSura could not understand who the boy actually was. He appre­
ciated the fact that U �a could not have selected anyone in the three 
worlds more beautiful. Aniruddha's complexion was brilliant and swarthy. 
He was dressed in yellow garments and had eyes just like lotus petals. His 
arms were very long, and he had nice, curling, bluish hair. The glaring rays 
of his glittering earrings and the beautiful smile on his lips were certainly 
captivating. Still, Ba!J.asura was very angry. 
When Ba!J.asura saw him, Aniruddha was engaged in playing with U�a. 
Aniruddha was nicely dressed, and U�a had garlanded him with various 
beautiful flowers. The reddish kunkuma powder put on the breasts of 
women was spotted here and there on the garland, indicating that U �a had 
embraced him. Ba!J.asura was struck with wonder that, even in his presence, 
Aniruddha was peacefully sitting in front of U�a. Aniruddha knew, how­
ever, that his would-be father-in-law was not at all pleased and that he was 
gathering many soldiers in the palace to attack him. 
Thus, not finding any other weapon, Aniruddha took hold of a big iron 
rod and stood up before Ba!J.asura and his soldiers. He firmly took a posture 
indicating that if he were attacked he would strike all of the soldiers down 
to the ground with the iron rod. Ba\}asura and his company of soldiers saw 
that the boy was standing before them just like the superintendent of 
death with his invincible rod. Now, under the order of Banasura, the 
. 
soldiers from all sides attempted to capture and arrest him. When they 
dared to come before him, Aniruddha struck them with the rod, breaking 
their heads, legs, arms and thighs, and one after another, they began to fall 
to the ground. He killed them just as the leader of a flock of hawks kills 
-

Kr��a, the Supreme Personality of Godhead 
barking dogs, one after another . .In this way, Aniruddha was able to escape 
the palace. 
Ba!iasura knew various arts of fighting, and by the grace of Lord Siva, 
he knew how to arrest his opposing enemy by the use of a niigapiiSa, 
sna�e-noose, and so Aniruddha was seized as he. came out of the palace. 
When U�a received the news that her father had arrested Aniruddha, she 
became overwhelmed with grief and confusion. Tears began to glide down 
her eyes, and being unable to check herself, she began to cry very loudly. 
Thus ends the Bhaktivedanta purport of the Second Volume, Seventh 
Chapter, of Kr�!ia, "The Meeting of U§ii and A niruddha. " 
8 I Lord Kr��a Fights with Ba�asura 
When the four months of the rainy season passed and still Aniruddha 
had not returned home, all the members of the Y adu family became much 
perturbed. They could not understand how the boy was missing. Fortu­
nately, one day the great sage Narada came and informed the family about 
Aniruddha's disappearance from the palace. He explained how Aniruddha 
had been carried to the city of Sonitapura, the capital of Ba!llisura 's empire, 
and how Ba!lasura had arrested him with the niigapiisa, even though 
Aniruddha had defeated his soldiers. This news was given in detail, and the 
whole story was disclosed. Then the members of the Y adu dynasty, all of 
whom had great affection for Kr�!la, prepared to attack the city of 
Sonitapura. Practically all the leaders of the family, including Pradyumna, 
Satyaki, Gada, Samba, Sara�a, Nanda, Upananda and Bhadra, combined 
together and gathered eighteen ak§auhirti military divisions into phalanxes. 
Then they all went to Sonitapura and surrounded it with soldiers, ele-· 
phants, horses and chariots. 
Ba!lasura heard that the soldiers of the Y adu dynasty were attacking 
the whole city, tearing down various walls, gates and nearby gardens. 
Becoming very angry, he immediately ordered his soldiers, who were of 
equal caliber, to go and face them. Lord Siva was so kind to Ba!lasura that 
he personally came as the commander-in-chief of the military force, 
assisted by his heroic sons Karttikeya.and Ga!!apati. Seated on his favorite 
bull, Nandisvara, Lord Siva, led the fighting against Lord Kr��a and 
Balarama. We can simply imagine how fierce the fighting was-Lord Siva 
with his valiant sons on one side and Lord Kr�!la, the Supreme Personality 
of Godhead, and His elder brother, Sri Balaramaji, on the other. The 
fighting was so fierce that those who saw the battle were struck with 
wonder, and the hairs on their bodies stood up. Lord Siva was engaged in 
fighting directly with Lord Kr�!la, Pradyumna was engaged with Karttikeya, 
59 
60 
Kr�!la, the Supreme Personality of Godhead 
and Lord Balarama was engaged with Bapasura's commander-in-chief, 
Kumbhap�a, who was assisted by Kiipakarpa. Samba, the son of Kr�pa, 
was engaged in fighting with the son of Bapasura, and Bapasura was 
engaged in fighting with Satyaki, commander-in -chief of the Y adu dynasty. 
In this way the fighting was waged. 
News of the fighting spread all over the universe. Demigods such as Lord 
Brahma, from higher planetary systems, along with great sages and saintly 
persons, Siddhas, Carapas and Gandharvas-all being very curious to see 
the fight between Lord Siva, Lord Kr�pa and their assistants-were hovering 
over the battlefield in their airplanes. Lord Siva is called the bhilta-niitha,
being assisted by various types of powerful ghosts and denizens of the 
inferno -bhiltas, pretas, pramathas, guhyakas, fliikinis, piSiicas, kil�mii!'-flas,
vetiilas, viniiyakas, and brahma-riik§asas. (Of all kinds of ghosts, the 
brahma-riik§asas are very powerful. Briihmaras transferred to the role of 
ghosts become brahma-riik§asas.) 
The Supreme Personality of Godhead Sri Kr�pa simply drove all these 
ghosts away from the battlefield, beating them with His celebrated bow, 
Sarngadhanu. Lord Siva then began to release all his selected weapons upon 
the Personality of Godhead. Lord Sri Kr�pa, without any difficulty, 
counteracted all these weapons with counter-weapons. He counteracted 
the brahmiistra, similar to the atomic bomb, by another brahmiistra, and 
an air weapon by a mountain weapon. When Lord Siva released a particular 
weapon bringing about a violent hurricane on the battlefield, Lord Kr�pa 
presented just the opposing element, a mountain weapon which checked 
the hurricane on the spot. Similarly when Lord Siva released his weapon 
of devastating fire, Kr�pa counteracted it with torrents of rain. 
At last, when Lord Siva released his personal weapon, called piisupata­
sastra, Kr�pa immediately counteracted it by the niiriiyara-sastra. Lord 
Siva then became exasperated·in fighting with Lord Kr�pa. Kr�pa then took 
the opportunity to release His yawning weapon. When this weapon is 
released, the opposing party becomes tired, stops fighting, and begins to 
yawn. Consequently, Lord Siva became so fatigued that he refused to fight 
anymore and began to yawn. Kr�pa was now able to turn His attention 
from the attack of Lord Siva to the efforts of Bapasura, and He began to 
kill his .(>ersonal soldiers with swords and clubs. Meanwhile, Lord Kr�pa's 
son Pradyumna was fighting fiercely with Karttikeya, the commander­
in-chief of the demigods. Karttikeya was wounded, and his body was 
bleeding profusely. In this condition, he left the battlefield and, without 
fighting anymore, rode away on the back of his peacock carrier. Similarly, 
Lord Balarama was smashing Bapasura's commander-in-chief, Kumbhap�a, 
Lord Kr��a Fights with B�asura 
61 
with the strokes of his club. Kiipakar�a was also wounded in this way, and 
both he and Kumbha��a fell on the battlefield, the commander-in-chief 
being fatally wounded. Without guidance, all of Ba�asura's soldiers scat­
tered here and there. 
When Ba�asura saw that his soldiers and commanders had been defeated, 
his anger only increased. He thought it wise to stop fighting with Satyaki, 
Kr��a's commander-in-chief, and instead directly attacked Lord Kr�!la. 
Now having the opportunity to use his one thousand hands, he rushed 
towards Kr��a, simultaneously working 500 bows and 2,000 arrows. Such 
a foolish person could never measure Kr��a's strength. Immediately, with­
out any difficulty, Krwa cut each of Ba!lasura's bows into two pieces and, 
to check him from going further, made his chariot horses lay on the 
ground. The chariot then broke to pieces. After doing this, Kr��a blew His 
conchshell, Paiicajanya. 
There was a demigoddess named Kotara who was worshiped by Ba�asura, 
and their relationship was as mother and son. Mother Kotara was upset 
that Ba!lasura 's life was in danger, so she appeared on the scene. With 
naked body and scattered hair, she stood before Lord KH�a. Sri Kr��a did 
not like the sight of this naked woman, and to avoid seeing her, He turned 
His face. Ba�asura, getting this chance to escape Kr�!la's attack, left the 
battlefield. All the strings of his bows were broken, and there was no 
chariot or driver, so he had no alternative than to return to his city. He lost 
everything in the battle. 
Being greatly harassed by the arrows of Kr�!la, all the associates of Lord 
Siva, the hobgoblins and ghostly bhiitas, pretas and k§atriyas, left the 
battlefield. Lord Siva then took to his last resort. He released his greatest 
death weapon, known as Sivajvara, which destroys by excessive tempera­
ture. It is said that at the end of this creation the sun becomes twelve 
times more scorching than usual. This twelve-times-hotter temperature is 
called Sivajvara. When the Sivajvara personified was released, he had three 
�eads and three legs, and as he came toward Kr�!la it appeared that he was 
burning everything into ashes. He was so powerful that he made blazing 
fire appear in all directions, and Kr�!la observed that he was specifically 
coming toward Him. 
As there is a Sivajvara weapon, there is also a Naraya�ajvara weapon. 
Naraya�ajvara is represented by excessive cold. When there is excessive 
heat, one can somehow or other tolerate it, but when there is excessive 
cold, everything collapses. This is actually experienced by a person at the 
time of death. At the time of death, the temperature of the body first of 
all increases to l 07 degrees, and then the whole body collapses and 
62 
Kr��a, the Supreme Personality of Godhead 
immediately becomes as cold as ice. To counteract the scorching heat of 
the Sivajvara, there was 'no other weapon but Naraya�ajvara. 
When Lord Kr�!la saw that the Sivajvara had-been released by Lord Siva, 
He had no other recourse than to release Naraya!lajvara. Lord Sri Kr�!!a is 
the original Naraya�a and the controller of the Naraya�ajvara weapon. 
When the Naraya!lajvara was released, there was a great fight between the 
two jvaras. When excessive heat is counteracted by extreme cold, it is 
natural for the hot temperature to gradually reduce, and this is what 
occurred in the fight between Sivajvara and Naraya�ajvara. Gradually, 
Sivajvara's temperature diminished, and Sivajvara began to cry for help 
from Lord Siva, but Lord Siva was unable to help him in the presence of 
the Naraya!lajvara. Unable to get any help from Lord Siva, the Sivajvara 
could understand that he had no means of escape outside surrendering 
unto Naraya!la, Lord Kr�!la Himself. Lord Siva, the greatest of the demi­
gods, could not help him, what to speak of the lesser demigods, and 
therefore Sivajvara ultimately surrendered unto Kr�!la, bowing before Him 
and offering a prayer so that the Lord might be pleased and give him 
protection. 
By this incidence of the fight between the ultimate weapons of Lord 
Siva and Lord Kr�!la it is proved that if Kr�!la gives someone protection, no 
one can kill him. But if Kr�!la does not give one any protection, then no 
one can save him. Lord Siva is called Mahadeva, greatest of all demigods, 
although sometimes Lord Brahma is considered the greatest of all demi­
gods, because he can create, whereas Lord Siva can annihilate the creations 
of Brahma. But both Lord Brahma and Lord Siva act only in one capacity. 
Lord Brahma can create, and Lord Siva can annihilate, but neither of them 
can maintain. Lord Vi�!lu, however, not only maintains, but He creates, 
and annihilates also. Factually, the creation is not effected by Brahma, 
because Brahma himself is created by Lord Vi��u. Lord Siva is created, 
or born, of Brahma. The Sivajvara thus understood that without Kr�!la or 
Naraya!la, no one could help him. He therefore rightly took shelter of Lord 
Kr�!la and, with folded hands, began to pray as follows. 
"My dear Lord, I offer my respectful obeisances unto You because You 
have unlimited potencies. No one can surpass Your potencies, and thus 
You are the Lord of everyone. Generally people consider Lord Siva to be 
the most powerful personality in the material world, but Lord Siva is not 
all-powerful; You are all-powerful. This is factual. You are the original 
consciousness or knowledge. Without knowledge or consciousness, nothing 
can be powerful. A material thing might be very powerful, but without 
the touch of knowledge or consciousness it cannot act. A material machine 
Lord Kr��a Fights with Ba�asura 
63 
may be very gigantic and wonderful, but without the touch of someone 
conscious and in knowledge, the material machine is useless for all pur­
poses. My Lord, You. are complete knowledge, and there is not a pinch of 
material contamination in Your personality. Lord Siva may be a powerful 
demigod because of his specific power to annihilate the· whole creation, 
and similarly, Lord Brahm a may be very powerful because he can create 
the entire universe, but actually neither Brahma nor Lord Siva is the 
original cause of this cosmic manifestation. You are the Absolute Truth, 
the Supreme Brahman, and You are the original cause. The original cause 
of the cosmic manifestation is not the impersonal Brahman effulgence. 
That impersonal Brahman effulgence is resting on Your personality. As is 
confirmed in the Bhagavad-gita, the cause of the impersonal Brahman is 
Lord Kr��a. This Brahman effulgence is likened to the sunshine which 
emanates from the sun globe. Therefore, impersonal Brahman is not the 
ultimate cause. The ultimate cause of everything is the supreme eternal 
form of Kr��a. All material actions and reactions are taking place in the 
impersonal Brahman, but in the personal Brahman, the eternal form of 
Krwa, there is no action and reaction. My Lord, Your body is therefore 
completely 
peaceful, 
completely blissful and is devoid of material 
contamination. 
"In the material body there are actions and reactions of the three 
modes of material nature. The time factor is the most important element 
and is above all others, because the material manifestation is effected by 
time agitation. Thus natural phenomena come into existence, and as soon 
as there is the appearance of phenomena, fruitive activities are visible. As 
the result of these fruitive activities, a living entity takes his form. He 
acquires a particular type of nature which is packed up in a subtle body 
and gross body formed by the life air, the ego, the ten sense organs, the 
mind and the five gross elements: These then create the type of body which 
later becomes the root or cause of various other bodies, which are acquired 
one after another by the transmigration of the soul. All these phenomenal 
manifestations are the combined actions of Your material energy. Unaf­
fected by the action and reaction of different elements, You are the cause 
of this external energy, and because You are transcendental to such 
compulsions of material energy, You are the supreme tranquility. You are 
the last word in freedom from material contamination. I am therefore 
taking shelter at Your lotus feet, giving up all other shelter. 
"My dear Lord, Your appearance as the son of Vasudeva in Your role as 
a human being is one of the pastimes of Your complete freedom. To 
benefit Your devotees and to vanquish the nondevotees, You appear in 
64 
Kr�pa, the Supreme Personality of Godhead 
multi-incarnations. All such incarnations descend in fulfillment of Your 
promise in the Bhagavad-gitii that You appear as soon as there are 
discrepancies in the system of progressive life. When there are disturbances 
by irregular principles, my dear Lord, You appear by Your internal 
potency. Your main business is to protect and maintain the demigods and 
spiritually inclined persons and maintain the standard of material law and 
order. Simultaneous to the maintenance of such law and order, Your 
violence to the miscreants and demons is quite befitting. This is not the 
first time You have incarnated; it is to be understood that You have done 
so many, many times before. 
"My dear Lord, I beg to submit that I have been very greatly chastised 
by the release of Your Naraya!lajvara. It is certainly very cooling, yet at 
the same time very severely dangerous and unbearable for all of us. My 
dear Lord, as long as one is forgetful of Kr�!la consciousness, driven by the 
spell of material desires and ignorant of the ultimate shelter at Your lotus 
feet, one who has accepted this material body becomes disturbed by the 
three miserable conditions of material nature. Because one does riot sur­
render unto You, he therefore continues to suffer perpetually." 
After hearing the Sivajvara, Lord Kr�!la replied, "0 three-headed one, I 
am pleased with your statement. Be assured there is no more suffering for 
you from the Naraya!lajvara. Not only are you now free from fear of 
Naraya!lajvara, but- anyone in the future who simply recollects this fight 
between Sivajvara and Naraya!lajvara will also be freed from all kinds of 
fearfulness." After hearing the Supreme Personality of Godhead, the 
Sivajvara offered his respectful obeisances unto His lotus feet and left. 
In the meantime Ba!lasura somehow or other recovered from his setbacks 
and, with rejuvenated energy, returned to fight. This time Ba!lasura 
appeared before Lord Krwa, who was seated on His chariot, with different 
kinds of weapons in his one thousand hands. Ba!lasura was very much 
agitated. He began to splash his different weapons, like torrents of rain, 
upon the body of Lord Kr�!la. When Lord Kr�!la saw the weapons of 
Ba!lasura coming at Him, like water coming out of a strainer, He took His 
sharp-edged Sudarsana disc and began to cut off the demon's one thou­
sand hands one after another, just as a gardener trims the twigs of a tree 
with sharp cutters. When Lord Siva saw that his devotee Ba!lasura could 
not be saved even in his presence, he came to his senses and personally 
came before Lord Kr�!la and began to pacify Him by offering the following 
prayers. 
Lord Siva said, "My dear Lord, You are the worshipable object of the 
Vedic hymns. One who does not know You considers the impersonal 
Lord Kr��a Fights with Ba�asura 
65 
�rahmajyoti to be the ultimate Supreme Absolute Truth, without any 
knowledge that You are existing behind Your spiritual effulgence in Your 
eternal abode. My dear Lord, You are therefore called Parambrahman. 
This word, Parambrahman, has been used in the Bhagavad-gitii to identify 
You. Saintly persons who have completely cleansed their hearts of all 
material contamination can realize Your transcendental form, although 
You are all-pervading like the sky, unaffected by any material thing. Only 
the devotees can realize You, and no one else. In the impersonalists' 
conception of Your supreme existence, the sky is just like Your navel, the 
fire is Your mouth, and the water is Your semina. The heavenly planets are 
Your head, all the directions are Your ears, the Urvi planet is Your lotus 
feet, the moon is Your mind, and the sun is Your eye. As far as I am 
concerned, I act as Your ego. The ocean is Your abdomen, and the King of 
heaven, lndra, is Your arm. Trees and plants are the hairs of Your body, 
the cloud is the hair on Your head, and Lord Brahma is Your intelligence. 
All the great progenitors, 
known as Prajapatis, 
are Your symbolic 
representatives. And religion is ·Your heart. The impersonal feature of 
Your supreme body is conceived of in this way, but You are ultimately the 
Supreme Person. The impersonal feature of Your supreme body is only a 
small expansion of Your energy. You are likened to the original fire, and 
the exp�nsions are Your light and heat." 
Lord Siva continued: "My dear Lord, although You are manifested 
universally, different parts of the universe are the different parts of Your 
body, and by Your inconceivable potency You can simultaneously be 
both localized and universal. In the Brahma-samhitii we also find it stated 
that although You always remain in Your abode, Goloka Vrndavana, You 
are nevertheless present everywhere. As stated in the Bhagavad-gitii, You 
appear to protect the devotees, which indicates good fortune for all the 
universe. All of the demigods are directing different affairs of the universe 
by Your grace only. Thus the seven upper planetary systems are being 
maintained by Your grace. At the end of this creation, all manifestations 
of Your energies, whether in the shape of demigods, human beings or 
lower animals, enter into You, and all immediate and remote causes of 
cosmic manifestation rest in You without distinctive features of existence. 
Ultimately, there is no possibility of distinction between Yourself and any 
other thing on an equal level with You or subordinate to You. You are 
simultaneously the cause of this cosmic manifestation and its ingredients 
as well. You are the Supreme Whole, one without a second. In the pheno­
menal manifestation there are three stages: the stage of consciousness, the 
stage of semiconsciousness in dreaming, and the stage of unconsciousness. 
66 
Kr��a, the Supreme Personality of Godhead 
But Your Lordship is transcendental to all these different material stages 
of existence. You exist, therefore, in a fourth dimension, and Your 
appearance and disappearance do not depend on anything beyond Your­
self. You are the supreme cause of everything, but for Yourself there is no 
cause. You Yourself cause Your own appearance and disappearance. 
Despite Your transcendental position, my Lord, in order to show Your 
six opulences and advertise Your transcendental qualities, You have 
appeared in Your different incarnations-fish, tortoise, boar, Nrsimha, 
Kesava, etc.-by Your personal manifestation; and You have appeared as 
different living entities by Your separated manifestations. By Your internal 
potency, You appear as the different incarnations of Vi��u, and by Your 
external potency You appear as the phenomenal world. 
"Because it is a cloudy day to the common man's eyes, the sun appears 
to be covered. But the fact is that because the sunshine creates the cloud, 
even though the whole sky is cloudy, the sun can never actually be 
covered. Similarly, the less intelligent class of men claims that there is no 
God, but when the manifestation of different living entities and their 
activities is visible, enlightened persons see You present in every atom and 
through the via media of Your external and marginal energies. Your unlimi­
ted potential activities are experienced by the most enlightened devotees, 
but those who are bewildered by the spell of Your external energy identify 
themselves with this material world and become attached to society, friend­
ship and love. Thus they embrace the threefold miseries of material exist­
ence and are subjected to the dualities of pain and pleasure. They are some­
times drowned in the ocean of attachment and sometimes taken out of it. 
"My dear Lord, only by Your mercy and grace can the living entity get 
the human form of life, which is a chance to get out of the miserable 
condition of material existence. However, a person who possesses a human 
body but who cannot bring the senses under control is carried away by the 
waves of sensual enjoyment. As such, he cannot take shelter of Your lotus 
feet and thus engage in Your devotional service. The life of such a person 
is very unfortunate, and anyone living such a life of darkness is certainly 
cheating himself and thus cheating others also. Therefore, human society 
without Kr��a consciousness is a society of cheaters and the cheated. 
"My Lord, You are actually the dearmost Supersoul of all living entities 
and the supreme controller of everything. The human being who is always 
illusioned is afraid of ultimate death. A man who is simply attached to 
sensual enjoyment voluntarily accepts the miserable material existence and 
thus wanders after the will-o'-the-wisp of sense pleasure. He is certainly the 
most foolsih man, for he drinks poison and puts aside the nectar. My dear 
Lord Kr�!ia Fights with B�asura 
67 
Lord, all the demigods, including myself and Lord Brahma, as well as great 
saintly persons and sages whotbave cleansed their hearts of this material 
attachment, have, by Your grace, wholeheartedly taken shelter of Your 
lotus feet. We have all taken shelter of You, because we have accepted 
You as the Supreme Lord and the dearmost life and soul of all of us. You 
are the original cause of this cosmic manifestation, You are its supreme 
maintainer, and You are the cause of its dissolution also. You are equal 
to everyone, the most peaceful supreme friend of every living entity. You 
are the supreme worshipahle object for every one of us. My dear Lord, let 
us always be engaged in Your transcendental loving service so that we may 
get free from this material entanglement. 
"Lastly, my Lord, I may inform You that this Ba!lasura is very dear to 
me. He has rendered very valuable service unto me; therefore I want to see 
him always happy. Being pleased with him, I have given him the assurance 
of safety. I pray to You, my Lord, that as You were pleased upon his 
forefathers King Prahlada and Bali Maharaja, You will also be pleased 
with him." 
After hearing Lord Siva's prayer, Lord Kr�!la addressed him also as 
lord and said, "My dear Lord Siva, I accept your statements, and your 
desire for Ba�asura is also accepted by Me. I know that this Ba�asura is the 
son of Bali Maharaja, and as such I cannot kill him because that is My 
promise. I gave a benediction to King Prahlada that all the demons who 
would appear in his family would never be killed by Me. Therefore, with­
out killing this Ba�asura, I have simply cut off his arms to deprive him of 
his false prestige. The large number of soldiers which he was maintaining 
became a burden on this earth, and I have killed them all in order to 
minimize the burden. Now he has four remaining arms, and he will remain 
immortal, without being affected by the material pains and pleasures. 
I know that he is one of the chief devotees of your lordship, so you c�m 
now rest assured that henceforward he need have no fear from anything." 
When Ba�asura was benedicted by Lord K��!Ja in this way, he came 
before the Lord and bowed down before Him, touching his head to the 
earth. He immediately arranged to bring Aniruddha along with his daughter 
U�a, seated on a nice chariot, and presented them before Lord Kr��a. 
After this, Lord Kr��a took charge of Aniruddha and U�a, who had become 
very opulent materially because of the blessings of Lord Siva. Thus, 
keeping forward a division of one ak§auhir-i of soldiers, Kr��a began to 
proceed toward Dvaraka. In the meantime, all the people at Dvaraka, 
having 
received 
the 
news 
that 
Lord 
Kr��a 
was 
returning 
with 
Aniruddha and U�a in great opulence, decorated every corner of the city 
68 
Kr��a, The Supreme Personlaity of Godhead 
with flags, festoons and garlands. All the big roads and crossings were 
carefully cleansed and sprinkled with sandalwood pulp mixed with water. 
Everywhere there was the flavor of sandalwood. All the citizens, ac­
companied by their friends and relatives, welcomed Lord Kr��a with great 
pomp and jubilation. At that time, there was a tumultuous vibration of 
conchshells and drums and bugles to receive the Lord. In this way the 
Supreme Personality of Godhead Kr��a entered His capital, Dvaraka. 
Sukadeva Gosvami assured King Parik�it that the narration of the fight 
between Lord Siva and Lord Kr�tta is not at all inauspicious like ordinary 
fights. On the contrary, if one remembers the narration of this fight 
between Lord Kr��a and Lord Siva in the morning and takes pleasure in the 
victory of Lord Kr��a, he will never experience defeat anywhere in his 
struggle of life. 
This episode of Ba�asura's fighting with Kr��a and later on being 
saved by the grace of Lord Siva is confirmation of the statement in the 
Bhagavad-gitii that the worshipers of demigods cannot achieve any benedic­
tion without its being sanctioned by the Supreme Lord, Kr��a. Here, in 
this narration, we find that although Ba�asura was a great devotee of Lord 
Siva, when he f�ced death by Kr��a, Lord Siva was not able to save him. 
But Lord Siva appealed to KH�a to save his devotee, and it was thus 
sanctioned by the Lord. This is the position of Lord Kr�tta. The exact 
words used in this connection in the Bhagavad-gitii are mayaiva vihitiin hi 
tiin. This means that without the sanction of the Supreme Lord, no 
demigod can award any benediction to the worshiper. 
Thus ends the Bhaktivedanta purport of the Second Volume, Eighth 
Chapter, of Kr�!J.a, Lord Knew Fights with Bariisura." 
9 I The Story of King N rga 
Once the family. members of Lord Kr�!J.a, such as Samba, Pradyumna, 
Carubhanu and Gada, all princes of the Y adu dynasty, went for a long 
picnic in the forest near Dvaraka. In the course of their excursion, all of 
them became thirsty, and so they began to try to find out where water was­
available in the forest. When they approached a well, they found that ther-e 
was rio water in it, but on the contrary, within the well was a wonderful 
living entity. It was a large lizard, and all of them became astonished to see 
such a wonderful animal. They could understand that the animal was 
trapped and could riot escape by its own effort, so out of compassion they 
tried to take the large lizard out of the well. Unfortunately, they could not 
get the lizard out, even though they tried to do so in many ways. 
When the princes returned home, their story was narrated before Lord 
Kr�!J.a. Lord Kr�!la is the friend of all living entities. Therefore, after 
hearing the appeal from His sons, He personally went to the well and easily 
got the great lizard out simply by extending His left hand. Immediately 
upon being touched by the hand of Lord Kr�!J.a, that great lizard gave up 
its former shape and appeared as a beautiful demigod, an inhabitant of the 
heavenly planets. His bodily complexion glittered like molten gold. He was 
decorated with fine garments, and he wore costly ornaments around his 
neck. 
How the demigod had been obliged to accept the body of a lizard was 
not a secret to Lord Krsna, but still, for others' information, the Lord 
. .. 
inquired, "My dear fortunate demigod, now I see that your body is so 
beautiful and lustrous. Who are you? We can guess that you are one of the 
best demigods in the heavenly planets. All good fortune to you. I think 
that you are not meant to be in this situation. It must be due to the 
results of your past activities that you have been put into the species of 
., lizard life. Still, I want to hear from you how you were put in this
69 
70 
Kr��a, the Supreme Personality of Godhead 
position. If you think that you can disclose this secret, then please tell us 
your identity." 
Actually this large lizard was King Nrga, and when he was questioned by 
the Supreme Personality of Godhead he immediately bowed down before 
the Lord, touching to the ground the helmet on his head, which was as 
dazzling as the sunshine. In this way, he first of all offered his respectful 
obeisances unto the Supreme Lord. He then said, "My dear Lord, I am the 
son of King Ilu]vaku, and am King Nrga. If you have ever taken account of 
all charitably disposed men, I am sure that You must have heard my name. 
My Lord, You are the witness. You are aware of every bit of work done by 
the living entities-past, present and future. Nothing can be hidden from 
Your eternal cognizance. Still, You have ordered me to explain my history, 
and I shall therefore narrate the full story." 
King Nrga proceeded to narrate the history of his degradation, caused 
by his karma-kii!f-pa activities. He was very charitably disposed and had 
given away so many cows that he said the number was equal to the amount 
of dust on the earth, the stars in the sky, and the rainfall. According to the 
Vedic titualistic ceremonies, a man who is charitably disposed is com­
manded to give cows to the briihma!f-aS. From King Nrga's statement, it 
appears that he followed this principle earnestly; however, as a result of a 
slight discrepancy in his action, he was forced to take birth as a lizard. 
Therefore it is recommended by the Lord in the Bhagavad-gitii that one 
who is charitably disposed and desires to derive the benefit of his charity 
should offer his gifts to please Kr�tJ.a. To give in charity means to perform 
pious activities. As a result of pious activities one may be elevated to the 
higher planetary systems; but promotion to the heavenly planets is no 
guarantee that one will never fall down. Rather, from the example of King 
Nrga, it is definitely proved that fruitive activities, even if they are very 
pious, cannot give us eternal blissful life. As stated in the Bhagavad-gitii, 
the result of work, either pious or impious, is sure to bind a man unless it 
is discharged as yajiia on behalf of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. 
King Nrga continued to say that the cows given in charity were not 
ordinary cows. Each one was very young and had given birth to only one 
calf. They were full of milk, very peaceful and healthy. All the cows were 
purchased with money that had been earned legally. Furthermore, their 
horns were gold-plated, their hooves were bedecked with silver plates, and 
they were covered with silken wrappers which were embroidered with 
pearls and necklaces. He stated that these valuably decorated cows were 
not given to any worthless person, but were distributed to the first-class 
briihma!f-as, whom he had also decorated with nice garments and gold 
The Story of King N rga 
71 
ornaments. The brahmaflaS were well qualified, none of them were rich, 
and their family members were always in want for the necessities of life. 
A real brahma!la never hoards money for a luxurious life, like the k�atriyas 
or the vaisyas, but always keeps himself in a poverty -stricken condition, 
knowing that money diverts the mind to materialistic ways of life. To live 
in this way is the vow of a qualified brahmafla, and all of these brahma!las 
were well situated in that exalted vow. They were well learned in Vedic 
knowledge. They executed the required austerities and penances in their 
lives, and were liberal, meeting the standard of qualified brahmaflaS. They 
were equally friendly to everyone; above all, they were young and quite 
fit to act as qualified brahmaflaS. Besides the cows, they were also given 
land, gold, houses, horses and elephants. Those who were not married were 
given wives, maidservants, grains, silver, utensils, garments, jewels, house­
hold furniture, chariots, etc. This charity was nicely performed as a sacri­
fice according to the Vedic rituals. The King also stated that not only had 
he bestowed gifts on the brahma£laS, but he had performed other pious 
activities, such as digging a well, planting trees on the roadside and in­
stalling ponds on the highways. 
The King continued, "In spite of all this, unfortunately one of the 
brahma£la's cows chanced to enter amongst my other cows. Not knowing 
this, I again gave it in charity to another brahmafla. As the cow was being 
taken away by the brahma£la, its former master claimed it as his own, 
stating, 'This cow was formerly given to me, so how is it that you are 
taking it away?' Thus there was arguing and fighting between the two 
brahma£las, and they came before me and charged that I had taken back a 
cow that I had previously given in charity." To give something to someone 
and then to take it away is considered a great sin, especially in dealing with 
a brahmafla. When both the brahma£laS charged the King with the same 
complaint, he was simply puzzled as to how it had happened. Thereafter, 
with great humility' the King offered each of them one hundred thousand 
cows in exchange for the one cow that was causing the fight between them. 
He prayed to them that he was their servant and that there had been some 
mistake. Thus, in order to rectify it, he prayed that they would be very 
kind upon him and accept his offer in exchange for the cow. The King 
fervently appealed to the brahma£laS not to cause his downfall into hell 
because of this mistake. A brahma!la's property is called brahma-sva, and 
according to Manu's law, it cannot be acquired even by the government. 
Both brahma£laS insisted that the cow was theirs and could not be taken 
back under any condition; neither of them agreed to exchange it for the 
one hundred thousand cows. Thus disagreeing with the King's proposal, 
72 
Kr��a, the Supreme Personality of Godhead 
both briihmartas left the palace in anger, thinking that their lawful position 
had been usurped. 
After this incident, when the time came for the King to give up his 
body, he was taken before Yamaraja, the superintendent of death. 
Y amaraja asked him whether he wanted to first enjoy the results of his 
pious activities or first suffer the results of his impious activities. Y amaraja 
. also hinted that since the King had executed so many pious activities and 
charities, the limit of Nrga's enjoyment would be unknown to him. There 
was practically no end to the King's material happiness, but in spite of this 
hint, he was bewildered. He decided to first suffer the results of his 
impious activities and then to accept the results of his pious activities; 
therefore Y amaraja immediately turned him into a lizard. 
King N rga had remained in a well as a big lizard for a very long time. He 
told Lord Kr��a: "In spite of being put into that degraded condition of 
life, I simply thought of You, my dear Lord, and my memory was never 
vanquished." It appears from these statements of King N rga that persons 
who follow the principles of fruitive activities and derive some material 
benefits are not very intelligent. Being given the choice by the super­
intendent of death, Yamaraja, King Nrga could have first accepted the 
results of his pious activities. Instead he thought it would be better to 
first receive the effects of his impious activities and then enjoy the effects 
of his pious activities without disturbance. On the whole, he had not 
developed Kr��a consciousness. The Kr��a conscious person develops love 
of God, Kr��a, not love for pious or impious activities; therefore he is not 
subjected to the results of such action. As stated in the Brahma-sarhhitii, a 
devotee, by the grace of the Lord, does not become subjected to the 
resultant reactions of fruitive activities. 
Somehow or other, as a result of his pious activities, King Nrga had 
aspired to see the Lord. He continued to say: "My dear Lord, I had a great 
desire that someday I might be able to see You personally. I think that my 
tendency to perform ritualistic and charitable activities, combined with 
this great desire to see You personally, has enabled me to retain the 
memory of who I was in my former life, even though I became a lizard." 
(Such a person, who remembers his past life, is called jiiti-smara.) "My 
dear Lord, You are the Supersoul seated in everyone's heart. There are 
many great mystic yogis who have eyes to see You through the Vedg.s and 
Upani§ads. In order tp achieve the elevated position of being equal in 
quality with You, they always meditate on You within their hearts. Al­
though such exalted saintly persons may see You constantly within their 
hearts, they still cannot see You eye to eye; therefore I am very much 
The Story of King N rga 
73 
surprised that I am able to see You personally. I know that I was engaged 
in so many. activities, especially as a king. Although I was in the midst of 
luxury and opulence and was subjected to so much of the happiness and 
misery of material existence, I am so fortunate to be seeing You personally. 
As far as I know, when one becomes liberated from material existence, he 
can see You in this way." 
When King Nrga elected to receive the results of his impious activities, 
he was given the body of a lizard because of the mistake in his pious 
activities; thus he could not be directly converted to a higher status of life 
like a great demigod. However, along with his pious activities, he thought 
of Kr��a, so he was quickly released from the body of a lizard and given 
the body of a demigod. By worshiping the Supreme Lord, those who desire 
material opulences are given the bodies of powerful demigods. Sometimes 
these demigods can see the Supreme Personality of Godhead eye to eye, 
but they are still not yet eligible to enter into the spiritual kingdom, the 
V aiku�tha planets. However, if the demigods continue to become devotees 
of the Lord, the next chance they get they will enter into the Vaiku�t�a 
planets. 
Having attained the body of a demigod, King Nrga, continuing to re­
member everything, said, "My dear Lord, You are the Supreme Lord and 
are worshiped by all the demigods. You are not one of the living entities, 
but You are the Supreme Person, Puru�ottama. You are the source of all 
happiness to all living entities; therefore You are known as Govinda. You 
are the Lord of those living entities who have accepted a material body and 
those who have not yet accepted a material body." (Among the living 
entities who have not accepted a material body are those who are hovering 
in the material world as evil spirits or living in the ghostly atmosphere. 
However, those who live in the spiritual kingdom, the V aiku�thalokas, 
have bodies that are not made of material elements.) "You are, my Lord, 
infallible. You are the Supreme, the purest of all living entities. You are 
living in everyone's heart. You are the shelter of all living entities, 
Naraya�a. Being seated in the heart of all living entities, You are the 
supreme director of everyone's sensual activities; therefore, You are called 
Hr�ikesa. 
"My dear Supreme Lord Kr��a, because You have given me this body of 
a demigod, I will have to go to some heavenly planet; so I am taking this 
opportunity to beg for Your mercy, that I may have the benediction of 
never forgetting Your lotus feet, no matter to which form of life or planet 
I may be transferred. You are all-pervading, present everywhere as cause 
and effect. You are the cause of all causes, and Your potency and power 
...1
· 
74 
Kr��a, the Supreme Personality of Godhead 
are unlimited. You are the Absolute Truth, the Supreme Personality of 
Godhead and the Supreme Brahman. I therefore offer my respectful 
obeisances unto You again and again. My dear Lord, Your body is full of 
transcendental bliss and knowledge, and You are eternal. You are the 
master of all mystic powers; therefore You are known as Y oge8vara. Kindly 
accept me as insignificant dust at Your lotus feet." 
Before entering the heavenly planets, King Nrga circumambulated the 
Lord. He touched his helmet to the lotus feet of the Lord and bowed 
before Him. Seeing the airplane from the heavenly planets present before 
him, he was given permission by the Lord to board it. After the departure 
of King Nrga, Lord Kr��a expressed His appreciation for the King's devo­
tion to the briihmartas as well as his charitable disposition and his perform­
ance of Vedic rituals. Therefore, it is recommended that if one cannot 
directly become a devotee of the Lord, one should follow the Vedic prin­
ciples of life. This will enable him, one day, to see the Lord by being 
promoted either directly to the spiritual kingdom or indirectly to the 
heavenly kingdom, where he has hope of being transferred to the spiritual 
planets. 
At this time, Lord Kr��a was present among His relatives who were 
members of the k§atriya class. To teach them through the exemplary 
character of King Nrga, He said: "Even though a k§atriya king may be as 
powerful as fire, it is not possible for him to usurp the property of a 
briihmarta and utilize it for his own purpose. If this is so, how can ordinary 
kings, who falsely think of themselves as the most powerful beings within 
the material world, usurp a briihmarta's property? I do not think that 
taking poison is as dangerous as taking a briihmarta's property. For ordinary 
poison there is treatment-one can be relieved from its effects; but if one 
drinks the poison of taking a briihmarta's property, there is no remedy for 
the mistake. The perfect example was King Nrga. He was very powerful 
and very pious, but due to the small mistake of unknowingly usurping a 
briihmarta's cow, he was condemned to the abominable life of a lizard. 
Ordinary poison affects only those who drink it, and ordinary fire can be 
extinguished simply by pouring water on it; but the ararti fire ignited by 
the spiritual potency of a briihmarta can burn to ashes the whole family of 
a person who provokes such a briihmarta." (Formerly, the briihmartas used 
to ignite the fire of sacrifice not with matches or any other external fire 
but with their powerful mantras, called ararti.) "If someone even touches 
a briihmarta's property, he is ruined for three generations. However, if a 
briihmarta 's property is forcibly taken away, the taker's family for ten 
generations before him and for ten generations after him will become 
The Story of King N rga 
75 
subject to ruination. On the other hand, if someone becomes a V ai�!lava or 
devotee of the Lord, ten generations of his family before his birth and ten 
generations after will become liberated." 
Lord Kr�!la continued: "If some foolish king who is puffed up by his 
wealth, prestige and power wants to usurp a briihma!'a's property, it 
should be understood that such a king is clearing his path to hell; he does 
not know how much he has to suffer for such unwise action. If someone 
takes away the property of a very liberal briihma!'a who is encumbered by 
a large dependent family, then such a usurper is put into the hell known as 
Kumbhipaka; not only is he put into this hell, but his family members also 
have to accept such a miserable condition of life. A person who takes away 
property which has either been awarded to a briihma!'a or given away by 
him is condemned to live for at least 60,000 years as miserably as an insect 
in stool. Therefore I instruct you, all My boys and relatives present here, 
do not, even by mistake, take the possession of a briihma!'a and thereby 
pollute Your whole family. If someone even wishes to possess such 
property, let alone attempts to take it away by force, the duration of his 
life will be reduced. He will be defeated by his enemies, and after being 
bereft of his royal position, when he gives up his body he will become a 
serpent. A serpent gives trouble to all other living entities. My dear boys 
and relatives, I therefore advise you that even if a briihma!'a becomes angry 
with you and calls you by ill names or cuts you, still you should not retali­
ate. On the contrary, you should smile, tolerate him and offer your respects 
to the briihmara. You know very well that even I Myself offer My obei­
sances to the briihmaras with great respect three times daily. You should 
therefore follow My instruction and example. I shall not forgive anyone 
who does not follow them, and I shall punish him. You should learn from 
the example of King Nrga that even if someone unknowingly usurps the 
property of a briihmaf'a, he is put into a miserable condition of life." 
Thus Lord Kr�!la, who is always engaged in purifying the conditioned 
living entities, gave instruction not only to His family members and the 
inhabitants of Dvaraka, but to all the members of human society. After this 
the Lord entered His palace. 
Thus ends the Bhaktivedanta purport of the Second Volume, Ninth 
Chapter, of Kr�!la, 
"The Story of King Nrga." 
10 I Lord Balarama Visits Vrndavana 
• 
Lord Balarama became very anxious to see His father and mother, 
Maharaja Nanda and Y a.Soda. Therefore He started for Vrndavana on a 
chariot with great enthusiasm. The inhabitants of V rndavana had been 
anxious to see· Kr��a and Balarama for a very long time. When Lord 
Balarama returned to V rndavana, all the cowherd boys and the go pis had 
grown up; but still, on His arrival, they all embraced Him, and Balarama 
embraced them in reciprocation. After this He came before Maharaja 
Nanda and Yasoda and offered His respectful obeisances unto them. In 
response, mother Yasoda and Nanda Maharaja offered their blessings unto 
Him. They addressed Him as J agadisvara, or the Lord of the universe who 
maintains everyone. The reason for this was that both Kr��a and Balarama 
maintain all living entities, and yet Nanda and Yasoda were put into such 
difficulties on account of Their absence. Feeling like this, they embraced 
Balarama and, seating Him on their laps, began their perpetual crying, 
wetting Balarama with their tears. Lord Balarama then offered His respect­
ful obeisances to the elderly cowherd men and accepted the obeisances 
of the younger cowherd men. Thus, according to their different ages and 
relationships, Lord Balarama exchanged feelings of friendship with them. 
He shook hands with those who were His equals in age and friendship, and 
with loud laughing embraced each one of them. 
After being received by the cowherd men and boys, the gopis, and King 
N anda and Y asoda, Lord Balarama sat down, feeling satisfied, and they all 
surrounded Him. First Lord Balarama inquired from them about their 
welfare, and then, not having seen Him for such a long time, they began 
to ask Him different questions. The inhabitants of V rndavana had sacrificed 
everything for Kr��a, simply being captivated by the lotus eyes of the 
Lord. Because of their great desire to love Kr��a, they never desired 
anything like elevation to the heavenly planets or merging into the 
effulgence of Brahman to become one with the Absolute Truth. They were 
76 
Lord Balarama Visits Vrndavana 
77 
not even interested in enjoying a life of opulence, but were satisfied in 
living a simple life in the village as cowherd men. They were always 
absorbed in thoughts of Kr�!la and did not desire any personal benefits, 
and they were all so much in love with Him that in His absence their 
voices faltered when they began to inquire from Balaramaji. 
First Nanda Maharaja and Yasodamayi inquired, "My dear Balarama, 
are our friends like Vasudeva and others in the family doing well? Now 
You and Kr�!ia are grown-up married men with children. In the happiness 
of family life, do You sometimes remember Your poor father and mother, 
Nanda Maharaja and Yasodadevi? It is very good news that the most 
sinful King Kamsa has been killed by You and that our friends like 
Vasudeva and the others, who had been harrassed by him, have now been 
relieved. It is also very good news that both You and Kr�!ia defeated 
J arasandha and Kalayavana, who now is dead, and that You are now 
living in a fortified residence in Dvaraka." 
When the gopis arrived, Lord Balarama glanced over them with loving 
eyes. Being overjoyed, the gopis, who had so long been mortified on 
account of Krwa's and Balarama's absence, began to ask about the welfare 
of the two brothers. They specifically asked Balarama whether Kr�!la was 
enjoying His life surrounded by the enlightened women of Dvaraka Puri. 
"Does He sometimes remember His father Nanda and His mother Yasoda 
and the other friends with whom He so intimately behaved while He was 
in Vrndavana? Does Krwa have any plans to come here to see His 
mother Y asoda, and does He remember us gopis who are now pitiably 
bereft of His company? Kr�!la might have forgotten us in the midst of the 
cultured women of Dvaraka, but as far as we are concerned, we are still 
remembering Him by collecting flowers and sewing them into garlands. 
When He does not come, however, we simply pass our time by crying. If 
only He would come here and accept these garlands that we have made. 
Dear Lord Balarama, descendant of Dasarha, You know that we would 
give up everything for Kr�!la's friendship. Even in great distress one cannot 
give up the connection of family members, but although it might be 
impossible for others, we gave up our fathers, mothers, sisters and relatives 
without caring at all about our renunciation. Then, all of a sudden, Kr�!la 
renounced us and went away. He broke off our intimate relationship 
without any serious consideration and left for a foreign country. But He 
was so clever and cunning that He manufactured very nice words. He said, 
'My dear gopis, please do not worry. The service that you have rendered 
Me is impossible for Me to repay.' After all, we are women, so how could 
we disbelieve Him? Now we can understand that His sweet words were 
simply for cheating us." 
78 
Kr��a, the Supreme Personality of Godhead 
Another go pi, protesting Kr��a 's absence from V rndavana, began to say: 
"My dear Balaramaji, we are of course village girls, so Kr��a could cheat us 
in that way, but what about the women of Dvaraka? Don't think they are 
as foolish as we are! We village women might be misled by Kr��a, but the 
women in the city of Dvaraka are very clever and intelligent. Therefore I 
would be surprised if such city women could be misled by Kr��a and could 
believe His words." 
Then another gopi began to speak. "My dear friend," she said, "Kr��a 
is very clever in using words. No one can compete with Him in that art. 
He can manufacture such colorful words and talk so sweetly that the 
heart of any woman would be misled. Besides that, He has perfected the 
art of smiling very attractively, and by seeing His smile women become 
mad after Him and would give themselves to Him without any hesitation." 
Another gopi, after hearing this, said, "My dear friends, what is the use 
in talking about Kr��a? If you are at all interested in passing away time 
by talking, let us talk on some subject other than Him. If cruel Kr��a can 
pass His time without us, why can't we pass our time withouf Kr��a? 
Of course, Kr��a is passing His days very happily without us, but the 
difference is that we cannot pass our days very happily without Him." 
When the gopis were talking in this way, their feelings for Kr��a became 
more and more intensified, and they were experiencing Kr��a 's smiling, 
Krsna's words of love, Krsna's attractive features, Krsna's characteristics 
. 
. .

and Kr��a's embraces. By the force of their ecstatic feelings, it appeared 
to them that Kr��a was personally present and dancing before them. 
Because of their sweet remembrance of Kr��a, they could not check their 
tears, and they began to cry without consideration. 
Lord Balarama could, of course, understand the ecstatic feelings of the 
gopis, and therefore He wanted to pacify them. He was expert in present­
ing an appeal, and thus, treating the gopis very respectfully, He began to 
narrate the stories of Kr��a so tactfully that the gopis became satisfied. 
In order to keep the go pis in V rndavana satisfied, Lord Balarama stayed 
there continually for two months, namely the months of Caitra (March­
April) and Vaisakha (April-May). For those two months He kept Himself 
among the gopis, and He passed every night with them in the forest of 
V rndavana in order to satisfy their desire for conjugal love. Thus Balarama 
also enjoyed the rasa dance with the gopis during those two months. 
Since the season was springtime, the breeze on the bank of the Yamuna 
was blowing very mildly, carrying the aroma of different flowers, especially 
of the flower known as kaumudi. Moonlight filled the sky and spread 
everywhere, and thus the banks of the Yam una appeared to be very bright 
Lord Balarama Visits V rndavana 
79 
and pleasing, and Lord Balarama enjoyed the company of the go pis there. 
The demigod known as Varu:tla. sent his daughter Varu:tli in the form of 
liquid honey oozing from the hollows of the trees. Because of this honey 
the whole forest became aromatic, and the sweet aroma of the liquid 
honey, Varu:tli, captivated Balaramaji. Balaramaji and all the gopis became 
very much attracted by the taste of Varu:tli, and all of them drank it 
together. While drinking this natural beverage, Varu:tli, all the gopis chanted 
the glories of Lord Balarama, and Lord Balarama felt very happy, as if He 
had become intoxicated by drinking that Varu:tli beverage. His eyes rolled 
in a pleasing attitude. He was decorated with long garlands of forest 
flowers, and the whole situation appeared to he a great function of 
happiness because of this transcendental bliss. Lord Balarama smiled 
beautifully, and the drops of perspiration decorating His face appeared 
to he soothing morning dew. 
While Balarama was in that happy mood, He desired to enjoy the 
company of the gopis in the water of the Yam una. Therefore He called 
Yam una to come nearby. But Yam una neglected the order of Balaramaji, 
considering Him to he intoxicated. Lord Balarama became very much 
displeased at Yamuna's neglecting His order. He immediately wanted to 
scratch the land near the river with His plowshare. Lord Balarama has two 
weapons, a plow and a club, and He takes service from them when they are 
required. This time He wanted to bring the Yamuna by force, and He took 
the help of His plow. He wanted to punish Yam una because she did not 
come in obedience to His order. He addressed Yamuna: "You wretched 
river! You did not care for My order. Now I shall teach you a lesson! You 
did not come to Me voluntarily. Now with the help of My plow I shall 
force you to come. I shall divide you into hundreds of scattered streams!" 
When Yamuna was threatened like this, she became greatly afraid of the 
power of Balarama and immediately came in person, falling at His lotus 
feet and praying thus: "My dear Balarama, You are the most powerful 
personality, and You are pleasing to everyone. Unfortunately, I forgot 
Your glorious, exalted position, hut now I have come to my senses, and I
remember that You hold all the planetary systems on Your head merely 
by Your partial expansion as Se�a. You are the sustainer of the whole 
universe. My dear Supreme Personality of Godhead, You are full of six 
opulences. Because I forgot Your omnipotence, I have mistakenly disobeyed 
Your order, and thus I have become a great offender. But, my dear Lord, 
please know that I am a surrendered soul unto You. You are very much 
affectionate to Your devotees. Therefore please excuse my impudence 
and mistakes and, by Your causeless mercy, may You now release me." 
80 
Kf��a, the Supreme Personality of Godhead 
Upon displaying this submissive attitude, Yamuna was forgiven, and 
when she came nearby, Lord Balarama wanted to enjoy the pleasure of 
swimming within her water along with the gopis in the same way an 
elephant enjoys himself along with his many she-elephants. After a long 
time, when Lord Balarama had enjoyed to His full satisfaction, He came 
out of the water, and immediately a goddess of fortune offered Him a 
nice blue garment and a valuable necklace made of gold. After taking 
bath in the Yamuna, Lord Balarama, dressed in blue garments and 
decorated with golden ornaments, looked very attractive to everyone. 
Lord Balarama's complexion is white, and when He was properly dressed 
He looked exactly like the white elephant of King Indra in the heavenly 
planet. The River Yam una still has many small branches due to being 
scratched by the plowshare of Lord Balarama. And all these branches of 
the River Yamuna are still glorifying the omnipotency of Lord Balarama. 
Lord Balarama and the gopis enjoyed transcendental pastimes together 
every night for two months, and time passed away so quickly that all 
those nights appeared to be only one night. In the presence of Lord 
Balarama, all the go pis and inhabitants of V rndavana became as cheerful 
as they had been before in the presence of both brothers, Lord Kr�!la 
and Lord Balarama. 
Thus ends the Bhaktivedanta purport of the Second Volume, Tenth 
Chapter of Kr��a, "Lord Balariima Visits Vrndiivana." 
11 I Deliverance of Paundraka 
• 
• 
and the King of Kasi 
The story of King Pau:p�raka is very interesting because there have 
always been many rascals and fools who have considered themselves to be 
God. Even in the presence of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Kr�:pa, 
there was such a foolish person. His name was Pau:p�raka, and He wanted 
to declare himself to be God. While Lord Balarama was absent in 
V rndavana, this King Pau:p�raka, the King of the Karii�a province, being 
foolish and puffed up, sent a messenger to Lord Kr�:pa. Lord Kf�:pa is 
accepted as the Supreme Personality· of Godhead, and King Pau:p�raka di­
rectly challenged Kf�:pa through the messenger, who stated that Pau:p�raka, 
and not Kr�:pa, was Vasudeva. In the present day there are many foolish 
followers of such rascals. Similarly, in his day, many foolish men accepted 
Pau:p�raka as the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Because he could not 
estimate his own position, Pau:p�raka falsely thought himself to be Lord 
Vasudeva. Thus the messenger declared to Kr�:pa that out of his causeless 
mercy, King Pau:p�raka, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, had 
descended on the earth just to deliver all distressed persons. 
Surrounded by many other- foolish persons, this rascal Pau:p�raka had 
actually concluded that he was Vasudeva, the Supreme Personality of 
Godhead. This kind of conclusion is certainly childish. When children are 
playing, they sometimes create a king amongst themselves, and the child 
who is so selected thinks that he is the king. Similarly, many foolish 
persons, due to ignorance, select another fool as God, and then the rascal 
considers himself God, as if God could be created by childish play or by 
the votes of men. Under this false impression, thinking himself the Su­
preme Lord, Pau:p�raka sent his messenger . to Dvaraka to challenge the 
position of Kf�:pa. The messenger reached the royal assembly of Kr�:pa in 
Dvaraka and conveyed the message given by his master, Pau:p�raka. The 
message contained the following statements. 
81 
82 
Kr��a, the Supreme Personality of Godhead 
"I am the only Supreme Personality of Godhead, Vasudeva. There is no 
man who can compete with me. I have descended as King Pau�9raka, 
taking compassion on the distressed conditioned souls out of my unlimited 
causeless mercy. You have falsely taken the position of Vasudeva without 
authority, but you should not propagate this false idea. You must give up 
Your position. 0 descendant of the Y adu dynasty, please give up all the 
symbols of Vasudeva which You have falsely assumed. And after giving up 
this position, come and surrender unto me. If out of Your gross impudence 
You do not care for my words, then I challenge You to fight. I am inviting 
You to a battle in which the decision will be settled." 
When all the members of the royal assembly, including King U grasena, 
heard this message sent by Pau!J-9raka, they laughed very loudly for a 
considerable time. After enjoying the loud laughter of all the members of 
the assembly, Kr�!la replied to the messenger as follows. "0 messenger of 
Pau!J-9raka, you may carry My message to your master: He is a foolish 
rascal. I dire(:tl y call him a rascal, and I refuse to follow his instructions. I 
shall never give up the symbols of Vasudeva, especially My disc. I shall 
use this disc to kill not only King Pau!l9raka but all his followers also. I 
shall destroy this Pau!J-9raka and his foolish associates, who merely con­
stitute a society ot cheaters and cheated. When this action is taken, foolish 
King, you will have to conceal your face in disgrace, and when your head 
is severed from your body by My disc, it will be surrounded by meat-eating 
birds like vultures, hawks and eagles. At that time, instead of becoming My 
shelter as you have demanded, you will be subjected to the mercy of these 
low-born birds. At that time your body will be thrown to the dogs, who 
will eat it with great pleasure." 
The messenger carried the words of Lord Kr��a to his master, Pau�9raka, 
who patiently heard all these insults. Without waiting longer, Lord Sri 
Kr��a immediately started out on His chariot to punish the rascal 
Pau�9raka. Because at that time the King of Karii�a was living with his 
friend the King of Kasi, KH�a surrounded the whole city of Kasi. 
King Pau�9raka was a great warrior, and as soon as he heard of Kr��a 's 
attack, he came out of the city along with two ak§auhiri divisions of 
soldiers. The King of Kasi was also a friend to King Pau�9raka, and he 
came out with three ak§auhiri divisions. When the two kings came before 
Lord Kr��a to oppose Him, Kr��a saw Pau�9raka face to face for the first 
time. Kr�!la saw that Pau�9raka had decorated himself with the symbols 
of the conchshell, disc, lotus and club. He carried the Sarnga bow, and on 
his chest was the insignia of Srivatsa. His neck was decorated with a false 
Kaustubha jewel, and he wore a flower garland in exact imitation of Lord 
Deliverance of Pau�c;Iraka and the King of Kasi
83 
Vasudeva. He was dressed in yellow colored silken garments, and the flag 
on his chariot carried the symbol of Garuc;Ia, exactly imitating Kr��a's. He 
had a very valuable helmet on his head, and his earrings, like swordfish, 
glittered brilliantly. On the whole, however, his dress and makeup were 
clearly imitation. Anyone could understand that he was just like someone 
onstage playing the part of Vasudeva in false dress. When Lord Sri Kr�pa 
saw Pau�c)raka imitating His posture and dress, He could not check His 
laughter, and thus He laughed with great satisfaction. 
The soldiers on the side of King Pau�c)raka began to shower their weap­
ons upon Kr�pa. The weapons, including various kinds of tridents, clubs, 
poles, lances., swords, daggers and arrows, came flying in waves, and Kf�pa 
counteracted them. He smashed not onlythe weapons but also the soldiers 
and assistants of Paupc)raka, just as during the dissolution of this universe 
the fire of devastation burns everything to ashes. The elephants, chariots, 
horses, and infantry belonging to the opposite party were scattered by the 
weapons of Kf�pa. The whole battlefield became scattered with the bodies 
of animals and chariots. There were fallen horses, elephants, men, asses 
and camels. Although the devastated battlefield appeared like the dancing 
place of Lord Siva at the time of the dissolution of the world, the warriors 
who were on the side of Kr�pa were very much encouraged by seeing this, 
and they fought with greater strength. 
At this time, Lord Kr��a told Paupc)raka, "Paupc)raka, you requested Me 
to give up the symbols of Lord Vi�pu, specifically My disc. Now I will give 
it up to you. Be careful! You falsely declare yourself to be Vasudeva, 
imitating Myself. Therefore no one is a greater fool than you." From this 
statement of Kr�pa 's it is clear that any rascal who advertises himself as 
God is the greatest fool in human society. Kr�pa continued: "Now, Paup­
c)raka, I shall force you to give up this- false representation. You wanted Me 
to surrender unto you. Now this is your opportunity. We shall now fight, 
and if I am defeated and you become victorious, I shall certainly surrender 
unto you." In this way, after chastising Paupc)raka very severely, He 
smashed his chariot to pieces by shooting an arrow. With the help of His 
disc He separated the head of Paupc)raka from his body, just as Indra 
shaves off the peaks of mountains by striking them with his thunderbolt. 
Similarly, He also killed the King of Kasi with His arrows. Lord Kr�pa 
specifically arranged to throw the head of the King of Kasi into the city of 
Kasi itself so that his relatives and family members could see it. This was 
done by Kr�pa just as a hurricane carries a lotus petal here and there. Lord 
Kr�pa killed Paupc)raka and his friend Kasiraja on the battlefield, and then 
He returned to His capital city, Dvaraka. 
84 
Kr��a, the Supreme Personality of Godhead 
When Lord Kr�!la returned to the city of Dvaraka, all the Siddhas from 
the heavenly planets were singing the glories of the Lord. As far as 
Pau!l9raka was concerned, somehow or other he was always thinking of 
Lord Vasudeva by falsely dressing himself in that way, and therefore 
Pau!l9raka achieved siiriipya, one of the five kinds of liberation, and was 
thus promoted to the V aiku!ltha planets, where the devotees have the 
same bodily features as Vi�!lu, with four hands holding the four symbols. 
Factually, his meditation was concentrated on the Vi�!lu form, hut because 
he thought himself to he Lord Vi�!lu, it was offensive. After being killed 
by Kr�!la, however, that offense was also mitigated. Thus he was given 
siiriipya liberation, and he attained the same form as the Lord. 
When the head of the King of Kasi was thrown through the city gate, 
people gathered and were astonished to see that wonderful thing. When 
they found out that there were earrings on it, they could understand that 
it was someone 's head. They conjectured as to whose head it might he. 
Some thought it was Kr�!la 's head because Kr�!la was the enemy of 
Kas'iraja, and they calculated that the King of KaSi' might have . thrown 
Kr�!la 's head into the city so that the people might take pleasure that the 
enemy was killed. But it was finally detected that the head was not Kr�!ia's, 
hut that of Kasiraja himself. When it was so ascertained, the queens of the 
King of Kasi immediately approached and began to lament the death of 
their husband. "My dear lord," they cried, "upon your death, we have 
become just like dead bodies." 
The King of KaSi' had one son whose name was Sudak�i!la. After 
observing the ritualistic funeral ceremonies, he took a vow that since Krwa 
was the enemy of his father, he would kill Kr�!la and in this way liquidate 
his debts to his father. Therefore, accompanied by a learned priest 
qualified to help him, he began to worship Mahadeva, Lord Siva. The 
lord of the kingdom of KaSi' is Visvanatha (Lord Siva). The temple of Lord 
Visvanatha is still existing in Vara!lasi, and many thousands of pilgrims 
still gather daily in that temple. By the worship of Sudak�i!la, Lord Siva 
was very much pleased, and he wanted to give a benediction to his devotee. 
Sudak�i!la's purpose was to kill Kr�!la, and therefore he prayed for a 
specific power by which he could kill Him. Lord Siva advised that 
Sudak�i!la, assisted by the briihmarws, execute the ritualistic ceremony for 
killing one's enemy. This ceremony is also mentioned in some of the 
Tantras. Lord Siva informed Sudak�i!la that if such a black ritualistic 
ceremony were performed properly then the evil spirit named Dak�i!lagni 
would appear to carry out any order given to him. He would have to he 
employed, however, to kill someone other than a qualified briihmarw. In
Deliverance of Pau��raka and the King of KaSi 
85 
such a case he would be accompanied by Lord Siva's ghostly companions, 
and the desire of Sudak�ipa to kill his enemy would be fulfilled. 
When Sudak�ipa was encouraged by Lord Siva in that way, he became 
assured that he would be able to kill Kr�pa. With a determined vow of 
austerity, he began to execute the black art of chanting mantras, assisted 
by the priests. After this, out of the fire came a great demonic form, whose 
hair, beard and moustache were exactly the color of hot copper. This form 
was very big and fierce. As the demon arose from the fire, cinders of fire 
emanated from the sockets of his eyes. The giant fiery demon appeared 
still more fierce due to the movements of his eyebrows. He exhibited long 
sharp teeth and, sticking out his long tongue, licked both sides of his lips. 
He was naked, and he carried a big trident, which was blazing like fire. 
After appearing from the fire of sacrifice, he stood wielding the trident in 
his hand. Instigated by Sudak�ipa, the demon proceeded toward the 
capital city, Dvaraka, along with many hundreds of ghostly companions, 
and it appeared that he was going to burn all outer space to ashes. The 
surface of the earth .trembled because of his striking steps. When he 
entered the city of Dvaraka, all the residents panicked, just like animals 
at the time of a forest fire. 
At that time Kr�pa was engaged in playing chess in the royal assembly 
council hall. All the residents of Dvaraka approached and addressed Him, 
"Dear Lord of the three worlds, there is a great fiery demon ready to burn 
the whole city of Dvaraka. Please save us." Thus, after approaching Lord 
K.f�pa, all the inhabitants of Dvaraka began to appeal to Him for protection 
from the fiery demon who had just appeared in Dvaraka to devastate the 
whole city. 
Lord Kr�pa, who specifically protects His devotees, saw that the whole 
population of Dvaraka was most perturbed by the presence of the great 
fiery demon. He immediately began to smile and assured them, "Don't 
worry. I shall give you all protection." The Supreme Personality of God­
head, Kr�pa, is all-pervading. He is within everyone's heart, and He is with­
out also in the form of the cosmic manifestation. He could understand 
that the fiery demon was a creation of Lord Siva, and in order to vanquish 
him He took His Sudarsana-cakra and ordered him to take the necessary 
steps. The Sudarsana-cakra appeared with the effulgence of millions of 
suns, his temperature being as powerful as that of the fire created at the 
end of the cosmic manifestation. By his own effulgence, the Sudarsana­
cakra began to illuminate the entire universe, on the surface of the earth 
as well as in outer space. Then the Sudarsana-cakra began to freeze the 
fiery demon created by Lord Siva. In this way, the fiery demon was 
86 
Kr��a, the Supreme Personality of Godhead 
checked by the Sudarsana-cakra of Lord Kr��a, and being defeated in his 
attempt to devastate the city of Dvaraka, he turned back. 
Having failed to set fire to Dvaraka, he went back to Varapasi, the 
kingdom of Kasiraja. As a result of his return, all the priests who had 
helped instruct the black art of mantras, along with their employer, 
Sudak�ipa were burned into ashes by the glaring effulgence of the fiery 
demon. According to the methods of black art mantras instructed in the 
Tantra, if the mantra fails to kill the enemy, then, because it must kill 
someone, it kills the original creator. Sudak�ipa was the originator, and the 
priests assisted him; therefore all of them were burned to ashes. This is the 
way of the demons: the demons create something to kill God, but by the 
same weapon the demons themselves are killed. 
Following just behind the fiery demon, the Sudarsana-cakra also entered 
Varapasi. This city of Varapasi had been very opulent and great for a very 
long time. Even now, the city of Varapasi is very opulent and famous, and 
it is one of the important cities of India. There were then many big 
palaces, assembly houses, marketplaces and gates, with very important 
large monuments by the palaces and gates. Lecturing platforms could be 
found at each and every crossing of the roads. There was a treasury house, 
and elephant heads, horse heads, chariots, granaries and places for distribu­
tion of foodstuff. The city of Varapasi had been filled with all these 
material opulences for a very long time, but because the king of KaSi and 
his son Sudak�ipa were against Lord Kr�pa, the Vi�pu-cakra Sudarsana 
(the disc weapon of Lord Kr�pa) devastated the whole city by burning all 
these important places. This excursion was more ravaging than modern 
bombing. The Sudarsana-cakra, having thus finished his duty, came back 
to his Lord Sri Kf�pa at Dvaraka. 
This narration of the devastation of Varapasi by K��I_la's disc weapon, 
the Sudarsana-cakra, is transcendental and auspicious. Anyone who narrates 
this �tory or anyone who hears this story with faith and attention will be 
released from all reaction to sinful activities. This is the assurance of 
Sukadeva Gosvami who narrated this story to Parik�it Maharaja. 
Thus ends the Second Volume, Eleventh Chapter, ofKfwa, "Deliverance
of Paur!lraka.and the King of Kiisi."
12 I Deliverance of Dvivida Gorilla 
While Sukadeva Gosvami continued to speak on the transcendental 
pastimes and characteristics of Lord K��f}a, King PanK:�it, upon hearing 
him, became more and more enthusiastic and wanted to hear further. 
Sukadeva Gosvami next narrated the story of Dvivida, the gorilla who was 
killed by Lord Balarama. 
This gorilla was a great friend of Baumasura's or Narakasura's, who was 
killed by Kr��a in connection with his kidnapping sixteen thousand prin­
cesses from all over the world. Dvivida was the minister of King Sugriva. His 
brother, Mainda, was also a very powerful gorilla king. When Dvivida 
gorilla heard the story of his friend Baumasura 's being killed by Lord 
K��f}a, he planned to create mischief throughout the country in order to 
avenge the death of Baumasuta. His first business was to set fires in 
villages, towns, and industrial and mining places, as well as the residential 
quarters of the mercantile men who were busy dairy farming and protec­
ting cows. Sometimes he would uproot a big mountain and tear it to 
pieces. In this way he created great disturbances all over the country, 
especially in the province of Kathwar. The city of Dvaraka· was situated in 
this Kathwar province, and because Lord K��qa used to live in this city, 
Dvivida specifically made it his target of disturbance. 
Dvivida was as powerful as 10,000 elephants. Sometimes he would go 
to the seashore, and with his powerful hands he would create so much 
disturbance in the sea that he would overflood the neighboring cities and 
villages. Often he would go to the hermitages of great saintly persons and 
sages and cause a great disturbance by smashing their beautiful gardens 
and orchards. Not only did he create disturbances in that way, but 
sometimes he would pass urine and stool on their sacred sacrificial arena. 
He would thus pollute the whole atmosphere. He also kidnapped both 
men and women, taking them away from their residential places to the 
87 
88 
Kr�!la, the Supreme Personality of Godhead 
caves of the mountains. Putting them within the caves, he would close the 
entrances with large chunks of stone, like the bh[hgi insect, which arrests 
and carries away many flies and other insects and puts them within the 
holes of the trees where he lives. He thus regularly defied the law and 
order of the country. Not only that, but he would sometimes pollute the 
female members of many aristocratic families by forcibly raping them. 
While creating such great disturbance all over the country, sometimes he 
heard very sweet musical sounds from the Raivataka mountain, and so he 
entered that mountainous region. There he saw that Lord Balarama was 
present in the midst of many beautiful young girls, enjoying their company 
while engaged in singing and dancing. He became captivated by the beauti­
ful features of Lord Balarama's body, each and every part of which was 
very beautiful, decorated as He was with a garland of lotus flowers. 
Similarly, all the young girls present, dressed and garlanded with flowers, 
exhibited much beauty. Lord Balarama seemed to be fully intoxicated 
from drinking the Varu!li beverage, and His eyes appeared to be rolling in 
a drunken state. Lord Balarama appeared just like the king of the elephants 
in the midst of many she-elephants. 
This gorilla by the name of Dvivida could climb up on the trees and 
jump from one branch to another. Sometimes he would jerk the branches, 
creating a particular type of sound, "Kila, kila," so that Lord Balarama 
was greatly distracted from the pleasing atmosphere. Sometimes Dvivida 
would come before the women and exhibit different types of caricatures. 
By nature young women are apt to enjoy everything with laughter and 
joking, and when the gorilla came before thein they did not take him 
seriously, but simply laughed at him. However, the gorilla was so rude that 
even in the presence of Balarama he began to show the lower part of his 
body to the women, and sometimes he would come forward to show his 
teeth while moving his eyebrows. He disrespected the women, even in the 
presence of Balarama. Lord Balarama 's name suggests that He is not only 
very powerful, but that He takes pleasure in exhibiting extraordinary 
strength. So He took a stone and threw it at Dvivida. The gorilla, however, 
artfully avoided being struck by the stone. In order to insult Balarama, 
the gorilla took away the earthen pot in which the Varu!li was kept. 
Dvivida, being thus intoxicated, with his limited strength began to tear off 
all the valuable clothes worn by Balarama and the accompanying young 
girls. He was so puffed up that he thought that Balarama could not do 
anything to chastise him, and he continued to offend Balaramaji and 
His companions. 
When Lord Balarama personally saw the disturbances created by the 
Deliverance of Dvivida Gorilla 
89 
gorilla and heard that he had already performed many mischievous activi­
ties all over the country, He became very angry and decided to kill him. 
Immediately He took His club in His hands. The gorilla could understand 
that now Balarama was going to attack him. In order to counteract 
Balarama, he immediately uprooted a big oak tree, and with great force he 
came and struck at Lord Balarama's head. Lord Balarama, however, 
immediately caught hold of the big tree and remained undisturbed, just 
like a great mountain. To retaliate, He took His club by the name of 
Sunanda and began to hit the gorilla with it. The gorilla's head was 
severely injured. Currents of blood flowed from his head with great force, 
but the stream of blood enhanced his beauty like a stream of liquid 
manganese coming out of a great mountain. The striking of Balarama's 
club did not even slightly disturb him. On the contrary, he immediately 
uprooted another big oak tree, and after clipping off all its leaves, he 
began to strike Balarama 's head with it. But Balarama, with the help of 
His club, tore the tree to pieces. Since the gorilla was very angry, he took 
another tree in his hands and began to strike �ord Balarama's body. 
Again Lord Balarama tore the tree to pieces, and the fighting continued. 
Each time the gorilla would bring out a big tree to strike Balarama, Lord 
Balarama would tear the tree to pieces by the striking of His club. The 
gorilla Dvivida would clutch another tree from another direction and again 
attack Balarama in the same way. As a result of this continuous fighting, 
the forest became treeless. When no more trees were available, Dvivida 
took help from the hills and threw large pieces of stone, like rainfall, upon 
the body of Balarama. Lord Balarama, also in a great sporting mood, began 
to smash those big pieces of stone into mere pebbles. The gorilla, being 
bereft of all trees and stone slabs, now stood before Him and waved his 
strong fists. Then, with great force, .he began to beat the chest of Lord 
Balarama with his fists. This time Lord Balarama became most angry. 
Since the gorilla was striking Him with his hands, He would not strike him 
back with His own weapons, the club or the plow. Simply with His fist He 
began to strike the collarbone of the gorilla. This striking proved to be 
fatal to Dvivida, who immediately vomited blood and fell unconscious 
upon the ground. When the gorilla fell, it appeared that all the hills and 
forests tottered. 
After this horrible incident, all the Siddhas, great sages and saintly 
persons from the upper planetary system began to shower flowers on the 
person of Lord Balarama, and sounds glorifying the supremacy of Lord 
Balarama were vibrated. All of them began to chant, "All glories to Lord 
Balarama! Let us offer our respectful obeisances unto Your lotus feet. By 
90 
J<.r�J)a, the Supreme Personality of Godhead 
Your killing this great demon, Dvivida, You have initiated an auspicious 
era ; for· the· world." All such jubilant sounds of victory were heard from 
outer space� After killing the great demon Dvivida and being worshiped by 
showers of flowers and glorious sounds of victory, Balarama returned to 
His cap�tal city, Dviiraka. 
Thus ends the Bhaktivedanta purport of the Second Volumf!, Twelfth 
Chapter, of J<.r�J)a, "Deliverance of Dvivida Gorilla. '' 
13 I The Marriage of Samba 
Duryodhana, the son of Dhrtara�tra, had a marriageable daughter by 
the name of Lak�ma!la. She was a very highly qualified girl of the Kuru 
dynasty, and many princes wanted to marry her. In such cases, the sva­
yarhvara ceremony is held so that the girl may select her husband according 
to her own choice. In Lak�mapa's svayarhvara assembly, when the girl 
was to select her husband, Samba appeared. He was the son of Kr�!la_ by 
Jambavati, one of the chief wives of Lord Kr�!la. This son Samba is so 
named because he was a very bad child, and he always lived close to his 
mother. The name Samba indicates a son who is very much his mother's 
pet. -A mbii �eans mother, and sa means with. So this special name was 
given to him. because he always remained with his mother. He was also 
known as Jambavatisuta for the same reason. As previously explained, all 
the sons of Kr�!la were as qualified as their great father, Lord Kr�!ia. Samba 
wanted the daughter of Duryodhana, Lak�ma!la, although she was not 
inclined to have him. Therefore Samba kidnapped Lak�ma!la by force 
from the svayarhvara assembly. 
Because Samba took Lak�ma!la away from the assembly by force, all 
the members of the Kuru dynasty, namely, Dhrtara�tra, Bhi�ma, Vidura, 
Ujahan and Arjuna, thought it an insult to their family tradition that the 
boy, Samba, could possibly have kidnapped their daughter. All of them 
knew that Laksmana was not at all inclined to select him as a husband and 
. 
. 
-
that she was not given the chance to select her own husband; instead she 
was forcibly taken away by this boy. Therefore, they decided that he must 
be punished. They unanimously declared that he was most impudent and 
that he had degraded the Kurus' family tradition. Therefore, all of them, 
under the counsel of the elderly members of the Kuru family, decided to 
arrest the boy but not kill him. They concluded that the girl could not be 
married to anr boy other than Samba since she had already been touched 
91 
92 
KH�a, the Supreme Personality of Godhead 
by him. (According to the Vedic system, once being used by some boy, a 
girl cannot be married or given to any other boy. Nor would anyone agree 
to marry a girl who had already thus associated with another boy.) The 
elderly members of the family, such as Bhi�ma, wanted to arrest him. All 
the members of the Kuru dynasty, especially the great fighters, joined 
together just to teach him a lesson, and Kar�a was made the commander­
in-chief for this small battle. 
While the plan was being made to arrest Samba, the Kurus counciled 
amongst themselves that upon his arrest, the members of theY adu dynasty 
would be very angry with them. There was every possibility of the Yadus' 
accepting the challenge and fighting with them. But they also thought, 
"If they came. here to fight with us, what could they do? The members 
of the Yadu ·dynasty cannot equal the members of the Kuru dynasty 
because the kings of the Kuru dynasty are the emperors, whereas the 
kings of the Yadu dynasty are able to enjoy their landed property." The 
Kurus thought, "If they come here to challenge us because their son was 
arrested, we will nevertheless accept the fight. All of us will teach them a 
lesson, so that automatically they will become subdued under pressure, as 
the senses are subdued by the mystic yoga process, prar-ayiima." (In the 
mechanical system of mystic yoga, the airs within the body are controlled, 
and the senses are f:ubdued and checked from being engaged in anything
other than meditation upon Lord Vi��u.)
After consultation and after receiving permission from the elderly mem­
bers of the Kuru dynasty, such as Bhi�ma and Dhrtara�tra, six great warriors 
-Kar�a, Sala, Bhurisrava, Yajfiaketu, and Duryodhana, the father of the 
girl-all mahii-rathis and guided by the great fighter Bhi�madeva,attempted 
to arrest the boy Samba. There are different grades of fighters, including 
mahii-rathi, eka-rathi, and rathi, classified according to their fighting 
capacity. These mahii-rathis could fight alone with many thousands of 
men. All of them combined together to arrest Samba. Samba was also a 
mahii-rathi, but he was alone and had to fight with the six other mahii­
rathis. Still he was not deterred when he saw all the great fighters of the 
Kuru dynasty coming up behind him to arrest him. 
Alone, he turned towards them and took his nice bow, posing exactly 
as a lion stands adamant in the face of other animals. Kar�a was leading 
the party, and he challenged Samba, "Why are you fleeing? Just stand, and 
we shall teach you a lesson!" When challenged by another k§atriya to 
stand and fight, a k§dtriya cannot go away; he must fight. Therefore, as 
soon as Samba accepted the challenge and stood alone before them, he was 
overpowered by showers of arrows thrown by all the great warriors. As a 
The Marriage of Samba 
93 
lion is never afraid of being chased by many wolves and jackals, similarly, 
Samba, the glorious son of the Y adu dynasty, endowed with inconceivable 
potencies as the son of Lord KHv.a, became very angry at the,warriors of 
the Kuru dynasty for improperly using arrows against him. He fought 
them with great talent. First of all, he struck each of the six charioteers 
with six separate arrows. Another four arrows were used to kill the 
charioteers' horses, four on each chariot. One arrow was used to kill the 
driver, and one arrow was used for Karv.a as well as the other celebrated 
fighters. While Samba was so diligently fighting alone with the six great 
warriors, they all appreciated the inconceivable potency of the boy. Even 
in the midst of fighting, they admitted frankly that this boy Samba was 
wonderful. But the fighting was conducted in the k§atriya spirit, so all 
together, although it was improper, they obliged Samba to get down from 
his chariot, now broken to pieces. Of the six warriors, four took care to 
kill Samba's four horses, and one of them managed to cut the string of 
Samba's bow so that he could no longer fight with them. In this way, with 
great difficulty and after a severe fight, Samba was left bereft of his 
chariot, and they were able to arrest him. Thus, the warriors of the Kuru 
dynasty accepted their great victory and took their daughter, Lak�matJ.a, 
away from him. Thereafter, they entered the city of Hastinapura in great 
triumph. 
The great sage Narada immediately carried the news to the Yadu dynasty 
that Samba was arrested and told them the whole story. The members of 
the Yadu dynasty became very angry at Samba's being arrested, and im­
properly so by six warriors. Now, with the permission of the head of the 
Yadu dynasty's king, Ugrasena, they prepared to attack the capital city of 
the Kuru dynasty. 
Although Lord Balarama knew very well that by slight provocation 
people are prepared to fight with one another in the age of Kali, He did 
not like the idea that the two great dynasties, the Kuru dynasty and the 
Y adu dynasty, would fight amongst themselves, even though they were 
influenced by Kali-yuga. "Instead of fighting with them," He wisely 
thought, "let Me go there and see the situation, and let Me try to ·see if the 
fight can be settled by mutual understanding." Balarama's idea was that if 
the Kuru dynasty could be induced to release Samba along with his wife, 
Lak�mav.a, then the fight could be avoided. He therefore immediately 
arranged for a nice chariot to go to Hastinapura, accompanied by learned 
priests and briihmar-as, as well as by some of the elderly members of the 
Yadu dynasty. He was confident that the members of the Kuru dynasty 
would agree to this marriage and avoid fighting amongst themselves. As 
94 
Kr��a, the Supreme Personality of Godhead 
Lord Balarama proceeded towards Hastinapura in this chariot, accompanied 
by the learned briihmarzas and the elderly members of the Yadu dynasty, 
He looked like the moon shining in the clear sky amongst the glittering 
stars. When Lord Balarama reached the precincts of the city of Hastinapura, 
He did not enter, but stationed ·Himself in a camp outside the city in a 
small garden house. Then He asked U ddhava to see the leaders of the Kuru 
dynasty and inquire from them whether they wanted to fight with the 
Y adu dynasty or to make a settlement. U ddhava went to see the leaders of 
the Kuru dynasty, and he met all the important members, including 
Bhi�madeva, Dhrtara�tra, Dro�acarya, Bali, Duryodhana and Bahlika. After 
offering them due respects, . he informed them that Lord Balarama had 
already arrived at the garden, outside the city door. 
The leaders of the Kuru dynasty, especially D hrtara�tra and Duryodhana, 
were very joyful because they knew very well that Lord Balarama was a 
great well-wisher of their family. There were no bounds to their joy on 
hearing the news, and so immediately they welcomed Uddhava. In order 
to properly receive Lord Balarama, they all took auspicious paraphernalia 
for His reception in their hands and went to see Him outside the city door. 
According to their respective positions, they welcomed Lord Balarama by 
giving Him in charity nice cows and argha (an assortment of articles such 
as iiriitrika water, sweet preparations of honey, butter, etc., and flowers, 
and garlands scented with pulp). Because all of them knew the exalted 
position of Lord Balarama as the Supreme Personality of Godhead, they 
bowed their heads before the Lord with great respect. They all exchanged 
words of reception by asking one another of their welfare, and when such 
formality was finished, Lord Balarama, in a great voice and very patiently, 
submitted before them the following words for their consideration. "My 
dear friends, this time I have come to you as a messenger with the order of 
the all-powerful King Ugrasena. Please, therefore, hear the order with atten­
tion and great care. Without wasting a single moment, please try to carry 
out the order. King Ugrasena knows very well that you warriors of the 
Kuru dynasty improperly fought with the pious Samba, who was alone, 
and that with great difficulty and tactics you have arrested him. We have 
all heard this news, but we are not very agitated because we are most 
intimately related to each other. I do not think we should disturb our 
good relationship; we should continue our friendship without any un­
necessary fighting. Please, therefore, immediately release Samba and bring 
him, along with his wife, Lak�mal}a, before Me." 
When Lord Balarama spoke in 
a commanding tone full of heroic 
assertion, supremacy and chivalry, His statements were not appreciated by 
The Marriage of Samba 
95 
the leaders of the Kuru dynasty. Rather, all of them became agitated, and 
with great anger they said: "Hello! These words are very astonishing but 
quite befitting the age of Kali; otherwise .how could Balarama speak so 
vituperatively? The language and tone used by Balarama are simply 
abusive, and due to the influence of this age, it appears that the shoes 
befitting the feet want to rise to the top of the head where the helmet is 
worn. We are connected with the Y adu dynasty by marriage, and because 
of this they have been given the chance to come live with us, dine with us, 
and sleep with us; now they are taking advantage of these privileges. They 
had practically no position before we gave them a portion of our kingdom 
to rule, and now they are trying to command us. We have allowed the Y adu 
dynasty to use the royal insignias like the whisk, fan, conchshell, white 
umbrella, crown, royal throne, sitting place, bedstead, and everything 
befitting the royal order. They should not have used such royal parapher­
nalia in our presence, but we did not check them due to our family rela­
tionships. Now they have the audacity to order us to do things. Well, this 
is enough of their impudence! We cannot allow them to do any more of 
these things, nor shall we allow them to use these royal insigr:.ias. It would 
be best to take all these things away; it is improper to feed a snake with 
milk, since such merciful activities simply increase his venom. The Y adu 
dynasty is now trying to go against those who have fed them so nicely. 
Their flourishing condition is due to our gifts and merciful behavior, and 
still they are so shameless that they are trying to order us. How regrettable 
are all these activities! No one in the world can enjoy anything if the 
members of the Kuru dynasty like Bhi�ma, Dro�acarya and Arjuna do not 
allow them to. Exactly as a lamb cannot enjoy life in the presence of a 
lion, without our desire it is not even possible for the demigods in heaven, 
headed by King Indra, to find enjoyment in life, not to speak of ordinary 
human beings!" Actually the members of the Kuru dynasty were very 
puffed up due to their opulence, kingdom, aristocracy, family tradition, 
great warriors, family members and vast expansive empire. They did not 
even observe common formalities of civilized society, and in the presence 
of Lord Balarama they uttered insulting words about the Y adu dy­
nasty. Speaking in this unmannerly way, they returned to their city of 
Hastinapura. 
Although Lord Balarama patiently heard their insulting words and 
simply observed their uncivil behavior, from His appearance it was clear 
that He was burning with anger and was thinking of retaliating with great 
vengeance. His bodily features became so agitated that it was difficult for 
anyone to look at Him. He Jaughed very loudly and said: "It is true that if 
96 
Kr��a, the Supreme Personality of Godhead 
a man becomes too puffed up because of his family, opulence, beauty and 
material advancement, he no longer wants a peaceful life but becomes 
belligerent toward all others. It is useless to give such a person good 
instruction for gentle behavior and peaceful life, but on the contrary, one 
should search out the ways and means to punish him." Generally, due to 
material opulence a man becomes exactly like an animal. To give an animal 
peaceful instructions is useless, and the only means is argumentum 
vaculum. In other words, the only means to keep animals in order is a 
stick. "Just see how impudent the members of the Kuru dynasty are! I 
wanted to make a peaceful settlement despite the anger of all the other 
members of the Y adu dynasty, including Lord Kr��a Himself. They were 
preparing to attack the whole kingdom of the Kuru dynasty, but I pacified 
them and took the trouble to come here to settle the affair without any 
fighting. Still these rascals behave like this! It is clear that they do not 
want a peaceful settlement, but that they are factually warmongers. 
With great pride they have repeatedly insulted Me by calling the Y adus 
dynasty ill names. 
"Even the King of heaven, Indra, abides by the order of the Yadu 
dynasty; and you consider King Ugrasena, who is the head of the Bhojas, 
Vr��is, Andhakas and Yadavas, to be the leader of a small phalanx! Your 
conclusion is wonderful! You do not care for King U grasena, whose order 
is obeyed even by King lndra. Consider the exalted position of the Y adu 
dynasty. They have forcibly used both the assembly house and the 
piirijiita tree of the heavenly planet, and still you think that they cannot 
order you. Don't you even think that Lord Kr��a, the Supreme Personality 
of Godhead, can sit on the exalted royal throne and command everyone? 
All right! If your thinking is like that, then you deserve to be taught a very 
good lesson. You have thought it wise that the royal insignias like the 
whisk, fan, white umbrella, royal throne and other princely paraphernalia 
not be used by the Yadu dynasty. Does this mean that even Lord Krwa, 
the Lord of the whole creation and the husband of the goddess of fortune, 
cannot use this royal paraphernalia? The dust of i<n�a's lotus feet is 
worshiped by all the great demigods. The Ganges water is inundating the 
whole world, and since it is emanating from His lotus feet, its banks have 
turned into great places of pilgrimage. The principal deities of all planets 
are engaged in His service, and they consider themselves most fortunate to 
take the dust of the lotus feet of Kr��a on their helmets. Great demigods 
like Lord Brahma, Lord Siva, and even the goddess of fortune and I are 
simply plenary parts of His spiritual identity, and still you think that He 
is not fit to use the royal insignia or even sit on the royal throne? Alas, 
The Marriage of Samba 
97 
how regrettable it is that these fools consider us, the members of the Y adu 
dynasty, to be like shoes and themselves like helmets. It is clear now that 
these ·leaders of the Kuru dynasty have become mad over their worldly 
possessions and opulence. Every statement they made was full of crazy 
proposals. I should immediately take them to task and bring them to their 
senses. If I do not take steps against them, it will he improper on My part. 
Therefore, on this very day, I shall rid the whole world of any trace of the 
Kuru dynasty. I shall finish them off immediately!" While talking like this, 
Lord Balarama seemed so furious that He looked as if He could burn the 
whole cosmic creation to ashes. He stood up steadily, and taking His plow 
in His hand, began striking the earth with it. In this way the whole city of 
Hastinapura was separated from the earth. Lord Balarama then began to 
drag the city toward the flowing water of the river Ganges. Because of 
this, there was a great tremor throughout Hastinapura, as if there had been 
an earthquake, and it seemed that the whole city would be dismantled. 
When all the members of the Kuru dynasty saw that their city was 
about to fall into the water of the Ganges and when they heard their 
citizens howling in great anxiety, they immediately came to their senses 
and understood what was happening. Thus without waiting another second 
they brought forward their daughter Lak�ma�a. They also brought Samba, 
who had forcibly tried to take her away, keeping him in the forefront with 
Lak�ma!1a at his back. All the members of the Kuru dynasty appeared 
before Lord Balarama with folded hands just to beg the pardon of the 
Supreme Personality of Godhead. Now using good sense, they said: "0 
Lord Balarama, You are the reservoir of all pleasures. You are the main­
tainer and support of the entire cosmic situation. Unfortunately we were 
·all unaware of Your inconceivable potencies. Dear Lord, please consider
us most foolish. Our intelligence was bewildered and not in order. There­
fore we have come before You to beg Your pardon. Please excuse us. You
·are the original creator, sustainer and annihilator of the whole cosmic mani­
festation, and still Your position is always transcendental. 0 all-powerful
Lord, great sages speak about You. You are the original puppeteer, and
everything in the world is just like Your toys. 0 unlimited one, You have
a hold on everything, and like child's play You hold all the planetary
systems on Your head. When the time for dissolution comes, You close
up the whole cosmic manifestation within Yourself. At that time nothing
remains but Yourself lying in the Causal Ocean as Maha-Vi��u. Our dear
Lord, You have appeared on this earth in Your transcendental body just
for the maintenance of the cosmic situation. You are above all anger, envy
and enmity. Whatever 
You do, even in the form of chastisement, is
98 
Kr��a, the Supreme Personality of Godhead 
auspicious for the whole material existence. We are offering our respectful 
obeisances unto You because You are the imperishable Supreme Person­
ality of Godhead, the reservoir of all opulences and potencies. 0 creator 
of innumerable universes, let us fall down and offer You our respectful 
obeisances, again and again. We are now completely surrendered unto 
You. Please, therefore, be merciful upon us and give us Your protection." 
When the prominent members of the Kuru dynasty, beginning with 
grandfather Bhi�madeva down to Arjuna and Duryodhana, had offered 
their respectful prayers in that way, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, 
Lord Balarama, immediately became softened and assured them there was 
no cause for fear and that they need not worry. 
For the most part it was the practice of the k§atri"ya kings to inaugurate 
some kind of fighting between the parties of the bride and bridegroom 
before the marriage. When Samba forcibly took away Lak�ma!la, the 
elderly members of the Kuru dynasty were pleased to see that he was 
actually the suitable match for her. In order to see his personal strength, 
however, they fought with him, and without any respect for the regula­
tions of fighting, they all arrested him. When the Y adu dynasty decided to 
,release Samba from the confinement of the Kurus, Lord Balarama came 
personally to settle the matter, and as a powerful k§atriya, He ordered 
them to free Samba immediately. The Kauravas became superficially in­
sulted by this order, so they challenged Lord Balarama 's power. They 
simply wanted to see Him exhibit His inconceivable strength. Thus with 
great pleasure they handed over their daughter to Samba, and the whole 
matter was settled. Duryodhana, being affectionate· towards his daughter 
Lak�ma!la, had her married to Samba in great pomp. For her dowry, he 
first gave 1,200 elephants, each of which were at least sixty years old; then 
he gave 10,000 nice horses, 6,000 chariots, which were dazzling just like 
the sunshine, and 1,000 maidservants who were decorated with golden 
ornaments. Lord Balarama, the most prominent member of the Y adu 
dynasty, acted as guardian of the bridegroom Samba and very pleasingly 
accepted the dowry. Balarama was very satisfied after His great reception 
from the side of the Kurus, and accompanied by the newly married couple, 
He started towards His capital city of Dvaraka. 
Lord Balarama triumphantly reached Dvaraka, where He met with many 
citizens who were all His devotees and friends. When they all assembled, 
Lord Balarama narrated the whole story of the marriage, and they were 
astonished to hear how Balarama had made the city of Hastinapura 
tremble. It is confirmed by Sukadeva Gosvami that the site of Hastinapura 
is now known as New Delhi, and the river flowing through the city is called 
The Marriage of Samba 
99 
the Yamuna, although in those days it was known as the Gariges. From 
authorities like Jiva Gosvami it is also confirmed that the Ganges and 
Yam una are the same river flowing in different courses. The part of the 
Ganges which flows through Hastinapura to the area of V rndavana is 
called the Yam una because it is sanctified by the transcendental pastimes 
of Lord Kr�!la. The part of Hastinapura which slopes towards the Yam una 
becomes inundated during the rainy season and reminds everyone of Lord 
Balarama 's threatening to cast the city into the Ganges. 
Thus ends the BhaMivedanta' purport of the Second Volume, Thirteenth 
Chapter, of Kr�!la, "The Marriage of Samba." 
14 I The Great Sage Narada Visits 
the Different Homes of Lord Krsna 
•
•
• 
The great sage Narada heard that Lord Kr��a had married 16,000 wives 
after He had killed the demon Narakasura, sometimes called Bhaumasura. 
Narada became astonished that Lord Kr��a had expanded Himself into 
16,000 forms and married these wives simultaneously in different palaces. 
Being inquisitive as to how Kr��a was managing His household affairs with 
so many wives, Narada desired to see these pastimes and so set out to visit 
Kr��a's different homes. When Narada arrived in Dvaraka, he saw that the 
gardens and parks were full of various flowers of different co1ors and 
orchards that were overloaded with a variety of fruits. Beautiful birds were 
chirping, and peacocks were delightfully crowing. There were tanks and 
ponds full of blue and red lotus flowers, and some of these sites were filled 
with varieties of lilies. The lakes were full of nice swans and cranes whose 
voices resounded everywhere. In the city there were as many as 900,000
great palaces built of first-class marble with gates and doors made of silver. 
The posts of the houses and palaces were bedecked with jewels such as 
touchstone, sapphires and emeralds, and the floors gave off a beautiful 
luster. The highways, lanes, streets, crossings and marketplaces were all 
beautifully decorated. The whole city was full of residential homes, assem­
bly houses, and temples, all of different architectural beauty. All of this 
made ·nvaraka a glowing city. The big avenues, crossings, lanes, streets, and 
also the thresholds of every residential house, were very clean. On both 
sides of every path there were bushes, and at regular intervals there were 
large trees that shaded the avenues so that the sunshine would not bother 
the passersby. 
In this greatly beautiful city of Dvaraka, Lord Kr��a, the Supreme 
Personality of Godhead, had many residential quarters. The great kings 
and princes of the world used to visit these palaces just to worship Him. 
The architectural plans were made personally by Visvakarma, the engineer 
100 
Narada Visits the Different Homes of Lord Kr��a 
101 
of the demigods, and in the construction of the palaces he exhibited all 
of his talents and ingenuity. These residential quarters numbered more 
than 16,000, and a different queen of Lord Kr��a resided in each of them. 
The great sage Narada entered one of these houses and saw that the pillars 
were made of coral and the ceilings were bedecked with jewels. The walls 
as well as the arches between the pillars glowed from the decorations of 
different kinds of sapphires. Throughout the palace there were many 
canopies made by Visvakarma that were decorated with strings of pearls. 
The chairs and other furniture_ were made of ivory, bedecked with gold 
and diamonds, and jeweled lamps dissipated the darkness within the 
palace. There was so much incense and flavored gum burning that the 
scented fumes were coming out of the windows. The peacocks sitting on 
the steps became illusioned by the fumes, mistaking them for clouds, and 
began dancing jubilantly. There were many maidservants, all of whom were 
decorated with gold necklaces, bangles and beautiful saris. There were also 
many male servants, who were nicely dressed in cloaks and turbans and 
jeweled earrings. Beautiful as they were, the servants were all engage_d in 
different household duties. 
Narada saw that Lord Kr��a was sitting with Rukmi�idevi, the mistress 
of that particular palace, who was bearing the rod of a ciimara whisk. Even 
though there· were many thousands of maidservants who were equally 
beautiful and qualified, and who were of the same age, Rukmi�idevi 
personally was engaged in fanning Lord Kr��a. Kr��a is the Supreme 
Personality of Godhead, worshiped even by Narada, but still, as soon as 
He saw Narada enter the palace, Kr��a got down immediately from 
Rukmi�i's bedstead and stood up to honor him. Lord KH�a is the teacher 
of the whole world, and in order to instruct everyone how to respect a 
saintly person like Narada Muni, Kr��a bowed down, touching His helmet 
to the ground. Not only did Kr��a bow down, but He also touched the 
feet of Narada and with folded hands requested him to sit on His chair. 
Lord Kr��a is the Supreme Personality worshiped by all devotees. He is the 
most worshiped spiritual master of everyone. The Ganges water which 
emanates from His feet sanctifies the three worlds. All qualified briihma'{laS 
worship Him, and therefore He is called brahma'{lya-deva. 
Brah-rrw'{lya means one who fully possesses the brahminical qualifica­
tions, which are said to be as follows: truthfulness, self-control, purity, 
mastery of the senses, simplicity, full knowledge by practical application, 
and engagement in devotional service. Lord Kr��a personally possesses all 
these qualities, and He is worshiped by persons who themselves possess 
such qualities. There are thousands and millions of names of Lord Kr��a-

.Kf�pa, the Supreme Personality of Godhead 
Vi�ru-sahasra-numa-and all of them are given to Him because of His 
transcendental qualities. 
Lord KH!la in Dvaraka enjoyed the pastimes of a perfect human being. 
When, therefore, He washed the feet of the sage Narada and took the water 
on His head, Narada did not object, knowing well that the Lord did so to 
teach everyone how to respect saintly persons. The Supreme Personality of 
Godhead, Kr�!la, who is the original Naraya!la and eternal friend of all 
living entities, thus worshiped the sage Narada according to Vedic regulative 
principles. Welcoming him with sweet nectarean words, He addressed 
Narada as bhagavun, or one who is self-sufficient, possessing all kinds of 
knowledge, renunciation, strength, fame, beauty, and similar other opu­
lences. He particularly asked Narada, "What can I do in your service?" 
Narada replied, "My dear Lord, this kind of behavior by Your Lordship 
is not at all astonishing because You are the Supreme Personality of 
Godhead and master of all species of living entities. You are the supreme 
friend of all living entities, but at the same time You are the supreme 
chastiser of the miscreants and the envious. I know that Your Lordship 
has descended on this earth for the proper maintenance of the whole 
universe. Your appearance, therefore, is not forced by any other agency. 
By Your sweet will only, You agree to appear and disappear. It is my 
great fortune that I have been able to see Your lotus feet today. Anyone 
who becomes attached to Your lotus feet is elevated to the supreme 
position of neutrality and is uncontaminated by the material modes of 
nature. My Lord, You are unlimited; there is no limit to Your opulences. 
Great demigods like Lord Brahma and Lord Siva are always busy placing 
You within their hearts and meditating upon You. The conditioned souls 
who have now been put into the blind well of material existence can get 
out of this eternal captivity only by accepting Your lotus feet. Thus, You 
are the only shelter of all conditioned souls. My dear Lord, You have very 
kindly asked what You can do for me. In answer to this I simply request 
that I may not forget Your lotus feet at any time. I do not care where I 
may be, but I pray that I may be allowed to constantly remember Your 
lotus feet." 
The benediction which the sage Narada asked from the Lord is the ideal 
prayer of all pure devotees. A pure devotee never asks for any kind of 
material or spiritual benediction from the Lord, but his only prayer is that 
he may not forget the lotus feet of the Lord in any condition of life. A 
pure devotee does not care whether he is put in heaven or hell; he is 
satisfied anywhere, provided he can constantly remember the lotus feet of 
the Lord. Lord Caitanya also taught this same process of prayer in His 
Narada Visits the Different Homes of Lord Kr��a 
103 
Sik§ii§taka, in which He clearly stated that all He wanted was devotional 
service, birth after birth. A pure devotee does not even want to stop the 
repetition of birth and death. To a pure devotee, it does not matter 
whether he has to take birth again in the various species of life. His only 
ambition is that he may not forget the lotus feet of the Lord in any 
condition of life. 
After departing from the palace of Rukmi!li, Naradaji wanted to see the 
activities of Lord Kr�!la 's internal potency, yogamiiyii; thus he entered the 
palace of another queen. There he saw Lord Kr��a engaged in playing 
chess, along with His dear wife and Uddhava. The Lord immediately got 
up from His seat and invited Narada Muni to sit on His personal seat. The 
Lord again worshiped him with as much paraphernalia for reception as He 
had in the palace of Rukmi!li. After worshiping him properly, Lord Kr��a 
acted as if He did not know what had happened in the palace of Rukmi!li. 
He therefore told Narada, "My dear sage, when your holiness comes here, 
you are full in yourself. Although we are householders and are always in 
need, you don't require anyone's help because you are self -satisfied. 
Under the circumstances, what reception can we offer you, and what can 
we possibly give you? Yet, since your holiness is a briihmar-a, it is our duty 
to offer you something as far as possible. Therefore, I beg your pleasure to 
order Me. What can I do for you?" 
Naradaji knew everything about the pastimes of the Lord, so without 
any further discussion, he simply left the palace silently, in great astonish­
ment over the Lord's activities. He then entered another palace. This time 
Naradaji saw that Lord Kr�!la was engaged as an affectionate father petting 
His small children. From there he entered another palace and saw Lord 
Kr�!la preparing to take His bath. In this way, Saint Narada entered each 
and every one of the sixteen thousand residential palaces of the queens of 
Lord Kr�!la, and in each of them he found Kr�!la engaged in different 
ways. 
In one place he found Kf�J)a engaged in offering oblations to the 
sacrificial fire and performing the ritualistic ceremonies of the Vedas as 
enjoined for householders. In another palace, Kf�J)a was found performing 
the paiica-yajfia sacrifice, which is compulsory for a householder. This 
yajfia is also known as paiica-suna. Knowingly or unknowingly, everyone, 
specifically the householder, is committing five kinds of sinful activities. 
When we receive water from a water pitcher, we kill many germs that are in 
it. Similarly, when we use a grinding machine or take foodstuff, we kill 
many germs. When sweeping a floor or igniting a fire we kill many germs, 
and when we walk on the street we kill many ants and other insects. 
104 
Kr��a, the Supreme Personality of Godhead 
Consciously or unconsciously, in all our different activities, we are killing. 
Therefore, it is incumbent upon every householder to perform the paiica­
silna sacrifice to rid himself of the reactions to such sinful activities. 
In one palace Lord Kr��a was found engaged in feeding briihmaras after 
performing ritualistic yajiias. In another palace, Narada found Kr��a 
engaged in silently chanting the Gayatri mantra, and in a third he found 
Him practicing fighting with a sword and shield. In some palaces Lord 
Kr��a was found riding on horses or elephants or chariots and wandering 
hither and thither. Elsewhere He was found lying down on His bedstead 
taking rest, and somewhere else He was found sitting in His chair, being 
praised by the prayers of His different devotees. In some of the palaces 
He was found consulting with ministers like Uddhava and others on 
important matters of business. In one palace He was found surrounded by 
many young society girls, enjoying in a swimming pool. In another palace 
He was found engaged in giving well-decorated ·cows in charity to the 
brahmaras, and in another palace He was found hearing the narrations of 
thePuraras or histories, such as theMahabharata, which are supplementary 
literatures for disseminating Vedic knowledge to common people by 
narrating important instances in the history of the universe. Somewhere 
Lord KH�a was found enjoying the company of a particular wife by 
exchanging joking words with her. Somewhere else He was found engaged 
along with His wife in religious ritualistic functions. Since it is necessary 
for householders to increase their financial assets for various expenditures, 
Kr��a was found somewhere engaged in matters of economic development. 
Somewhere else He was found enjoying family life according to the 
regulative principles of the sastras. 
In one palace He was found sitting in meditation as if He were concen­
trating His mind on the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who is beyond 
these material universes. Meditation, as recommended in authorized scrip­
ture, is meant for concentrating one's mind on the Supreme Personality 
of Godhead, Vi��u. Lord Kr��a is Himself the original Vi��u, but because 
He played the part of a human being, He taught us definitely by His 
personal behavior what is meant by meditation. Somewhere Lord Krwa 
was found satisfying elderly superiors by supplying them things which 
they needed. Somewhere else Naradaji found that Lord Kr��a was engaged 
in discussing topics of fighting, and somewhere else in making peace with 
enemies. 
Somewhere 
Lord Kr��a was found discussing the ultimate 
auspicious activity for the entire human society with His elder brother 
Lord Balarama. Narada saw Lord KH�a engaged in getting His sons and 
daughters married with suitable brides and bridegrooms in due course of 
time, and the marriage ceremonies were being performed with great pomp. 
Narada Visits the Different Homes of Lord Kr��a 
105 
In one palace He was found bidding farewell to His daughters, and in 
another He was found receiving a daughter-in-law. People throughout the 
whole city were astonished to see such pomp and ceremonies. 
Somewhere the Lord was seen engaged in performing different types of 
sacrifices to satisfy the demigods, who are only Hi� qualitative expansions. 
Somewhere He was seen engaged in public welfare activities, establishing 
deep wells for water supply, rest houses and gardens for unknown guests, 
and great monastaries and temples for saintly persons. These are some of 
the duties enjoined in the Vedas for householders for fulfillment of their 
material desires. Somewhere Kr��a was found as a k§atriya king engaged in 
hunting animals in the forest and riding on very beautiful sindhi horses. 
According to Vedic regulations, the k§atriyas were allowed to kill pre­
scribed animals on certain occasions, either to maintain peace in the 
forests or to offer the animals in the sacrificial fire. K§atriyas are allowed 
to practice this killing art because they have to kill their enemies merci­
lessly to maintain peace in society. In one situation the great sage Narada 
saw Lord Kr��a, the Supreme Personality of Godhead and master of 
mystic powers, acting as a spy by changing His usual dress in order to 
understand the motives of different citizens in the city and within the 
palaces. 
Saint Narada saw all these activities of the Lord, who is the Supersoul of 
all living entities but who played the role of an ordinary human being in 
order to manifest the activities of His internal potency. He was smiling 
within himself and began to address the Lord as follows: "My dear Lord 
of all mystic powers, object of the meditation of great mystics, the 
extent of Your mystic power is certainly inconceivable, even to mystics 
like Lord Brahma and Lord Siva. But by Your mercy, because of my being 
always engaged in the transcendental loving service of Your lotus feet, 
Your Lordship has very kindly revealed to me the actions of Your 
internal potency. My dear Lord, You are worshipable by all, and demigods 
and predominating deities of all fourteen planetary systems are completely 
aware of Your transcendental fame. Now please give me Your blessings so 
that I may be able to travel all over the universes singing the glories of 
Your transcendental activities." 
The Supreme Personality of Godhead, Lord Kr��a, replied to Narada as 
follows: "My dear Narada, 0 sage among the demigods, you know that I 
am the supreme instructor and perfect follower of all religious principles, 
as well as the supreme enforcer of such principles. I am therefore per­
sonally executing such religious principles in order to teach the whole 
world how to act. My dear son, it is My desire that you not be bewildered 
by such demonstrations of My internal energy." 
106 
Kr�!ia, the Supreme Personality of Godhead 
The Supreme Personality of Godhead was engaged in His so-called 
household affairs in order to teach people how one can sanctify one's 
household life although he may be attached to the imprisonment of mate­
rial existence. Actually, one is obliged to continue the term of material 
existence because of household life. But the Lord, being very kind upon 
householders, demonstrated the path of sanctifying ordinary household 
life. Because Kr��a is the center of all activities, a Krwa conscious house­
holder's life is tr.anscendental to Vedic injunctions and is automatically 
sanctified. 
Thus Narada saw one single Kr��a living in sixteen thousand palaces by 
His plenary expansions. Due to His inconceivable energy, He was visible 
in each and every individual queen 's palace. Lord Krwa has unlimited 
power, and Narada's astonishment was boundless upon observing again 
and again the demonstration of Lord Kr��a 's internal energy. Lord Kr�!la 
behaved by His personal example as if He were very .much attached to the 
four principles of civilized life, namely religiousness, economic develop­
ment, sense gratification and salvation. These four principles of material 
existence are necessary for the spiritual advancement of human society, and 
although Lord Kr�!la had no need to do so, He exhibited His household 
activities so that people might follow in His footsteps for their own interest. 
Lord Kr��a satisfied the sage Narada in every way. Narada was very much 
pleased by seeing the Lord's activities in Dvaraka, and thus he departed. 
In narrating the activities of Lord Kr�!la in Dvaraka, Sukadeva Gosvami 
explained to· King Parik�it how Lord Kr��a, the Supreme Personality of 
Godhead, descends on this material universe by the agency of His internal 
potency and personally exhibits the principles which, if followed, can lead 
one to achieve the ultimate goal of life. All the queens in Dvaraka, more 
than sixteen thousand in number, engaged their feminine attractive features 
in the transcendental service of the Lord by smiling and serving, and the 
Lord was pleased to behave with them exactly as a perfect husband enjoy­
ing household life. One should know definitely that such pastimes cannot 
be performed by anyone but Lord Sri Kr�!la. Lord Sri Kr��a is the original 
cause of the creation, maintenance and dissolution of the whole cosmic 
manifestation. Anyone who attentively hears the narrations of the Lord's 
pastimes in Dvaraka or supports a preacher of the Kr��a consciousness 
movement will certainly find it very easy to traverse the path of liberation 
and taste the nectar of the lotus· feet of Lord Kr�!J.a. And thus he will be 
engaged in His devotional service. 
Thus ends the Bhaktivedanta purport of the Second Volume, Fourteenth 
Chapter, of Kr�!J.a, "The Gre.at Sage Niirada Visits the Different Homes of 
Lord Knew." 
15 I Lord Kr��a's Daily Activities
From the Vedic mantras we learn that the Supreme Personality of God­
head has nothing to do: na tasya karyarh k ranarh ca vidyate. If the 
Supreme Lord has nothing to do, then how can we speak of the activities 
of the Supreme Lord? From the previous chapter it is clear that no one 
can act in the w�y that Lord Kr�!la does. We should clearly note this fact: 
the activities of the Lord should be followed, but they cannot be imitated. 
For example, Kr�!la's ideal life as a householder can be followed, but if one 
wants to imitate Kr�!la by expanding into many forms, that is not possible. 
We should always remember, therefore, that Lord Kr�!la, although playing 
the part of a human being, nevertheless simultaneously maintains the 
position of the Suprerrie Personality of Godhead. We can follow Lord 
Kr�!la's dealing with His wives ;;ts an ordinary human being, but His d�aling 
with more than sixteen thousand wives at one time cannot be imitated. 
The conclusion is that to become ideal householders we should follow in the 
footsteps of Lord Kr�!la as He displayed His daily activities, but we cannot 
imitate Him at any stage of our life. 
Lord Kr�!la used to lie down with His sixteen thousand wives, but also 
He would rise up from bed very early in the morning, three hours before 
sunrise. By nature's arrangement the crowing of the cocks warns of the 
bnihma-muhiirta hour. There is no need of alarm clocks; as soon as the 
cocks crow early in the morning, it is to be understood that it is time to 
rise from bed. Hearing that sound, Kr�!la would get up from bed, but His 
rising early was not very much to the liking of His wives. The wives of 
Kr�!la were so much attached to Him that they would lie in bed· embracing 
Him, but as soon as the cocks crowed, Kr�!la 's wives would be very sorry 
and would immediately condemn the crowing. 
In the garden within the compound of each palace there were piirijiita 
flowers. Parijata is not an artificial flower. We remember that Kr�!la 
107 
108 
Kr�pa, the Supreme Personality of Godhead 
brought the piirijiita trees from heaven and implanted them in all His 
palaces. Early in the morning, a mild breeze would carry the aroma of the 
piirijiita flower, and Kr��a would smell it just after rising from bed. Due to 
this aroma, the honeybees would begin their humming vibration, and the 
birds also would begin their sweet chirping sounds. All together it would 
sound like the singing of professional chanters engaged in offering prayers 
to Kr��a. Although Srimati Rukmi�idevi, the first queen of Lord Kr��a, 
knew that briihma-muhiirta is the most auspicious time in the entire day, 
she would feel disgusted at the appearance of briihma-muhiirta because she 
was not very happy to have Kr��a leave her side in bed. Despite Srimati 
Rukmi�idevi's disgust, Lord Kr��a would immediately get up from bed 
exactly on the appearance of briihma-muhiirta. An ideal hous€holder 
should learn from the behavior of Lord Kr��a how to rise early in the 
morning, however comfortably he may be lying in bed embraced by his 
wife. 
After rising from bed, Lord Kr��a would wash His mouth, hands and 
feet and would immediately sit down and meditate on Himself. Tnis does 
not mean, however, that we should also sit down and meditate on ourselves. 
We have to meditate upon Kr��a, Radha-Kr��a. That is real meditation, 
Kr��a is Kr��a Himself; therefore He was teaching us that briihma-muhiirta 
should be utilized for meditation on Radha-Kr��a. By doing so, Kr��a 
would feel very much satisfied, and similarly we will also feel transcen­
dentally pleased and satisfied if we utilize the briihma-muhiirta period to 
meditate on Radha and Krwa and if we think of how Sri Rukmi�idevi and 
Kr��a acted as ideal householders to teach the whole human society to rise 
early in the morning and immediately engage in Kr��a consciousness. There 
is no difference between meditating on the eternal forms of Radha-Kr��a 
and chanting the mahiimantra, Hare Krwa. As for Kr��a's meditation, He 
had no alternative but to meditate on Himself. The object of meditation 
is Brahman, Paramatma or the Supreme Personality of Godhead, but 
Kr��a Himself is all three: He is the Supreme Personality of Godhead, 
Bhagavan; the localized Paramatma is His plenary parcel expansion; and the 
all-pervading Brahman effulgence is the personal rays of His transcendental 
body. Therefore Kr��a is always one, and for Him there is no differentia­
tion. That is the difference between an ordinary living being and Kr�l)a. 
For an ordinary living being there are many distinctions. An ordinary 
living being is different from his· body, and he is different from other 
species of living entities. A human being is different from other human 
beings and different from the animals. Even in his own body, there are 
different bodily limbs. We have our hands and legs, but our hands are 
Lord ���a's Daily Activities 
109 
different from our legs. The hand cannot act like the leg, nor can the leg 
act like the hand. The eyes cannot hear like the ears, nor can the ears see 
like the eyes. All these differences are technically called svajtiya vijtiya. 
The bodily limitation whereby one part of the body cannot act as 
another part is totally absent in the Supreme Personality of Godhead. 
There is no difference between His body and Himself. He is completely 
spiritual, and therefore there is no material difference between His body 
and His soul. Similarly, He is not different from His millions of incarnations 
and plenary expansions. Baladeva is the first expansion of K�!la, and from 
Baladeva expand Sa�kar�a!la, Vasudeva, Pradyumna and Aniruddha. From 
Sarikar�a!la there is again an expansion of Naraya!la, and from Naraya!la 
there is a second quadruple expansion of Sa!lkar�a!la, Vasudeva, Pradyumna 
and Aniruddha. Similarly there are innumerable expansions of Kr�!la, but 
all of them are one. Kr�!la has many incarnations, such as Lord Nrsimha, 
Lord, Boar, Lord Fish and Lord Tortoise, but there is no difference 
between Kr�!ia's original two-handed form, like that of a human being, 
and these incarnations of gigantic animal forms. Nor is there any difference. 
between the action of one part of His body and that of another. His hands 
can act as His legs, His eyes can act as His ears, or His nose can act as 
another part of His body. Kr�!la 's smelling and eating and hearing are all 
the same. We limited living entities have to use a particular part of our 
body for a particular purpose, but there is no such distinction for Kr�!la· 
In the Brahma-sarhhitii it is said, angiini yasya sakalendriya-vrtti: He can 
perform the activities of one limb with any other limb. So by analytical 
study of Kr�!la and His person, it is concluded that He is the complete 
whole. When He meditates, therefore, He meditates on Himself. The 
self-meditation by ordinary men, designated in Sanskrit as so'ham,is simply 
imitation. Kr�!la may meditate on Himself because He is the complete 
whole, but we cannot imitate Him and meditate on ourselves. Our body is 
a designation; Kr�!ia's body is not a designation. Kr�!ia's body is also 
Kr�!la· There is no existence of anything foreign in Kr�!la· 
Whatever 
there is in K�!la is also Kr�!la. He is therefore the supreme, indestructible 
complete existence, or the supreme truth. 
Krwa's existence is not relative existence. Everything else but Kr�!la is a 
relative truth, but Kr��a is the Supreme Absolute Truth. Kr��a does not 
depend on anything but Himself for His existence. Our existence, however 
is relative. For example, only when there is the light of the sun, the moon 
or electricity are we able to see. Our seeing, therefore, is relative, and the 
light of the sun and moon and electricity is also relative; they are called il­
luminating only because we see them as such. Dependence and relativity 
110 
��!'a, the Supreme Personality of Godhead 
do not exist in Kr�!J.a. His activities are not dependent on anyone else's 
appreciation, nor does He depend on anyone else's help. He is beyond the 
existence of limited time and space, and because He 'is transcendental to 
time and space, He cannot be covered by the illusion of miiyii, whose 
activities are limited. In the Vedic literature we find that the Supreme 
Personality of Godhead has multi-potencies. Since all such potencies are 
emanations from Him, there is no difference between Him and His poten­
cies. Certain philosophers say, however, that when Kr�!la comes He accepts 
a material body. But even if it is accepted that when He comes to the 
material world He accepts a material body, it should be concluded also 
that because the material energy is not different from Him, this body does 
not act materially. In the Bhagavad-gitii it is said, therefore, that He 
appears by His own internal potency, iitma-miiyii. 
Kr�!la is called the Supreme Brahman because He is the cause of creation, 
the cause of maintenance and the cause of dissolution. Lord Brahma, 
Lord Viwu and Lord Siva are different expansions of these material 
qualities. All these material qualities can act upon the conditioned souls, 
but there is no such action and reaction upon Kr�!la because these qualities 
are all simultaneously one and different from Him. Kr�!la Himself is simply 
sac-cid-iinanda-vigraha, the eternal form of bliss and knowledge, and 
because of His inconceivable greatness, He is called the Supreme Brahman. 
His meditation on Brahman or Paramatrna or Bhagavan is on Himself only 
and not on anything else beyond Himself. This meditation cannot be 
imitated by the ordinary living entity. 
After His meditation, the Lord would regularly bathe early in the 
morning with clear -sanctified water. Then He would change into fresh 
clothing, cover Himself with a wrapper and then engage Himself in His 
daily religious functions. Out of His many religious duties, the first was to 
off�r oblations into the sacrificial fire and silently chant the Gayatri mantra. 
Lord Kr�!J.a, as the ideal householder, executed all the religious functions 
of a householder without deviation. When the sunrise became visible, 
the Lord would offer specific prayers to the sun-god. The sun-god and 
other demigods mentioned in the Vedic scriptures are described as different 
limbs of the body of Lord Kr�!J.a, and it is the duty of the householder to 
offer respects to the demigods and great sages, as well as the forefathers. 
As it is said in the Bhagavad-gitii, The Lord has no specific duty to 
perform in this world, and yet He acts just like an ordinary man living an 
ideal life within this material world. In accordance with Vedic ritualistic 
principles, the Lord would offer respects to the demigods. The regulative 
principle by which the demigods and forefathers are worshiped is called 
Lord Kf��a's Daily Activities 
111 
tarpar-a, which means pleasing. One's forefathers might have to take a 
body on another planet, but by performance of this tarpar-a system, they 
become very happy wherever they may be. It is the duty of the house­
holder to make his family members happy, and by following this 'tarpar-a 
system he can make his forefathers happy also. As the perfect exemplary 
householder, Lord Sri Kr��a followed this tarpar-a system and offered 
respectful obeisances to the elderly superior members of His family. 
His next duty was to give cows in charity to the briihmar-as. Lord Kr��a 
used to give as many as 13,084 cows. Each of them was decorated with a 
silken cover and pearl necklace, their horns were covered with gold plating, 
and their hooves were silver-plated. All of them were full of milk, due to 
having their first-born calves with them, and they were very- tame and 
peaceful. When the cows were given in charity to the briihmar-as, the 
briihmar-as also were given nice silken garments, and each was given a deer­
skin and sufficient quantity of sesame grains. The Lord is generally known 
as go-briihmar-a-hitiiya ca, which means that His first duty is to see to the 
welfare of the cows and the briihmar-as. Thus He used to give cows in 
charity to the briihmar-as, with opulent decorations and paraphernalia. 
Then, wishing for the welfare of all living entities, He would touch aus­
picious articles such as milk, fire, honey, ghee (clarified butter), gold, 
jewels and fire. Although the Lord is by nature very beautiful due to the 
perfect figure of His transcendental body, still He would dress Himself in 
yellow colored garments and put on His necklace of Kaustubha jewels. 
He would wear flower garlands, smear His body with the pulp of sandal­
wood and decorate Himself with other similar cosmetics and ornaments. 
It is said that the ornaments themselves became beautiful upon being 
placed on the transcendental body of the Lord. After decorating Himself 
in this way, the Lord would then look at marble statues of the cow and 
calf and visit temples of God or demigods like Lord Siva. There were many 
briihmar-as who would come daily to see the Supreme Lord before taking 
their breakfast; they were anxious to see Him, and He welcomed them. 
His next duty was to please all kinds of men belonging to the different 
castes, both in the city and within the palace compound. He made them 
happy by fulfilling their different desires, and when the Lord saw them 
happy He also became very much pleased. The flower garlands, betel nuts, 
sandalwood pulp and other fragrant cosmetic articles which were offered 
to the Lord would be distributed by Him, first to the briihmar-as and 
elderly members of the family, then to the queens, then to the ministers, 
and if there were still some balance He would utilize it for His own personal 
use. By the time the Lord finished all these daily duties and activities, 
112 
Kr�!J.a, the Supreme Personality of Godhead 
His charioteer Daruka would come with His wonderful chariot to stand 
before the Lord with folded hands, intimating that the chariot was ready, 
and the Lord would come out of the palace to travel. Then the Lord, ac­
companied by U ddhava and Satyaki, would ride on the chariot just as the 
sun-god rides on his chariot in the morning, appearing with his blazing 
rays on the surface of the world. When the Lord was about to leave His 
palaces, all the queens would look at Him with feminine gestures. The Lord 
would respond to their greetings with smiles, attracting their hearts so 
much so that they would feel intense separation from the Lord. 
Then the Lord would go to the assembly house known as Sudharma. It 
may be remembered that the Sudharma assembly house was taken away 
from the heavenly planet and was reestablished in the city of Dvaraka. The 
specific significance of the assembly house was that anyone who entered 
it would be freed from the six kinds of material pangs, namely hunger, 
thirst, lamentation, illusion, old age and death. These are the webs of 
material existence, and as long as one remained in that assembly house of 
Sudharma he would not be infected by these six material webs. The Lord 
would say good-bye in all the sixteen thousand palaces, and again He 
would become one and enter the Sudharma assembly house in procession 
with other members of the Yadu dynasty. After entering the assembly 
house, He used to sit on the exalted royal throne and would be seen to 
emanate glaring rays of transcendental effulgence. In the midst of all the 
great heroes of the Yadu dynasty, Kr�!la resembled the full moon in the 
sky, surrounded by multi-luminaries. In the assembly house there were 
professional jokers, dancers, musicians and ballet girls, and as soon as the 
Lord sat on His throne, they would begin their respective functions in 
order to please the Lord and put Him in a happy mood. First of all the 
jokers would talk in such a way that the Lord and His associates would 
enjoy their humor which would refresh the morning mood. The dramatic 
actors would then play their parts, and the dancing ballet girls would 
separately display their artistic movements. All these functions would be 
accompanied by the beating of mrdanga drums and the sounds of the 
vir-a and flutes and bells, followed by the sound of the piikhvaj, another 
type of drum. Along with these musical vibrations, the auspicious sound 
of the conchshell would also be added. The professional singers called 
siltas and miigadhas would sing, and others would perform their dancing 
art. In this way, as devotees, they would offer respectful prayers to the 
Supreme Personality of Godhead. Sometimes the learned briihmar-as pre­
sent in that assembly would chant Vedic hymns and explain them to the 
audience to their best knowledge, and sometimes some of them would 
Lord Kr�!ia's Daily Activities 
113 
recite old historical accounts of the activities of prominent kings. The 
Lord, accompanied by His associates, would be very much pleased to hear 
them. 
Once upon a time, a person arrived at the gateway of the assembly 
house who was unknown to all the members of the assembly, and with the 
permission of Lord Kr�!la he was admitted into the assembly by the door­
keeper. The doorkeeper was ordered to present him before the Lord, and 
the man appeared and offered his respectful obeisances unto the Lord 
with folded hands. It had happened that when King Jarasandha conquered 
all other kingdoms many kings did not bow their heads before J arasandha, 
and as a result of this all of them, numbering twenty thousand, were 
arrested and made his prisoners. The man who was brought before Lord 
Krwa by the doorkeeper was a representative messenger from all these 
imprisoned kings. Being duly presented before the Lord, the man began to 
explain the actual situation as follows: 
"My dear Lord, You are the eternal form of transcendental bliss and 
knowledge. As such, You are beyond the reach of the mental speculation 
or vocal description of any materialistic man within this world. A slight 
portion of Your glories can be known by persons who are fully surrendered 
unto Your lotus feet, and by Your grace only such persons become freed 
from all material anxieties. My dear Lord, I am not one of these surrendered 
souls; I am still within the duality and illusion of this material existence. 
I have therefore come to take shelter of Your lotus feet, for I am afraid 
of the cycle of birth and death. My dear Lord, I think that there are many 
living entities like me who are eternally entangled in fruitive activities and 
their resultant reactions. They are never inclined to follow Your instruc­
tions by performance of devotional service, although it is pleasing to the 
heart and most auspicious for one's existence. On the contrary, they are 
against the path of Kr�!la conscious life, and they are wandering within 
the three worlds impelled by the illusory energy of material existence. 
"My dear Lord, who can estimate Your mercy and Your powerful 
activities? You are present always as the insurmountable force of eternal 
time, engaged in baffling the indefatigable desires ofthe materialists, who 
are thus repeatedly becoming confused and frustrated. I therefore offer 
my respectful obeisances unto You in Your form of eternal time. My 
dear Lord, You are the proprietor of all the worlds, and You have in­
carnated Yourself along with Your plenary expansion Lord Balarama. 
It is said that Your appearance in this incarnation is for the purpose of 
protecting the faithful and destroying the miscreants. Under the circum­
stances, how is it possible that miscreants like Jarasandha can put us into 
114 
Kr�pa, the Supreme Personality of Godhead 
such deplorable conditions of life against Your authority? We are puzzled 
at the situation and cannot understand how it is possible. It may be that 
J arasandha has been deputed to give us such trouble because of our past 
misdeeds, but we have heard from revealed scriptures that anyone who 
surrenders unto Your lotus feet immediately becomes immuned to the 
reactions of sinful life. I have therefore been deputed by all the imprisoned 
kings to whole-heartedly offer ourselves unto Your shelter, and we hope 
that Your Lordship will now give us full protection. We have now come to 
the real conclusion of our lives. Our kingly positions are nothing but the 
reward of our past pious activities, just as our suffering imprisonment by 
Jarasandha is the result of our past impious activities. We realize now 
that the resultant reactions of both pious and impious activities are 
temporary and that we can never be happy in this conditioned life. This 
material body is awarded to us by the modes of material nature, and on 
account of this we are full of anxieties. The material condition of life simply 
involves bearing the burden of this dead body. As a result of fruitive 
activities we have thus been subjected to being beasts of burden for these 
bodies, and being forced by conditional life, we have given up the pleasing 
life of Kr��a consciousness .. Now we realize that we are the most foolish 
persons. We have been entangled in the network of material reaction due 
to our ignorance. We have therefore come to the shelter of Your lotus 
feet, which can immediately eradicate all the results of fruitive action and 
thus free us from the contamination of material pains and pleasures. 
Dear Lord, because we are now surrendered souls at Your lotus feet, 
You can give us relief from the entrapment of fruitive action made 
possible by the form of J arasandha. Dear Lord, it is known to You that 
J arasandha possesses the power of ten thousand elephants, and with this 
power he has imprisoned us, just as a lion hypnotizes a flock of sheep. 
My dear Lord, You have already fought with J arasandha eighteen times 
consecutively, out of which You have defeated him seventeen times by 
surpassing his extraordinary powerful position. But in Your eighteenth 
fight, You exhibited Your human behavior, and thus it appeared that You 
were defeated. My dear Lord, we know very well that J arasandha cannot 
defeat You at any time because Your power, strength, resources and 
authority are all unlimited. No one can equal You or surpass You. The 
appearance of defeat by J arasandha in the eighteenth engagement is nothing 
but an exhibition of human behavior. Unfortunately, foolish Jarasandha 
could not understand Your tricks, and he has since then become puffed up 
over his material power and prestige. Specifically, he has arrested us and 
imprisoned us, knowing fully that as Your devotees, we are subordinate to 
Your sovereignty.

"Now I have explained our awful position, and Your Lordship can 
consider and do whatever You like. As the messenger and representative of 
all those imprisoned kings, I have submitted my words before Your 
Lordship and presented our prayers to You. All the kings are very anxious 
to see You so that they can all personally surrender at Your lotus feet. 
My dear Lord, be merciful upon them and act for their good fortune." 
At the very moment the messenger of the imprisoned kings was 
presenting his appeal before the Lord, the great sage Narada also arrived. 
Because he was a great saint, his hair was dazzling like gold, and when he 
entered the assembly house it appeared that the sun-god was personally 
present in the midst of the assembly. Lord Kr��a is the worshipable 
master of even Lord Brahma and Lord Siva, yet as soon as He saw that the 
sage Narada had arrived, He immediately stood up along with His ministers 
and secretaries to receive the great sage and offer His respectful obeisances 
by bowing His head. The great sage Narada took a comfortable seat, and 
Lord Kr��a worshiped him with all paraphernalia, as required for the 
regular reception of a saintly person. While He was trying to satisfy 
Naradaji, Lord Kr��a spoke the following words in His sweet and natural 
VOICe. 
"My dear great sage among the demigods, I think that now everything 
is well within the three worlds. You are perfectly eligible to travel 
everywhere in space in the upper, middle and lower planetary systems of 
this universe. Fortunately, when we meet you we can very easily take 
information from your holiness of all the news of the three worlds; 
witl�in this cosmic manifestation of the Supreme Lord, there is nothing 
concealed from your knowledge. You know everything, and so I wish to 
question you. Are the Pa��avas doing well, and what is the present plan of 
King Yudhi�thira? Will you kindly let Me know what they want to do at 
present?" 
The great sage Narada spoke as follows: "My dear Lord, You have 
spoken about the cosmic manifestation created by the Supreme Lord, but 
I know that You are the all-pervading creator. Your energies are so 
extensive and inconceivable that even powerful personalities like Brahma, 
the lord of this particular universe, cannot measure Your inconceivable 
power. My dear Lord, You are present as the Supersoul in everyone's 
heart by Your inconceivable potency, exactly like the fire which is present 
in everyone but which no one can see directly. In conditioned life, every 
living entity is within the jurisdiction of the three modes of material 
nature. As such, they are unable to see Your presence everywhere with 
their material eyes. By Your grace, however, I have seen many times the 
116 
Kf�l)a, the Supreme Personality of Godhead 
action of Your inconceivable potency, and therefore when You ask me for 
news of the Pii!J.�avas, which is not at all unknown to You, I am not 
surprised at Your inquiry. My dear Lord, by Your inconceivable potencies 
You create this cosmic manifestation, maintain it and again dissolve it. It 
is by dint of Your inconceivable potency only that this material world, 
although a shadow representation of the spiritual world, appears to be 
factual. No one can understand what You plan to do in the future. Your 
transcendental position is always inconceivable to everyone. As far as I am 
concerned, I can simply offer my respectful obeisances unto You again 
and again. In the bodily concept of knowledge, everyone is driven by 
material desires, and thus everyone develops new material bodies one after 
another in the cycle of birth and death. Being absorbed in such a concept 
of existence, one does not know how to get out of this encagement of the 
material body. Out of Your causeless mercy, my Lord, You descend to 
exhibit Your different transcendental pastimes, which are illuminating 
and full of glory. Therefore I have no alternative but to offer my 
respectful obeisances unto You. My dear Lord, You are the supreme 
Parambrahman, and Your pastimes as an ordinary human are another 
tactical resource, exactly like a play on the stage in which the actor. plays 
parts different from his own identity. You have inquired about Your 
cousins the Pli!J.�avas in the role of their well-wisher, and therefore I shall 
let You know about their intentions. Now please hear me. First of all may 
I inform You that King Yudhi�thira has all material opulences which are 
possible to achieve in the highest planetary system, Brahmaloka. He has 
no mateirla opulence for which to aspire, and yet he wants to perform 
Rajasuya sacrifices only to get Your association and please You. 
Narada informed Lord Kr1!J.a, "King Yudhi�thira is so opulent that he 
has attained all the opulences of Brahmaloka even ori this earthly planet. 
He is fully satisfied, and he does not need anything more. He is full in 
everything, but now he wants to worship You in order to achieve Your 
causeless mercy, and I beg to request You to fulfill his desires. My dear 
Lord, in these great sacrificial performances by King YudhiHhira there will 
be an assembly of all the demigods and all the famous kings of the world. 
"My dear Lord, You are the Supreme Brahman, Personality of Godhead. 
One who engages himself in Your devotional service by the prescribed 
methods of hearing, chanting and remembering certainly becomes purified 
from the contamination of the modes of material nature, and what to 
speak of those who have the opportunity to see You and touch You 
directly. My dear Lord, You are the symbol of everything auspicious. 
Your transct.:ndental name and fame have spread all over the universe, 
Lord Kf�l)a's Daily Activities 
117 
including the higher, middle and lower planetary systems. The transcen­
dental water which washes Your lotus feet is known in the higher 
planetary system as Mandakini, in the lower planetary system as Bhogavati, 
and in this earthly planetary system as the Ganges. This sacred, transcen­
dental water flows throughout the entire universe, purifying wherever it 
flows." 
Just before the great sage Narada arrived in the Sudharma assembly 
house of Dvaraka, Lord Kr�I)a and His ministers and secretaries had been 
considering how to attack the kingdom of J arasandha. Because they were 
seriously considering this subject, Narada's proposal that Lord Kr�p.a go 
to Hastinapura for Maharaja Yudhi�thira's great Rajasuya sacrifice did not 
much appeal to them. Lord Kf�I)a could understand the intentions of his 
associates because He is the ruler of even Lord Brahma. Therefore, in order 
to pacify them, He smilingly said. to Uddhava, "My dear Uddhava, you are 
always my well-wishing confidential friend. I therefore wish to see every­
thing through you because I believe that your counsel is always right. I 
believe that you understand the whole situation perfectly. Therefore I am 
asking your opinion. What should I do? I have faith in you, and therefore 
I shall do whatever you advise." It was known to Uddhava that although 
Lord Kr�I)a was acting like an ordinary man, He knew everything-past, 
present and future. However, because the Lord was trying to consult with 
him, U ddhava, in order to render service to the Lord, began to speak. 
Thus ends the Bhaktivedanta purport of the Second Volume, Fifteenth 
Chapter, of Kr�p.a, "Lord K[§!la's Daily Activities." 
16 I Lord Kr��a in lndraprastha City 
In the presence of the great sage Narada and all the other associates of 
Lord Kr�pa, Uddhava considered the situation and then spoke as follows: 
"My dear Lord, first of all let me say that the great sage Narada Muni 
has requested You to go to Hastinapura to satisfy King Yudhi�thira, 
your cousin, who is making arrangements to perform the great sacrifice 
known as Rajasiiya. I think, therefore, that Your Lordship should im­
mediately go there to help the King in this great adventure. However, 
although to accept the invitation offered by the sage Narada Muni as 
primary is quite appropriate, at the same time, my Lord, it is Your duty 
to give protection to the surrendered souls. Both purposes can be served 
if we understand the whole situation. Unless we are victorious over all the 
kings, no one can perform this Rajasiiya sacrifice. In other words, it is to 
be understood that King Yudhi�thira canhot perform this great sacrifice 
without gaining victory over the belligerent King J arasandha. The Rajasiiya 
sacrifice can only be performed by one who has gained victory over all 
directions. Therefore, to execute both purposes, we first of all have to kill 
J arasandha. I think that if we can somehow or other gain victory over 
J arasandha, then automatically all our purposes will be served. The 
imprisoned kings will be released, and with great pleasure we shall enjoy 
the spread of Your transcendental fame at having saved the innocent 
kings whom Jarasandha has imprisoned. 
"But King Jarasandha is not an ordinary man. He has proved a stumbling 
block even to great warriors because his bodily strength is equal to the 
strength of 10,000 elephants. If there is anyone who can conquer this king, 
he is none other than Bhimasena because he also possesses the strength of 
10,000 elephants. The best thing would be for Bhimasena to fight alone 
with him. Then there would be no unnecessary killing of many soldiers. 
In fact, it will be very difficult to conquer Jarasandha when he stands with 
118 
Lord Kr��a in Indraprastha City 
119 
his ak§auhir-i divisions of soldiers. We may therefore adopt a policy more 
favorable to the situation. We know that King J arasandha is very much 
devoted to the briihmar-as. He is very charitably disposed towards them; 
he never refuses any request from a briihmar-a. I think, therefore, that 
Bhimasena should approach Jarasandha in the dress of a briihmar-a, beg 
charity from Him, and then personally engage in fighting Him. And in 
order to assure Bhimasena's victory, I think that Your Lordship should 
also accompany him. If the fighting takes place in Your presence, I am 
sure Bhimasena will emerge victorious because simply by Your presence 
everything impossible is made possible, just as Lord Brahma creates this 
universe and Lord Siva destroys it simply through Your influence. 
"Actually, You are creating and destroying the entire cosmic manifesta­
tion; Lord Brahma and Lord Siva are only the superficially visible causes. 
Creation and destruction are actually being performed by the invisible time 
factor, which is Your impersonal representation. Everything is under the 
control of this time factor. If Your invisible time factor can perform such 
wonderful acts through Lord Brahma and Lord Siva, will not Your 
personal presence help Bhimasena to conquer Jarasandha? My dear Lord, 
when Jarasandha is killed, then the queens of all the imprisoned kings will 
be so joyful at their husbands' being released by Your mercy that they will 
all begin to sing Your glories. They will be as pleased as the gopis were 
when they were relieved from the hands of Sarikhasura. All the great sages, 
the King of the elephants, Gajendra, the goddess of fortune, Sita, and 
even Your father and mother, were all delivered by Your causeless mercy. 
We also have been thus delivered, and we are always singing the transcen­
dental glories of Your activities. 
"Therefore, I think that if the killing of J arasandha is undertaken first, 
that will automatically solve many o�her problems. As for the Rajasuya 
sacrifice arranged in Hastinapura, it will be held, either because of the 
pious activities of the imprisoned kings or the impious activities of 
J arasandha. 
"My Lord, it appears that You are also personally to go to Hastinapura 
to perform this great sacrifice so that demoniac kings like J arasandha and 
Sisupala may be conquered, the pious imprisoned kings released, and at 
the same time the great Rajasuya sacrifice performed. Considering all 
these points, I think that Your Lordship should immediately proceed to 
Hastinapura." 
This advice of U ddhava's was appreciated by all who were present in the 
assembly, and everyone considered that Lord Kr��a 's going to Hastinapura 
would be beneficial from all points of view. The great sage Narada, the 
120 
Kf�J)a, the Supreme Personality of Godhead 
elderly personalities of the Y adu dynasty, and the Supreme Personality of 
Godhead Kr��a Himself all supported the statement of U ddhava. Lord 
Kr��a then took permission from His father Vasudeva and grandfather 
Ugrasena, and He immediately ordered His servants Daruka and Jaitra to 
arrange for travel to Hastinapura. When everything was prepared, Lord 
Kr��a especially bid farewell to Lord Balarama and the King of the Y adus, 
U grasena, and after dispatching His queens along with their children and 
sending their necessary luggage ahead, He mounted His chariot, which bore 
the flag marked with the symbol of Garu�a. 
Before starting the procession, Lord Kr��a satisfied the great sage 
Narada by offering him different kinds of worshipable articles. Naradaji 
wanted to fall at the lotus feet of Kr��a, but because the Lord was playing 
the part of a human being, he simply offered his respects within his mind, 
and fixing the transcendental form of the Lord within his heart, he left 
the assembly house by the airways. Usually the sage Narada never walks on 
the surface of the globe, but travels in outer space. After the departure of 
Narada, Lord Kr��a addressed the messenger who had come from the 
imprisoned kings. He told him that they should not be worried. He would 
very soon arrange to kill the King of Magadha, J arasandha. Thus He wished 
good fortune to all the imprisoned kings and the messenger. After receiving 
this assurance from Lord Kr��a, the messenger returned to the imprisoned 
kings and informed them of the happy news of the Lord's forthcoming 
visit. All the kings became joyful at the news and began to wait very 
anxiously for the Lord's arrival. 
The chariot of Lord Kr��a began to proceed, accompanied by many 
other chariots, along with elephants, cavalry, infantry and similar royal para­
phernalia. Bugles, drums, trumpets, conchshells, horns and coronets all 
began to produce a loud auspicious sound which vibrated in all directions. 
The 16,000 queens, headed by the goddess of fortune Rukmi�idevi, the 
ideal wife of Lord Kr��a, and accompanied by their respective sons, all 
followed behind Lord Kr��a. They �ere dressed in costly garments 
decorated with ornaments, and their bodies were smeared with sandalwood 
pulp and garlanded with fragrant flowers. Riding on palanquins which were 
nicely decorated with silks, flags, and golden lace, they followed their 
exalted husband, Lord Kr��a. The infantry soldiers carried shields, swords 
and lances in their hands and acted as royal bodyguards to the queens. In 
the rear of the procession were the wives and children of all the other 
followers, and there were many society girls also following. Many beasts 
of burden like bulls, buffaloes, mules, and asses carried the camps, bedding 
and carpets, and the women who were following were seated in separate 
Lord Kr��a in lndraprastha City 
121 
palanquins on the backs of camels. This panoramic procession was accom­
panied by the shouts of the people and was full with the display of dif­
ferent colored flags, umbrellas and whisks and different varieties of 
weapons, dress, ornaments, helmets and armaments. The procession, being 
reflected in the sunshine, appeared just like an ocean with high waves and 
sharks. 
In this way the procession of Lord Kr�!la's party advanced towards 
Hastinapura (New Delhi) and gradually passed through the kingdoms of 
Anarta (Gujarat Province), Sauvira (Sauret), the great desert of Rajasthan, 
and then Kuruk�etra. In between those kingdoms there were many moun-_ 
tains, rivers, towns, villages, pasturing grounds and mining fields. The 
procession passed through all of these places in its advance. On His way to 
Hastinapura, the Lord crossed two big rivers, the Dr�vati and the Sarasvati 
Then He crossed the province of Pafichala and the province of Matsya. In 
this way, ultimately He arrived at Indraprastha. 
The audience of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Kr��a, is not very 
commonplace. Therefore, when King Yudhi�thira heard that Lord Kr�!la 
had already arrived in his capital city, Hastinapura, he became so joyful 
that all his hairs stood on end in great ecstasy, and he immediately came 
out of the city to properly receive Him. He ordered the musical vibration 
of different instruments and songs, and the learned briihmar-as of the city 
began to chant the hymns of the Vedas very loudly. Lord Kr��a is known 
as Hr�ike8a, the master of the senses, and King Yudhi�thira went forward 
to receive Him exactly as the senses meet the consciousness of life. King 
Yudhi�thira was the elderly cousin of Kr�!la. Naturally he had great affec­
tion for the Lord, and as soon as he saw Him, his heart became filled with 
great love and affection. He had not seen the Lord for many days, and 
therefore he thought himself most fortunate to see Him present before 
him. The King therefore began to embrace Lord Kr��a again and again in 
great affection. 
The eternal form of Lord Kr�!la is the everlasting residence of the 
goddess of fortune. As soon as King Yudhi�thira embraced Him, he became 
free from all the contamination of material existence. He immediately felt 
transcendental bliss, and he merged in an ocean of happiness. There were 
tears in his eyes, and his body shook due to ecstasy. He completely forgot 
that he was living in this material world. After this, Bhimasena, the secopd 
brother of the Pa!l-9-avas, smiled and embraced Lord Kr�Ifa, thinking of 
Him as his own maternal cousin, and thus he was merged in great ecstasy. 
Bhimasena also was so filled with ecstasy that for the time being he forgot 
his material existence. Then Lord Sri Kr�!la Himself embraced the other 
122 
Kr��a, the Supreme Personality of Godhead 
three Pa��avas, Arjuna, N akula and Sahadeva. The eyes of all three 
brothers were inundated with tears, and Arjuna began to embrace Kr�!la 
again and again because they were intimate friends. The two younger 
Pa!l�ava brothers, after being embraced by Lord Kr�!la, fell down at His 
lotus feet to offer their respects. Lord Kr�!la thereafter offered His 
obeisances to the b riihma1;zas present there, as well as to the elderly 
members of the Kuru dynasty, like Bhi�ma, Dro�a and Dhrtara�tra. There 
were many kings of different provinces such as Kuru, Srnjaya and Kekaya, 
and Lord Kr�!la duly reciprocated greetings and respects with them. The 
professional reciters like the siitas, miigadhas, and vandinas, accompanied 
by the briihmar-as, began to offer their respectful prayers to the Lord. 
Artists and musicians like the Gandharvas, as well as the royal jokers, began 
to play their drums, conchshells, kettledrums, vir-as, mrdaiigas, and bugles, 
and they exhibited their dancing art in order to please the Lord. Thus the 
all-famous Supreme Personality of Godhead, Lord Kr�!la, entered the great 
city of Hastinapura, which was opulent in every respect. While Lord Kr�!la 
was entering the city, everyone was talking amongst themselves about the 
glories of the Lord, praising His transcendental name, quality, form, etc. 
The roads, streets and lanes of Hastinapura were all sprinkled with 
fragrant water through the trunks of intoxicated elephants. In different 
places of the city there were colorful festoons and flags decorating the 
houses and streets. At important road crossings there were gates with 
golden decorations, and at the two sides of the gates there were golden 
water jugs. These beautiful decorations glorified the opulence of the city. 
Participating in this great ceremony, all the citizens of the city gathered 
here and there, dressed in colorful new clothing, decorated with ornaments, 
flower garlands, and fragrant scents. Each and every house was illuminated 
by hundreds and thousands of lamps placed in different corners of the 
cornices, walls, columns, bases and architraves, and from far away the 
rays of the lamps resembled the festival of Dipavali (a particular festival 
observed on the New Year's Day of the Hindu calendar). Within the walls 
of the houses, fragrant incense was burning, and smoke rose through the 
windows, making the entire atmosphere very pleasing. On the top of every 
house flags were flapping, and the gold water pots kept on the roofs shone 
very brilliantly. 
Lord Kr�!la thus entered the city of the Pa��avas, enjoyed the beautiful 
atmosphere and slowly proceeded ahead. When the young girls in every 
house heard that Lord Krwa, the only object worth seeing, was passing on 
the road, they became very anxious to see this all-famous personality. Their 
hair loosened, and their tightened saris became slack due to their hastily 
Lord Kr��a in lndraprastha City 
123 
rushing to see Him. They gave up their household engagements, and those 
who were lying in bed with their husbands immediately left them and 
came directly down onto the street to see Lord Kr�!la· 
The procession of elephants, horses, chariots, and infantry was very 
crowded; some, being unable to see properly in the crowd, got up on the 
roofs of the houses. They were pleased to see Lord Sri Kr�!la passing with 
His thousands of queens. They began to shower flowers on the procession, 
and they embraced Lord Kr�!la within their minds and gave Him a hearty 
reception. When they saw Him in the midst of His many queens, like the 
full moon situated amidst many luminaries, they began to talk amongst 
themselves. 
One girl said to another, "My dear friend, it is very difficult to guess 
what kind of pious activities these queens might have performed, for they 
are always enjoying the smiling face and loving glances of Kr�!la." While 
Lord Kr�!la was thus passing on the road, at intervals some of the opulent 
citizens, who were all rich, respectable and freed from sinful activities 
presented auspicious articles to the Lord, just to offer Him a reception to 
the city. Thus they worshiped Him as humble servitors. 
When Lord Kr�!la entered the palace, all the ladies there became over­
whelmed with affection just upon seeing Him. They immediately received 
Lord Kr�!la with glittering eyes expressing their love and affection for 
Him, and Lord Kr�!la smiled and accepted their feelings and gestures of 
reception. When Kunti, the mother of the Pa��avas, saw her nephew Lord 
Kr�!la, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, she became overpowered 
with love and affection. She at once got up from her bedstead and appeared 
before Him with her daughter-in-law, Draupadi, and in maternal love and 
affection she embraced Him. As he brought Kr�!la within the palace, King 
Yudhi�thira became so confused in his jubilation that he practically forgot 
what he was to do at that time in order to receive Kr�!la and worship Him 
properly. Lord Krwa delightfully offered His respects and obeisances to 
Kunti and other elderly ladies of the palace. His younger sister, Subhadra, 
was also standing there with Draupadi, and both offered their respectful 
obeisances unto the lotus feet of the Lord. At the indication of her mother­
in-law, Draupadi brought clothing, ornaments and garlands, and with this 
paraphernalia they received the queens Rukmi�i, Satyabhama, Bhadra, 
Jambavati, Kalindi, Mitravinda, Lak�ma!la and the devoted Satya. These 
principal queens of Lord Kr�!la were first received, and then the remaining 
queens were also offered a proper reception. King Yudhi§thira arranged 
for Kr�!ia's rest and saw that all who came along with Him-namely His 
queens, His soldiers, His ministers and His secretaries-were comfortably 
I 
124 
Kr�pa, the Supreme Personality of Godhead 
situated. He had arranged that they would experience a new feature of 
reception everyday while staying as guests of the Patt9avas. 
It was during this time that Lord Sri Kr§tta, with the help of Arjuna, for 
the satisfaction of the fire-god, Agni, allowed Agni to devour the 
Khap9ava Forest. During the forest fire, Krwa saved the demon Mayasura, 
who was hiding in the forest. Upon being saved, Mayasura felt obliged to 
the Patt9avas and Lord Kr§pa, and he constructed a wonderful assembly 
house within the city of Hastinapura. In this way, Lord Kr§tta, in order to 
please King Yudhi§thira, remained in the city of Hastinapura for several 
months. During His stay, He enjoyed strolling here and there. He used to 
drive on chariots along with Arjuna, and many warriors and soldiers used 
to follow them.

, 
Chapter, of Kr§tta, "Lord KrHta in Indrapras tha City."

1 7 I Liberation of King J arasandha 
In the great assembly of respectable persons, citizens, friends, relatives, 
briihmaras, k§atriyas and vaisyas, King Yudhi�!hira, in the presence of all, 
including his brothers, directly addressed Lord Kr�!la as follows: "My dear 
Lord Krwa, the sacrifice known as the Rajasiiya yaji'ia is to be performed· 
by the emperor, and it is considered to be the king of all sacrifices. By 
performing this sacrifice, I wish to satisfy all the demigods, who are Your 
empowered representatives within this material world, and I wish that 
You will kindly help me in this great adventure so that it may be success­
fully executed. As far as the Pal}�avas are concerned, we have nothing to 
ask from the demigods. We are personally fully satisfied by being Your 
devotees. As You say in the Bhagavad-gitii, "Persons who are bewildered 
by material desires worship the demigods," but our purpose is different. 
I want to perform this Rajasiiya sacrifice and invite the demigods to show 
them that they have no power independent of You. They are all Your 
servants, and You are the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Foolish persons 
with a poor fund of knowledge consider Your Lordship an ordinary human 
being. Sometimes they try to find fault in You, and sometimes they 
defame You. Therefore I wish to perform this Rajasiiya yaji'ia. I wish to 
invite all the demigods, beginning from Lord Brahma, Lord Siva and other 
exalted chiefs of the heavenly planets, and in that great assembly of 
demigods from all parts of the universe, I want to substantiate that You 
are the Supreme Personality of Godhead and that everyone is Your servant. 
"My dear Lord, those who are constantly in Kr�!la consciousness and 
who think of Your lotus feet or of Your shoes certainly become free from 
all contamination of material life. Persons who are engaged in Your service 
in full Kr�tla consciousness, who meditate upon You only or who offer 
prayers unto You, are purified souls. Being constantly engaged in Kr�tla 
conscious service, such persons become freed from th�cycle of repeated 
125 
' 
) 
126 
Kr�t;�a, the Supreme Personality of Godhead 
birth and death. They do not even desire to become freed from this 
material existence or to enjoy material opulences; their desires are fulfilled 
by Kr�t;�a conscious activities. As far as we are concerned, we are fully 
surrendered unto Your lotus feet, and by Your grace we are so fortunate to 
see You personally. Therefore, naturally we have no desire for material 
opulences. The verdict of the Vedic wisdom is that You are the Supreme 
Personality of Godhead. I want to establish this fact, and I also want to 
show the world the difference between accepting You as the Supreme 
Personality of Godhead and accepting You as an ordinary powerful histori­
cal person. I wish to show the world that one can attain the highest 
perfection of life simply by taking shelter at Your lotus feet, exactly as 
one can satisfy the branches, twigs, leaves and flowers of an entire tree 
simply by watering the root. Thus, if one takes to Kr�.pa consciousness, 
his life becomes fulfilled both materially and spiritually. 
"This does not mean that You are partial to the Kr�.pa conscious person 
and are indifferent to the non-Kr�.pa conscious person. You are equal to 
everyone; that is Your declaration. You cannot be partial to one and not 
interested in others because You are sitting in everyone's heart as the 
Supersoul and giving everyone the respective results of his fruitive activi­
ties. You give every living entity the chance to enjoy this material world 
as he desires. As Supersoul, You are sitting in the body along with the 
living entity, giving him the results of his own actions as well as oppor­
tunities to turn toward Your devotional service by developing Kr�.pa 
consciousness. You openly declare that one should surrender unto You, 
giving up all other engagements, and that You will take charge of him, 
giving him relief from the reactions of all sins. You are like the desire tree 
in the heavenly planets, which awards benediction according to one's 
desires. Everyone is free to achieve the highest perfection, but if one does 
not so desire, then Your awarding of lesser benedictions is not due to 
partiality." 
On hearing this statement of King Yudhi�thira, Lord Kr�.pa replied as 
follows: "My dear King Yudhi§thira, 0 killer of enemies, 0 ideal justice 
personified, I completely support your decision to perform the Rajasiiya 
sacrifice. By performing this great sacrifice, your good name will remain 
well established forever in the history of human civilization. My dear King, 
may I inform you that it is the desire of all great sages, your forefathers, 
the demigods, and your relatives and friends, including Myself, that you 
perform this sacrifice, and I think that it will satisfy every living entity. 
But, because it is necessary, I request that you first of all conquer all the 
kings of the world and collect all requisite paraphernalia for executing this 
Liberation of King Jarasandha 
127 
great sacrifice. My dear King Yudhi§thira, your four brothers are direct 
representatives of important demigods like Varu�a, Indra, etc. [It is said 
that Bhima was born of the demigod V aru�a, and Arjuna was born of the 
demigod Indra, whereas King Yudhi§thira himself was born of the demi­
god Y amaraja.] Your brothers are great heroes, and you are the most pious 
and self-controlled king and are therefore known as Dharmaraja. All of 
you are so qualified in devotional service unto Me that automatically I 
have become rivalled by you." 
Lord Kf§�a told King Yudhi§thira that He becomes conquered by the 
love of one who has conquered his senses. One who has not conquered his 
senses cannot conquer the Supreme Personality of Godhead. This is the 
secret of devotional service. To conquer the senses means to engage them 
constantly in the service of the Lord. The specific qualification of all the 
Pa��ava brothers was that they always engaged their senses in the service 
of the Lord. One who thus engages his senses becomes purified, and with 
purified senses one can actually render service to the Lord. The Lord can 
thus be conquered by the devotee by lovingtranscendental service. 
Lord Kr§�a continued: "There is no one in the three worlds of the 
universe, including the powerful demigods, who can surpass My devotees 
in any of the six opulences, namely, wealth, strength, reputation, beauty, 
knowledge and renunciation. Therefore, if you want to conquer the world­
ly kings, there is no possibility of their emerging victorious." 
When Lord Kr§�a thus encouraged King Yudhi§thira, the King's face 
brightened like a blossoming flower because of transcendental happiness, 
and thus he ordered his younger brothers to conquer all the worldly king.s 
in all directions. Lord Krwa empowered the Pa��avas to execute His 
great mission of chastising the infidel miscreants of the world and giving 
protection to His faithful devotees. In His Vi§�U form, the Lord therefore 
carries four kinds of weapons in His four hands. He carries a lotus flower 
and a conchshell in two hands, and in the other two hands He carries a 
club and a disc. The club and disc are meant for the nondevotees, but 
because the Lord is the Supreme Absolute, the resultant action of all His 
weapons is one and the same. With the club and the disc He chastises the 
miscreants so that they may come to their senses and know that they are 
not all in all. Over them there is the Supreme Lord. And by bugling with 
the conchshell and by offering blessings with the lotus flower, He always 
assures the devotees that no one can vanquish them, even in the greatest 
calamity. King Yudhi§thira, being thus assured by the indication of Lord 
Kr§�a, ordered his youngest brother, Sahadeva, accompanied by soldiers 
of the Srnjaya tribe, to conquer the southern countries. Similarly, he 
128 
Kr�tJ.a, the Supreme Personality of Godhead 
ordered Nakula, accompanied by the soldiers of Matsyadesa, to conquer 
the kings of the western side. He sent Arjuna, accompanied by the soldiers 
of Kekayadesa, to conquer the kings of the northern side, and Bhimasena, 
accompanied by the soldiers of Madradesa (Madras), was ordered to con­
quer the kings on the eastern side. 
It may be noted that by dispatching his younger brothers to conquer in 
different directions, King Yudhi�!hira did not actually intend that they 
declare war with the kings. Actually, the brothers started for different 
directions to inform the respective kings about King Yudhi�!hira's inten­
tion to perform the Rajasiiya sacrifice. The kings were thus informed that 
they were required to pay taxes for the execution of the sacrifice. This 
payment of taxes to Emperor YudhiHhira meant that the king accepted 
his subjugation before him. In case of a king's refusal to act accordingly, 
there was certainly a fight. Thus by their influence and strength, the 
brothers conquered all the kings in different directions, and they were 
able to bring in sufficient taxes and presentations. These were brought 
before King Yudhi�!hira by his brothers. 
King Yudhi�!hira was very anxious, however, when he heard that King 
Jarasandha of Magadha did not accept his sovereignty. Seeing King 
Yudhi�!hira's anxiety, Lord Kr��a informed him of the plan explained by 
Uddhava for conquering King Jarasandha. Bhimasena, Arjuna and Lord 
Kr��a then started together for Girivraja, the capital city of Jarasandha, 
dressing themselves in the garb of briihmarws. This was the plan devised 
by Uddhava before Lord Krwa started for Hastinapura, and now it was 
given practical application. 
King Jarasandha was a very dutiful householder, and he had great 
respect for the briihmarws. He was a great fighter, a k§atriya king, but he 
was never neglectful of the Vedic injunctions. According to Vedic in­
junctions, the briihmarws are considered to be the spiritual masters of all 
other castes. Lord Kr�tJ.a, Arjuna and Bhimasena were actually k§atriyas, 
but they dressed themselves as briihmarws, and at the time when King 
Jarasandha was to give charity to the briihmarws and receive them as 
guests, they approached him. 
Lord Kr��a, in the dress of a briihmm;w, said to the King: "We wish all 
glories to your majesty. We are three guests at your royal palace, and we 
are coming from a great distance. We have come to ask you for charity, and 
we hope that you will kindly bestow upon us whatever we ask from you. 
We know about your good qualities. A person who is tolerant is always pre­
pared to tolerate everything, even though distressful. Just as a criminal can 
perform the most abominable acts, so a greatly charitable person like you 
Liberation of King Jarasandha 
129 
can give anything and everything he is asked for. For a great personality 
like you, there is no distinction between relatives and outsiders. A famous 
man lives forever, even after his death; therefore, any person who is com­
pletely fit and able to execute acts which will perpetuate his good name 
and fame and yet does not do so becomes abominable in the eyes of great 
persons. Such a person cannot be condemned enough, and his refusal to 
give charity is lamentable throughout his whole life. Your majesty must 
have heard the glorious names of charitable personalities such as Hariscan­
dra, Rantideva and Mudgala, who used to live only on grains picked up 
from the paddy field, and the great Maharaja Sibi, who saved the life of a 
pigeon by supplying flesh from his own body. These great personalities 
have attained immortal fame simply by sacrificing this temporary and im­
perishable body." Lord Kr�!la, in the garb of a briihmara, thus informed 
Jarasandha that fame is imperishable, but the body is perishable. If one 
can attain imperishable name and fame by sacrificing his perishable body, 
he becomes a very respectable figure in the history of human civilization. 
While Lord Kr�!la was speaking in the garb of a briihmara along with 
Arjuna and Bhima, J arasandha marked that the three of them did not 
appear to be actual briihmaras. There were signs on their bodies by which 
Jadisandha could understand that they were k�atriyas. Their shoulders 
were marked with an impression due to carrying bows; they had beautiful 
bodily structure, and their voices were grave and commanding. Thus he 
definitely concluded that they were not briihmaras, but k�atriyas. He was 
also thinking that he had seen them somewhere before. Although these 
three persons were k§atriyas, they had come to his door begging alms like 
briihmaras. Therefore he decided that he would fulfill their desires, in 
spite of their being k§atriyas. He thought in this way because their position 
had already been diminished by their appearing before him as beggars. 
"Under the circumstances," he thought, "I am prepared to give them any­
thing. Even if they ask for my body, I shall not hesitate to offer it to 
them." In this regard, he began to think of Bali Maharaja. Lord Vi�!lu in 
the dress of a briihmara appeared as a beggar before Bali, and in that way 
He snatched away all of his opulence and kingdom. He did this for the 
benefit of Indra, who, having been defeated by Bali Maharaja, was bereft 
of his kingdom. Although Bali Maharaja was cheated, his reputation as a 
great devotee who was able to give anything and everything in charity is 
still glorified throughout the three worlds. Bali Maharaja could guess that 
the briihmara was Lord Vi�!lu Himself and that He had come to him just 
to take away his opulent kingdom on behalf of Indra. Bali's spiritual 
master and family priest, Sukracarya, repeatedly warned him about this, 
130 
Kr��a, the Supreme Personality of Godhead 
and yet Bali did not hesitate to give in charity whatever the briihmara 
wanted, and at last he gave up everything to that briihmara. "It is my 
strong determination," thought J arasandha, "that if I can achieve immortal 
reputation by sacrificing this perishable body, I must act for that purpose; 
the life of a k§atriya who does not live for the benefit of the briihmara is 
certainly condemned." 
Actually King J arasandha was very liberal in giving charity to the briih
­
maras, and thus he informed Lord Kr��a, Bhima and Arjuna: "My dear 
briihmaras, you can ask' from me whatever you like. If you so desire, you 
can take my head also. I am prepared to give it." 
After this, Lord Kr��a addressed Jarasandha as follows: "My dear King, 
please note that we are not actually briihmaras, nor have we come to ask 
for foodstuffs or grains. We are all k§atriyas, and we have come to beg a 
duel with you. We hope that you will agree to this proposal. You may note 
that here is the second son of King Pa�9u, Bhimasena, and the third son 
of Pa�9u, Arjuna. As for Myself, you may know that I am your old enemy, 
Krsna, the cousin of the Panda vas." 
. 
. 
. 
. 
. 
When Lord Kr��a disclosed their disguise, King J arasandha began to 
laugh very loudly, and then in great anger and in a grave voice he exclaimed, 
"You fools! If you want to fight with me, I immediately grant your re­
quest. But, Kr��a, I know that You are a coward. I refuse to fight with 
You because You become very confused when You face me in fighting. 
Out of fear of me You left Your own city, Mathura, and now You have 
taken shelter within the sea; therefore I must refuse to fight with You. 
As far as Arjuna is concerned, I know that he is younger than me and is 
not an equal fighter. I refuse to fight with him because he is not in any 
way an equal competitor. But as far as Bhimasena is concerned, I think he 
is a suitable competitor to fight with me." After speaking in this way, 
King J arasandha immediately handed a very heavy club to Bhimasena, 
and he himself took another, and thus all of them went outside the city 
walls to fight. 
Bhimasena and King J arasandha engaged themselves in fighting, and 
with their respective clubs, which were as strong as thunderbolts, they 
began to strike one another very severely, both of them being eager to 
fight. They were both expert fighters with clubs, and their techniques of 
striking one another were so beautiful that they appeared to be two 
dramatic artists dancing on a stage. When the clubs of J arasandha and 
Bhimasena loudly collided, they sounded like the impact of the big tusks 
of two fighting elephants or like a thunderbolt in a flashing electrical 
storm. When two elephants fight together in a sugarcane field, each of them 
Liberation of King J arasandha 
131 
snatches a stick of sugarcane and, by catching it tightly in its trunk, strikes 
the other. Each elephant heavily strikes his enemy's shoulders, arms, collar­
bones, chest, thighs, waist, and legs, and in this way the sticks of sugar­
cane are smashed. Similarly, all the clubs used by J arasandha and Bhimasena 
were broken, and so the two enemies prepared to fight with their strong­
fisted hands. Both J arasandha and Bhimasena were very angry, and they 
began to smash each other with their fists. The striking of their fists 
sounded like the striking of iron bars or like the sound of thunderbolts, 
and they appeared to be like two elephants fighting. Unfortunately, how­
ever, neither was able to defeat the other because both were very expert in 
fighting, both were of equal strength, and their fighting techniques were 
equal also. Neither J arasandha nor Bhimasena became fatigued or defeated 
in the fighting, although they struck each other continually. At the end of 
a day's fighting, both lived at night as friends in Jarasandha's palace, and 
the next day they fought again. In this way they passed twenty-seven days 
in fighting. 
On the twenty-eighth day, Bhimasena told Kr§!la, "My dear Kr§!la, I 
must frankly admit that I cannot conquer Jarasandha." Lord Kr�!la, how­
ever, knew the mystery of the birth of J arasandha. J arasandha was born 
in two different parts from two different mothers. When his father saw 
that the baby was useless, he threw the two parts in the forest, where 
they were later found by a black-hearted witch named Jara. She managed 
to join the two parts of the baby from top to bottom. Knowing this, 
Lord Kf§!la therefore also knew how to kill him. He gave hints to Bhima­
sena that since J arasandha was brought to life by the joining of the two 
parts of his body, he could be killed by the separation of these two parts. 
Thus Lord Kf§!la transferred His power into the body of Bhimasena and 
informed him of the device by which J arasandha could be killed. Lord 
Kr§!la immediately picked up a twig from a tree and, taking it in His hand, 
bifurcated it. In this way He hinted to Bhimasena how J arasandha could 
be killed. Lord Krwa, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, is omnipotent, 
<�.nd if He wants to kill someone, no one can save that person. Similarly, if 
He wants to save someone, no one can kill him. 
Informed by the hints of Lord Kf§!la, Bhimasena immediately took hold 
of the legs of J arasandha and threw him to the ground. When J arasandha 
fell to the ground, Bhimasena immediately pressed one of Jarasandha's 
legs to the ground and took hold of the other leg with his two hands. 
Catching J arasandha in this way, he tore his body in two, beginning from 
the anus up to the head. As an elephant breaks the branches of a tree in 
two,. so Bhimasena separated the body of J arasandha. The audience 
132 
Kf��a, the Supreme Personality of Godhead 
standing nearby saw that the body of J arasandha was now divided into 
two halves, so that each half had one leg, one thigh, one testicle, one 
breast, half a backbone, half a chest, one collarbone, one arm, one eye, 
one ear, and half a face. 
As soon as the news of J arasandha 's death was announced, all the 
citizens of Magadha began to cry, "Alas, alas," while Lord Kr§tta and 
Arjuna embraced Bhimasena to congratulate him. Although J arasandha 
was killed, neither Kr§�a nor the two Pa�9ava brothers made a claim to 
the throne. Their purpose in killing J arasandha was to stop him from 
creating a disturbance against the proper discharge of world peace. A 
demon always creates disturbances, whereas a demigod always tries to 
keep peace in the world. The mission of Lord Kr§tta is to give protection 
to the righteous persons and to kill the demons who disturb a peaceful 
situation. Therefore Lord Kr§tta immediately called for the son of J ara­
sandha, whose name was Sahadeva, and with due ritualistic ceremonies 
He asked him to occupy the seat of his father and reign over the kingdom 
peacefully. Lord Kf§tta is the master of the whole cosmic creation, and 
He wants everyone to live peacefully and execute Kr�tta consciousness. 
After installing Sahadeva on the throne, He released all the kings and 
princes who had been imprisoned unnecessarily by J arasandha. 
Thus ends the Bhaktivedanta purport of the Second Volume, Seven­
teenth Chapter, of Kr§tta, "Liberation of King ]ariisandha." 
18 I Lord Krsna Returns 
•

to the City of Hastinapura 
The kings and the princes released by Lord Kr�J.la after the death of 
Jarasandha were rulers of different parts of the world. Jarasandha was so 
powerful in military strength that he had conquered all these princes and 
kings, numbering 20,800. They were all incarcerated within a mountain 
cave especially constructed as a fort, and for a long time they were kept 
in that situation. When they were released by the grace of Lord Kr��a, 
they all looked very unhappy, their garments were niggardly, and their 
faces were almost dried up for want of proper bodily care. They were 
very weak due to hunger, and their faces had lost all beauty and luster. 
Because of the kings' long imprisonment, every part of their bodies had 
become slackened and invalid. But although suffering in that miserable 
condition of life, they had the opportunity to think about the Supreme 
Personality of Godhead, Vi��u. 
Now before them they saw the color of the transcendental body of 
Lord Kr��a, exactly like the hue of a newly arrived cloud in the sky. He 
appeared before them nicely covered by yellow colored silken garments, 
with four hands like Vi��u, and carrying the different symbols of the club, 
the conchshell, the disc and the lotus flower. There were marks of golden 
lines on His chest, and the nipples of His breast appeared to be like the 
whorl of a lotus flower. His eyes appeared to be spread like the petals of a 
lotus flower, and His smiling face exhibited the symbol of eternal peace 
and prosperity. His glittering earrings were set beautifully, and His helmet 
was bedecked with valuable jewels. The Lord's necklace of pearls and the 
bangles and bracelets nicely situated on His body all shone with a 
transcendental beauty. The Kaustubha jewel hanging on His chest glittered 
with great luster, and the Lord wore a beautiful flower garland. After so 
much distress, when the kings and princes saw Lord Kr��a, with His 
beautiful transcendental features, they looked upon Him to their hearts' 
133 
134 
Kr�!la, the Supreme Personality of Godhead 
content, as if they were drinking nectar through their eyes, licking His 
body with their tongues, smelling the aroma of His body with their noses, 
and embracing Him with their arms. Just by dint of their being in front of 
the Supreme Personality of Godhead, all reactions to their sinful activities 
were washed away. Therefore, without reservation, they surrendered 
themselves at the lotus feet of the Lord. It is stated in the Bhagavad-gitii 
that unless one is freed from all kinds of sinful reactions, one cannot fully 
surrender unto the lotus feet of the Lord. All the princes who saw Lord 
Kr�v-a forgot all their past tribulations. With folded hands and with great 
devotion, they began to offer prayers to Lord Kr�v.a, as follows. 
"Dear Lord, 0 Supreme Personality of Godhead, master of all demi­
gods, You can immediately remove all Your devotees' pangs because Your 
devotees are fully surrendered unto You. 0 dear Lord Kr�v.a, 0 eternal 
Deity of transcendental bliss and knowledge, You are imperishable, and 
we offer our respectful obeisances unto Your lotus feet. It is by Your 
causeless mercy that we have been released from the imprisonment of 
J arasandha, but now we pray unto You to release us from the imprison­
ment with the illusory energy of this material existence. Please, therefore, 
stop our continuous cycle of birth and death. We now have sufficient 
experience of the miserable material condition of life in which we are 
fully absorbed, and having tasted its bitterness, we have come to take 
shelter under Your lotus feet. Dear Lord, 0 killer of the demon Madhu, 
we can now clearly see that Jarasandha was not at fault in the least; it is 
actually by Your causeless mercy that we were bereft of our kingdoms­
because we were very proud of calling ourselves rulers and kings. Any 
ruler or king who becomes too puffed up with false prestige and power 
does not get the opportunity to understand his real constitutional position 
and eternal life. Such foolish so-called rulers and kings become falsely 
proud of their position under the influence of Your illusory energy; they 
are just like a foolish person who considers a mirage in the desert to be a 
reservoir of water. Foolish persons think that their material possessions 
will give them protection, and those who are engaged in sense gratification 
falsely accept this material world as a place of eternal enjoyment. 0 Lord, 
0 Supreme Personality of Godhead, we must admit that, before this, we 
were puffed up with our materiaJ opulences. Because we were all envious 
of each other and wanted to conquer one another, we all engaged in 
fighting for supremacy, even at the cost of sacrificing the lives of many 
citizens." 
This is the disease of political power. As soon as a king or a nation be­
comes rich in material opulences, it wants to dominate other nations by 
Lord Kr��a Returns to the City of Hastinapura 
135 
military aggression. Similarly, mercantile men want to monopolize a 
certain type of business and control other mercantile groups. Degraded by 
false prestige and infatuated by material opulences, human society, instead 
of striving for Kfwa consciousness, creates havoc and disrupts peaceful 
living. Thus men naturally forget the real purpose of life: to attain the 
favor of Lord Vi��u, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. 
The kings continued: "0 Lord, we were simply engaged in the abomin­
able task of killing citizens and alluring them to be �nnecessarily killed, 
just to satisfy our political whims. We did not consider that Your Lordship 
is always present before us in the form of cruel death. We were so fooled 
that we became the cause of death for others, forgetting our own im­
pending death. But, dear Lord, the retaliation of the time element, which 
is Your representative, is certainly insurmountable. The time element is so 
strong that no one can escape its influence; therefore we have received the 
reactions of our atrocious activities, and we are now bereft of all opulences 
and stand before You like street beggars. We consider our position to be 
Your causeless, unalloyed mercy upon us because now we can understand 
that we were falsely proud and that our material opulences could be with­
drawn from us within a second by Your will. By Your causeless mercy 
only, we are now able to think of Your J otus feet. This is our greatest gain. 
Dear Lord, it is known to everyone that the body is a breeding ground of 
diseases. Now we are sufficiently aged, and instead of being proud of our 
bodily strength, we are getting weaker day by day. We are no longer 
interested in sense gratification or the false happiness derived through the 
material body. By Your grace, we have now come to the conclusion that 
hankering after such material happiness is just like searching for water in a 
desert mirage. We are no longer interested in the results of our pious activi­
ties, such as performing great sacrifices in order· to be elevated to the 
heavenly planets. We now understand that such elevation to a higher 
material standard of life in the heavenly planets may sound very relishable, 
but actually there cannot be any happiness within this material world. We 
pray for Your Lordship to favor us by instructing us how to engage in the 
transcendental loving service of Your lotus feet so that we may never 
forget our eternal relationship withY our Lordship. We do not want libera­
tion from the entanglement of material existence. By Your will we may 
take birth in any species of life; it does not matter. We simply pray that 
we may never forget Your lotus feet under any circumstances. Dear Lord, 
we now surrender unto Your lotus feet by offering our respectful 
obeisances unto You because You are the Supreme Lord, the Per­
sonality of Godhead, Kr�!la, the son of Vasudeva. You are the Super-
LJ 
136 
���a, the Supreme Personality of Godhead 
soul in everyone's heart, and You are Lord Hari, who can take away 
all miserable conditions of material existence. Dear Lord, Your name is 
Govinda, the reservoir of all pleasure. One who is engaged in satisfying 
Your senses automatically satisfies his own senses also, and therefore You 
are known as Govinda. Dear Lord, You are ever famous, for You can put 
an end to all the miseries of Your devotees. Please, therefore, accept us as 
Your surrendered servants." 
After hearing the prayers of the kings released from the prison of 
J arasandha, Lord Kr��a, who is always the protector of surrendered souls 
and the ocean of mercy for the devotees, replied to them as follows in His 
sweetly transcendental voice, which was grave and full of meaning. "My 
dear kings," He said, "I bestow upon you My blessings. From this day 
forth you will be attached to My devotional service without fail. I give you 
this benediction, as you have desired. You may know from Me that I am 
'always sitting within your hearts as Supersoul, and because you have now 
turned your faces towards Me, I, as master of everyone, shall always give 
you good counsel so that you may never forget Me and so that gradually 
you will come back home, back to Godhead. My dear kings, your deci­
sion to give up all conceptions of material enjoyment and turn instead 
toward My devotional service is factually the symptom of your good 
fortune. Henceforward you will always be blessed with blissful life. I 
confirm that all you have spoken about Me in your prayers is factual. It is 
a fact that the materially opulent position of one who is not fully Kr�p.a 
conscious is the cause of his downfall and of his becoming a victim of the 
illusory energy. In the past, there were many rebellious kings, such as 
Haihaya, Nahu�a, Vena, Rava�a and Narakasura. Some of them were 
demigods, and some of them were demons, but because of their false 
perception of their positions, they fell from their exalted posts, and thus 
they no longer remained the kings of their respective kingdoms. 
"While lost in the violence of conditional life, every one of you must 
understand that anything material has its starting point, growth, expansion, 
deterioration, and, finally, disappearanc�. All material bodies are subjected 
to these six conditions, and any relative acquisitions which are accumulated 
by this body are definitely subject to final destruction. Therefore, no one 
should be attached to perishable things. As long as one is within this 
material body, he should be very cautious in worldly dealings. The most 
perfect way of life in this material world is simply to be devoted to My 
transcendental loving service and to honestly execute the prescribed duties 
of one's particular position of life. As far as you are concerned, you all 
belong to k§atriya families. Therefore, you should live honestly, according 
Lord K���a Returns to the City of Hastinapura 
137 
to the prescribed duties befitting the royal order, and you should make 
your citizens happy in all respects. Keep to the standard of k§atriya life. 
Do not beget children out of sense gratification, but simply take charge of 
the welfare of the people in general. Everyone takes birth in this material 
world because of the contaminated desires of his previous life, and thus he 
is subjected to the stringent laws of nature, such as birth and death, 
distress and happiness, profit and loss. One should not be disturbed by 
duality, but should always be fixed in My service and thus remain balanced 
in mind and satisfied in all circumstances, considering all things to be 
given by Me, and one should remain undeviated from engagement in 
devotional service. Thus one can live a very happy and peaceful life, even 
within this material condition. In other words, one should actually be 
callous to this material body and its by-products and should remain 
unaffected by them. He should remain fully satisfied in the interests of the 
spirit soul and be engaged in the service of the Supersoul. One should 
engage his mind only on Me, one should simply become My devotee, one 
should simply worship Me, and one should offer his respectful obeisances 
unto Me alone. In this way, one can cross over this ocean of nescience very 
easily and at the end come back to Me. In conclusion, your lives should 
constantly be engaged in My service." 
After delivering His instructions to the kings and princes, Lord Krwa 
immediately arranged for their comfort and asked many servants and 
maidservants to take care of them. Lord K���a requested Sahadeva, the 
son of King Jarasandha, to supply all necessities to the kings and also 
asked him to show them all respect and honor. In pursuance of the order 
of Lord Kt��a, Sahadeva offered them all honor, and presented them with 
ornaments, garments, garlands, and other paraphernalia. After taking 
their baths and dressing very nicely, the kings appeared happy and gentle. 
Then they were supplied nice foodstuffs. Lord Kt��a supplied everything 
for their comfort, as was befitting their royal positions. Since the kings 
were so mercifully treated by Lord K���a, they felt great happiness, and 
all their bright faces appeared just like the stars in the sky after the end 
of the rainy season. They were all nicely dressed and ornamented, and 
their earrings glittered. Each one was then seated on a chariot bedecked 
with gold and jewels and drawn by decorated horses. After seeing that 
each was taken care of, Lord Kt��a, in a sweet voice, asked them to return 
to their respective kingdoms. By His very liberal behavior, unparalleled in 
the history of the world, Lord Kt��a released all the kings who had been 
in the clutches of J arasandha, and being fully satisfied, the kings began to 
engage in chanting His holy name, thinking of His holy form, and glorify-
138 
Kr�J)a, the Supreme Personality of Godhead 
ing His transcendental pastimes as the Supreme Personality of Godhead. 
So engaged, they returned to their respective kingdoms. The citizens of 
their kingdoms were very greatly pleased to see them return, and when 
they heard of the kind dealings of Lord Kr�tta, they all became very 
happy. The kings began to manage the affairs of their kingdoms in accord­
ance with the instructions of Lord Kr�tta, and all those kings and their 
subjects passed their days very happily. This is the vivid example of the 
Kr§tta conscious society. If the people of the world divide the whole 
society, in terms of their respective material qualities, into four orders for 
material and spiritual progress, centering around K�§tta and following the 
instructions of K�§tta as stated in Bhagavad-gitii, the entire human society 
will undoubtedly be happy. This is the lesson that we have to take from 
this incident. 
After thus causing the annihilation of J arasandha by Bhimasena and 
after being properly honored by Sahadeva, the son of Jarasandha, Lord 
Kf§tta, accompanied by Bhimasena and Arjuna, returned to the city of 
Hastinapura. When they reached the precincts of Hastinapura, they blew 
their respective conchshells, and by hearing the sound vibrations and 
understanding who was arriving, everyone immediately became cheerful. 
But upon hearing the conchshells, the enemies of Kr§tta became very sorry. 
The citizens of lndraprastha felt their hearts become joyful simply by 
hearing the vibration of Kr§tta's conchshell because they could understand 
that J arasandha had been killed. Now the performance of the Rajasiiya 
sacrifice by King Yudhi§!hira was almost certain. Bhimasena, Arjuna, and 
Kf§tta, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, arrived before King Yudhi­
§!hira and offered their respeCts to the King. King Yudhi§!hira attentively
heard the narration of the killing of J arasandha and the setting free of the 
kings. He also heard of the tactics which were adopted by Kr§tta to kill 
J arasandha. The king was naturally affectionate toward Kr§tta, but after 
hearing the story, he became even more bound in love for Krwa; tears of 
ecstasy glided from his eyes, and he became so stunned that he was almost 
unable to speak. 
Thus ends the Bhaktivedanta purport of the Second Volume, Eighteenth
Chapter, of Kf§tta, "Lord Kr§"!la Returns to the City of Hastiniipura."
19 I The Deliverance of Sisupala 
King Yudhi§thira became very happy after hearing the details of the 
Jarasandha episode, and he spoke as follows: "My dear Kr§v.a, 0 eternal 
form of bliss and knowledge, all the exalted directors of the affairs of this 
material world, including Lord Brahma, Lord Siva and King Indra, are 
always anxious to receive and carry out orders from You, and whenever 
they are fortunate enough to receive such orders, they immediately take 
them and keep them in their hearts. 0 Kr§v.a, You are unlimited, and 
although we sometimes think of ourselves as royal kings and rulers of the 
world and become puffed up over our paltry positions, we are very poor 
in heart. Actually, we are fit to be punished by You, but the wonder is 
that instead of punishing us, You so kindly and mercifully accept our 
orders and carry them out properly. Others are very surprised that Your 
Lordship can play the part of an ordinary human, but we can understand 
that You are performing these activities just like a dramatic artist. Your 
real position is always exalted, exactly like that of the sun, which always 
remains at the same temperature both during the time of its rising and the 
time of its setting. Although we feel the difference in temperature between 
the rising and the setting sun, the temperature of the sun never changes. 
You are always transcendentally equiposed, and thus You are neither 
pleased nor disturbed by any condition of material affairs. You are the 
Supreme Brahman, the Personality of Godhead, and for You there are no 
relativities. My dear Madhava, You are never defeated by anyone. Material 
distinctions-'This is me.' 'This is you.' 'This is mine.' 'This is yours.' -are 
all conspicious by dint of their absence in You. Such distinctions are 
visible in the lives of everyone, even the animals, but those who are pure 
devotees are freed from these false distinctions. Since these distinctions 
are absent in Your devotees, they cannot possibly be present in You." 
Mter satisfying Kr§v.a in this way, King Yudhi§thira arranged to perform 
139 
140 
Kr��a, the Supreme Personality of Godhead 
the Rajasiiya sacrifice. He invited all the qualified briihmar-as and sages to 
take part and appointed them to different positions as priests in charge 
of the sacrificial arena. He invited the most expert briihmar-as and sages; 
whose names are as follows: Kr�tta-dvaipayana Vyasadeva, Bharadvaja, 
Sumantu, Gautama, Asita, V asi�tha, Cyavana, Kattva, Maitreya, Kava�a, 
Trita, Visvamitra, Vamadeva, Sumati, .Jaimini, Kratu, Paila, Parasara, Garga, 
Vaisampayana, 
Atharva, 
Kasyapa, Dhaumya, Parasurama, Sukracarya, 
Asuri, Vitihotra, Madhucchanda, Virasena, and Akrtavratta. Besides all these 
briihmar-as and sages, he invited such respectful old men as Drottacarya, 
Bhi�ma, the grandfather of the Kurus, Krpacarya, and Dhrtara�tra. He 
also invited all the sons of Dhrtara�tra, headed by Duryodhana, and the 
great devotee Vidura was also invited. Kings from different parts of the 
world, along with their ministers and secretaries, were also invited to see 
the great sacrifice performed by King Yudhi�thira, and the citizens, 
comprising learned briihmar-as, chivalrous k§atriyas, well-to-do vaisyas, and 
faithful sudras, all visited the ceremony. 
The briihmar-a priests and sages in charge of the �acrificial ceremony 
constructed the sacrificial arena as usual with a plow of gold, and they 
initiated King Yudhi�thira as the performer of the great sacrifice, in ac­
cordance with Vedic rituals. Long years ago, when V arutta performed a 
similar sacrifice, all the sacrificial utensils were made of gold. Similarly, 
in the Rajasiiya sacrifice of King Yudhi�thira, all the utensils required for 
the sacrifice were golden. 
In order to participate in the great sacrifice performed by King 
Yudhi�thira, all the exalted demigods like Lord Brahma, Lord Siva, and 
Indra the King of heaven, accompanied by their associates, as well as the 
predominating deities of higher planetary systems like Gandharvaloka, 
Siddhaloka, Janaloka, Tapoloka, Nagaloka, Yak�aloka, Rak�asaloka, Pak�i­
loka and Carattaloka, as well as famous kings and their queens, were all 
present by the invitation of King Yudhi�thira. All the respectable sages, 
kings and demigods who assembled there unanimously agreed that King 
YudhiHhira was quite competent to take the responsibility of performing 
the Rajasiiya sacrifice; no one was in disagreement on this fact. All of them 
knew thoroughly the position of King Yudhi�thira; because he was a great 
devotee of Lord Kr�tJ-a, no accomplishment was extraordinary for him. 
The learned briihmar-as and priests saw to it that the sacrifice by Maharaja 
Yudhi�thira was performed in exactly the same way as in bygone ages by 
the demigod Varutta. According to the Vedic system, whenever there is an 
arrangement for sacrifice, the members participating in the sacrifice are 
offered the juice of the soma plant. The juice of the soma plant is a kind 
The Deliverance of Sisupala 
141 
of life-giving beverage. On the day of extracting the soma juice, King 
Yudhi�thira very respectfully received the special priest who had been 
engaged to detect any mistake in the formalities of sacrificial procedures. 
The idea is that the Vedic mantras must be enuciated perfectly and chanted 
with the proper accent; if the priests who are engaged in this business 
commit any mistake, the checker or referee priest immediately corrects 
the procedure, and thus the ritualistic performances are perfectly executed. 
Unless it is perfectly executed, a sacrifice cannot yield the desired result. 
In this age of Kali there is no such learned briihmarw or priest available; 
therefore, all such sacrifices are forbidden. The only sacrifice recommended 
in the siistras is the chanting of the Hare Kr�!la mantra. 
Another important procedure is that the most exalted personality in 
the assembly of such a sacrificial ceremony is first offered worship. After 
all arrangements were made for Yudhi�thira's sacrifice, the next considera­
tion was who should be worshiped first in the ceremony. This particular 
ceremony is called Agrapilja. Agra means first, and pfijii means worship. 
This Agrapilja is similar to election of the president. In the sacrificial 
assembly, all the members were very exalted. Some proposed to elect one 
person as the perfect candidate for accepting Agrapilja, and others pro­
posed someone else. 
When the matter remained undecided, Sahadeva began to speak in 
favor of Lord Kr�!la. He said, "Lord Kr�!la, the best amongst the members 
of the Y adu dynasty and the protector of His devotees, is the most exalted 
personality in this assembly. Therefore I think that He should without any 
objection be offered the honor of being worshiped first. Although demi­
gods such as Lord Brahma, Lord Siva, lndra, the King of heavenly planets, 
and many other exalted personalities are present in this assembly, no one 
can be equal to or greater than Krwa in terms of time, space, riches, 
strength, reputation, wisdom, renunciation or any other consideration. 
Anything which is considered opulent is present originally in Kr§!la. As an 
individual soul is the basic principle of the growth of his material body, 
similarly Kr�!la is the Supersoul of this cosmic manifestation. All kinds of 
Vedic ritualistic ceremonies, such as the performance of sacrifices, the 
offering of oblations in the fire, the chanting of the Vedic hymns and the 
practice of mystic yoga-all are meant for realizing Kr�!la. Whether one 
follows the path of fruitive activities or the path of philosophical specu­
lation, the ultimate destination is Kr�!la; all bona fide methods of self­
realization are meant for understanding Kr�!la. Ladies and gentlemen, it is 
superfluous to speak about Kr§!la, because every one of you exalted per­
sonalities know the Supreme Brahman, Lord Kr�!la, for whom there are no 
I 
I 
I 
142 
Kr��a, the Supreme Personality of Godhead 
material differences between body and soul, between energy and the 
energetic, or between one part of the body and another. Since everyone is 
a part and parcel of Kr��a, there is no qualitative difference between 
Kr�!la and all living entities. Everything is an emanation of Kr�!la's energies, 
the material and spiritual energies. Kr��a's energies are like the heat and 
light of the fire; there is no difference between the quality of heat and 
light and the fire itself. 
"Also, Kr�!la can do anything He likes with any part of His body. We 
can execute a particular action with the help of a particular part of our 
body, but He can do anything and everything with any part of His body. 
And because His transcendental body is full of knowledge and bliss in 
eternity, He doesn't undergo the six kinds of material changes-birth, 
existence, growth, fruitive action, dwindling and vanishing. Unforced by 
any external energy, He is the supreme cause of the creation, maintenance 
and dissolution of everything that be. By the grace of Kr�!la only, everyone 
is engaged in the practice of religiousness, the development of economic 
conditions, the satisfaction of the senses and, ultimately, the achievement 
of liberation from material bondage. These four principles of progressive 
life can be executed by the mercy of Kr��a only. He should therefore be 
offered the first worship of this great sacrifice, and no one should disagree. 
As by watering the root, the watering of the branches, twigs, leaves and 
flowers is automatically accomplished, or as by supplying food to the 
stomach, the nutrition and metabolism of all parts of the body are auto­
matically established, so by offering the first worship to Kr��a, everyone 
present in this meeting-including the great demigods-will be satisfied. If 
anyone is charitably disposed, it will be very good for him to give in charity 
only to Kr��a, who is the Supersoul of everyone, regardless of his particular 
body or individual personality. Kr�!la is present as the Supersoul in every 
living being, and if we can satisfy Him, then automatically every living 
being becomes satisfied." 
Sahadeva was fortunate to know of the glories of Kr��a, and after 
describing them in brief, he stopped speaking. After this speech was de­
livered, all the members present in that great sacrificial assembly applauded, 
confirming his words continuously by saying, "Everything that you have 
said is completely perfect. Everything that you have said is completely 
perfect." King YudhiHhira, after hearing the confirmation of all present, 
especially of the briihmar-as and learned sages, worshiped Lord Kr��a 
according to the regulative principles of the Vedic injunctions. First of all, 
King Yudhi�thira-along with his brothers, wives, children, other relatives 
and ministers-washed the lotus feet of Lord Kr��a and sprinkled the water 
on their heads. After this, Lord Kr��a was offered various kinds of silken 
The Deliverance of Sisupala 
143 
garments of yellow color, and heaps of jewelry and ornaments were 
presented before Him for His use. 
King Yudhi�thira felt such ecstasy by honoring Kr§�a, who was his only 
lovable object, that tears glided down from his eyes, and although He 
wanted to, he could not see Lord Kr§�a very well. Lord Kr§�a was thus 
worshiped by King Yudhi§thira. At that time all the members present in 
that assembly stood up with folded hands and began to chant, "Jaya! 
]aya! Nama�! Nama�!" When all joined together to offer their respectful 
obeisances to Kr§�a, there were showers of flowers from the sky. 
In that meeting, King Sisupala was also present. He was an avowed 
enemy of Kf§�a for many reasons, especially because of Kr§�a's having 
stolen Rukmi�i from the marriage ceremony; therefore, he could not 
tolerate such honor to Kr§�a and glorification of His qualities. Instead of 
being happy to hear the glories of the Lord, he became very angry. When 
everyone offered respect to Kr§�a by standing up, Sisupala remained in his 
seat, but when he became angry at Kr§�a's being honored, Sisupala stood 
up suddenly, and, raising his hand, began to speak very strongly and fear­
lessly against Lord Krwa. He spoke in such a way that Lord Kr�!la could 
hear him very distinctly. 
"Ladies and gentlemen, I can appreciate now the state�ent of the Vedas 
that, after all, time is the predominating factor. In spite of all endeavors to 
the contrary, the time element executes its own plan without opposition. 
For example, one _may try his best to live, but when the time for death 
comes, no one can check it. I see here that although there are many 
stalwart personalities present in this assembly, the influence of time is so 
strong that they have been misled by the statement of a boy who has 
foolishly spoken about Kr§�a. There are many learned sages and elderly 
persons present, but still they have· accepted the statement of a foolish 
boy. This means that by the influence of time, even the intelligence of such 
honored persons as are present in this meeting can be misdirected. I fully 
agree with the respectable persons present here that they are competent 
enough to select the personality who can be first worshiped, but I cannot 
agree with the statement of a boy like Sahadeva, who has spoken so highly 
about Kr§�a and has recommended that Kr§�a is fit to accept the fjrst 
worship in the sacrifice. I can see that in this meeting there are many 
personalities who have undergone great austerities, who are highly learned 
and who have performed many penances. By their knowledge and dir�ction, 
they can deliver many persons who are suffering from the pangs of material 
existence. There are great [§is here whose knowledge has no bounds, as 
well as many self-realized persons and briihmartas also, and therefore I 
think that any one of them could have been selected for the first worship 
144 
Kr��a, the Supreme Personality of Godhead 
because they are worshipable even by the great demigods, kings and em­
perors. I cannot understand how you could have selected this cowherd 
boy, Kr§�a, and have left aside all these other great personalities. I think 
Krwa to be no better than a crow-how can He be fit to accept the first 
worship in this great sacrifice? 
"We cannot even ascertain as yet to which caste this Kr��a belongs or 
what His actual occupational duty is." Actually, Krwa does not belong to 
any caste, nor does He have to perform any occupational duty. It is stated 
in the Vedas that the Supreme Lord has nothing to do as His prescribed 
duty. Whatever has to be done on His behalf is executed by His different 
energtes. 
Sisupala continued: "Kr§�a does not belong to a high family. He is so 
independent that no one knows His principles of religious life. It appears 
that He is outside the jurisdiction of all religious principles. He always acts 
independently, not caring for the Vedic injunctions and regulative prin­
ciples. Therefore He is devoid of all good qualities." Sisupala indirectly 
praised Kr§�a by saying that He is not within the jurisdiction of Vedic 
injunction. This is true because He is the Supreme Personality of Godhead. 
That He has no qualities means that Kr§�a has no material qualities, and 
because He is the Supreme Personality of Godhead, He acts independently, 
not caring for conventions or social or religious principles. 
Sisupala continued: "Under these circumstances, how can He be fit to 
accept the first worship in the sacrifice? Krwa is so foolish that He has left 
Mathura, which is inhabited by highly elevated persons following the Vedic 
culture, and He has taken shelter in the ocean, where there is not even talk 
of the Vedas. Instead of living openly, He has constructed a fort within the 
water and is living in an atmosphere where there is no discussion of Vedic 
knowledge. And whenever He comes out of the fort, He simply harrasses 
the citizens like a dacoit, thief or rogue." 
Sisupala went crazy because of Kr§�a's being elected the supreme 
first-worshiped person in that meeting, and he spoke so irresponsibly that 
it appeared that he had lost all his good fortune. Being overcast with 
misofrutne, Sisupala continued to insult Kr§�a further, and Lord Kr§�a 
patiently heard him without protest. Just as a lion does not care when a 
flock of jackals howl, Lord Kr§�a remained silent and unprovoked. Kr§�a 
did not reply to even a single accusation made by Sisupala, but all the 
members present in the meeting, except a few who agreed with Sisupala, 
became very agitated because it is the duty of any respectable person not 
to tolerate blasphemy against God or His devotee. Some of them, who 
thought that they could not properly take action against Sisupala, left the 
assembly in protest, covering their ears with their hands in order not to 
The Deliverance of Sisupala 
145 
hear further accusations. Thus they left the meeting condemning the action 
of Sisupala. It is the Vedic injunction that whenever there is blasphemy of 
the Supreme Personality of Godhead, one must immediately leave. If he 
does not do so, he becomes bereft of his pious activities and is degraded to 
the lower condition of life. 
All the kings present, belonging to the Kuru dynasty, Matsya dynasty, 
Kekaya dynasty and S�fijaya dynasty, became very angry and immediately 
took up their swords and shields to kill Sisupala. Sisupala was so foolish 
that he did not become even slightly agitated, although all the kings present 
were ready to kill him. He did not care to think of the pros and cons 
of his foolish talking, and when he saw that all the kings were ready 
to kill him, instead of stopping, he stood to fight with them and took 
up his sword and shield. When Lord Kr�!la saw that they were going 
to engage in fighting In the arena of the auspicious Rajasiiya yajiia, He 
personally pacified them. Out of His causeless mercy He Himself decided 
to kill Sisupala. When Sisupala was abusing the kings who were about to 
attack him, Lord Kr�!la took up His disc, which was as sharp as the blade of 
a razor, and immediately separated the head of Sisupala from his body. 
When Sisupala was thus killed, a great roar and howl went up from the 
crowd of that assembly. Taking advantage of that disturbance, the few 
kings who were supporters of Sisupala quickly left the assembly out of fear 
of their lives. But despite all this, the fortunate Sisupala's spirit soul imme­
diately merged into the body of Lord Kr�!la in the presence of all members, 
exactly as a burning meteor falls to the surface of the globe. Sisupala's soul's 
merging into the transcendental body of Kr�!la reminds us of the story of 
J aya and Vijaya, who fell to the material world from the V aiku!ltha planets 
upon being cursed by the four Kumaras. For their return to the V aiku!ltha 
world, it was arranged that both Jaya and Vijaya for three consecutive 
births would act as deadly enemies of the Lord, and at the end of these 
lives they would again return to the V aiku!ltha world and serve the Lord 
as His associates. 
Although Sisupala acted as the enemy of Kr�!la, he was not for a single 
moment out of Kr�!la consciousness. He was always absorbed in thought 
of Kr�!la, and thus he got first the salvation of siiyujya-muk ti, merging into 
the existence of the Supreme, and finally became reinstated in his original 
position of personal service. The Bhagavad-gitii corroborates the fact that 
if one is absorbed in the thought of the Supreme Lord at the time of death, 
he immediately enters the kingdom of God after quitting his material body. 
After the salvation of Sisupala, King Yudhi�thira rewarded all the members 
present in the sacrificial assembly. He sufficiently remunerated the priests 
and the learned sages for their engagement in the execution of the sacrifice, 
146 
Kr�!J.a, the Supreme Personality of Godhead 
and after performing all this routine work, he took his bath. This bath at 
the end of the sacrifice is also technical. It is called the avabhrtha bath. 
Lord Kr�!la thus enabled the performance of the Rajasiiya yajfia arranged 
by King Yudhi�thira to be successfully completed, and, being requested by 
His cousins and relatives, He remained in Hastinapura for a few months 
more. Although King Yudhi�!hira and his brothers were not willing to have 
Lord Kr�!la leave Hastinapura, Kr��a arranged to take permission from the 
King to return to Dvaraka, and thus He returned home along with His 
queens and ministers. 
The story of the fall of Jaya and Vijaya from the Vaiku!J.tha planets to 
the material world is described in the Seventh Canto of Srimad-Bhiigavatam. 
The killing of Sisupala has a direct link with that narration of J aya and 
Vijaya, but the most important instruction that we get from this incident 
is that the Supreme Personality of Godhead, being absolute, can give salva­
tion to everyone, whether one acts as His enemy or as His friend. It is 
therefore a misconception that the Lord act� with someone in the relation­
ship of a friend and with someone else in the relationship of an eneiny. His 
being an enemy or friend is always on the absolute platform. There is no 
material distinction. 
After King Yudhi�thira took his bath after the sacrifice and stood in the 
midst of all the learned sages and briihmar-as, he seemed exactly like the 
King of heaven and thus looked very beautiful. King YudhiHhira suffi­
ciently rewarded all the demigods who participated in the yajfia, and being 
greatly satisfied, all of them left praising the King's activities and glorifying 
Lord Krsna. 
Whe� 
· Sukadeva Gosvami was narrating these incidents of Kr�!la 's killing 
Sisupala and describing the successful execution of the Rajasiiya yajfia by 
Maharaja Yudhi�thira, he pointed out also that after the successful ter­
mination of the yajfia there was only one person who was not happy. He 
was Duryodhana. Duryodhana by nature was very envious because of his 
sinful life, and he appeared in the dynasty of the Kurus as a chronic disease 
personified in order to destroy the whole family. 
Sukadeva Gosvami assured Maharaja Pan1qit that the pastimes of Lord 
Kr��a-the killing of Sisupala and Jarasandha and the releasing of the 
imprisoned kings-are all transcendental vibrations, and anyone who hears 
these narrations from the authorized persons will be immediately freed 
from all the reactions of the sinful activities of his life. 
Thus ends the Bhaktivedanta purport of the Second Volume, Nineteenth 
Chapter of Kr�!J.a, "The Deliverance of Sisupiila." 
20 I Why Duryodhana Felt Insulted 
at the End of the Rajasiiya Sacrifice 
King Yudhi�thira was known as ajiitasatru, or a person who has no 
enemy. Therefore, when all men, all demigods, all kings, sages and saints 
saw the successful termination of the Rajasuya yajiia performed by King 
Yudhi�thira, they became very happy. That Duryodhana alone was not 
happy was astonishing to Maharaja Parik�it, and therefore he requested 
Sukadeva Gosvami to explain this. 
_ S�kadeva Gosvami said, "My dear King Parik�it, your grandfather, King 
Yudhi�thira, was a great soul. His congenial disposition attracted everyone 
as his friend, and therefore he was known as ajiitasatru, one who never 
created an enemy. He engaged all the_ members of the Kuru dynasty in 
taking charge of diffP-rent departments for the management of the Raja­
suya sacrifice. For example, Bhimasena was put in charge of the kitchen 
department, Duryodhana in charge of the treasury department, Sahadeva 
in charge of the reception department, Nakula in charge of the store 
department, and Arjuna was engaged in looking after the comforts of the 
elderly persons. The most astonishing feature was that Kr�v-a, the Supreme 
Personality of Godhead, took charge of washing the feet of all the incoming 
guests. The Queen, the goddess of fortune Draupadi, was in charge of 
administering the distribution of food, and because Karv-a was famous for 
giving charity, he was put in charge of the charity department. In this way 
Satyaki, Vikaqta, Hardikya, Vidura, Bhurisrava, and Santardana, the son 
of Bahlika, were all engaged in different departments for managing the 
affairs of the Rajasiiya sacrifice. They were all so bound in loving affection 
for King Yudhi�thira that they simply wanted to please him. 
After Sisupala had died by the mercy of Lord Kr�v-a and had become 
merged in the spiritual existence, and after the end of the Rajasiiya yajiia, 
when all friends, guests and well-wishers had been sufficiently honored and 
rewarded, King Yudhi�thira went to bathe in the Ganges. The city of 
147 
148 
Kr��a, the Supreme Personality of Godhead 
Hastinapura is today standing on the bank of the Yamuna, and the state­
ment of Srimad-Bhiigavatam that King Yudhi�thira went to bathe in the 
Ganges indicates, therefore, that during the time of the Pa1)9-avas, the 
River Yam una was also known as the Ganges. While the King was taking 
the avabhrtha bath, different musical instruments, such as mrdangas, conch­
shells, drums, kettledrums and bugles, vibrated. In addition, the ankle bells 
of the dancing girls jingled. Many groups of professional singers played 
viriis, 
flutes, gongs and cymbals, and thus a tumultuous sound vi­
brated in the sky. 
The princely guests from many kingdoms, like 
Srnjaya, Kamboja, Kuru, Kekaya and Kosala, were present with their 
different flags and gorgeously decorated elephants, chariots, horses and 
soldiers. All were passing in a processio1,1, and King Yudhi�thira was in the 
forefront. The executive members, such _as the priests, religious ministers 
and briihmar;ws, were performing a sacrifice, and all were loudly chanting 
the Vedic hymns. The demigods, the inhabitants of the Pitrloka and 
Gandharvaloka, as well as many sages, showered flowers from the sky. 
The men and women of Hastinapura, lndraprastha, their bodies ·smeared 
with scents and floral oils, were nicely dressed in colorful garments and 
decorated with garlands, jewels and ornaments. They were all enjoying the 
ceremony, and they threw on each other liquid substances like water, oil, 
milk, butter and yogurt. Some even smeared these on each other's bodies. 
In this way, they were enjoying the occasion. The professional prostitutes 
were also engaged by jubilantly smearing these liquid substances on the 
bodies of the men, and the men reciprocated in the same way. All the 
liquid substances had been mixed with turmeric and saffron, and their 
color was a lustrous yellow. 
In order to observe the great ceremony, many wives of the demigods 
had come in different airplanes, and they were visible in the sky. Similarly, 
the queens of the royal family arrived gorgeously decorated and surrounded 
by bodyguards on the surface on different palaquins. During this time, 
Lord Krwa, the maternal cousin of the Pa1)9-avas, and His special friend 
Arjuna, were both throwing the liquid substances on the bodies of the 
queens. The queens became bashful, but at the same time their beautiful ) 
smiling brightened their faces. Because of the liquid substances thrown on 
their bodies, the saris covering them became completely wet. The different 
parts of their beautiful bodies, particularly their breasts and their waists, 
became partially visible because of the wet cloth. The queens also brought 
in buckets of liquid substances and sprinkled them on the bodies of their 
brothers-in-law. As they engaged in such jubilant activities, their hair fell 
loose, and the flowers decorating their bodies began to fall. When Lord 
Why Duryodhana Felt Insulted 
149 
Kr�tJ-a, Aijuna and the queens were thus engaged in these jubilant activities, 
persons who were not clean in heart became agitated by lustful desires. In 
other words, such behavior between pure males and females is enjoyable, 
but persons who are materially contaminated become lustful. 
King Yudhi�thira, in a gorgeous chariot yoked by excellent horses, was. 
present with his queens, including Draupadi and others. The festivities of 
the sacrifice were so beautiful that it appeared as if Rajasiiya was standing 
there in person with the functions of the sacrifice. 
Following the Rajasiiya sacrifice, there was the Vedic ritualistic duty 
known as patnisarhyiija. This sacrifice was performed along with one's 
wife, and it was also duly performed by the priests of King Yudhi�thira. 
When Queen Draupadi and King Yudhi�thira were taking their avabhrtha 
bath, the citizens of Hastinapura as well as the demigods began to beat on 
drums and blow trumpets out of feelings of happiness, and there was a 
shower of flowers from the sky. When the King and the Queen finished 
their bath in the Ganges, all the other citizens, consisting of all the varras 
or castes-the briihmaras, the k§atriyas, the vaisyas, and the sudras-took 
their baths in the Ganges. Bathing in the Ganges is recommended in the 
Vedic literatures because by such bathing one becomes freed from all 
sinful reactions. This is still current in India, especially at particularly 
auspicious moments. At such times, millions of people bathe in the Ganges. 
Mter taking his bath, King Yudhi�thira dressed in a new silken cloth 
and wrapper and decorated himself with valuable jewelry. The King not 
only dressed himself and decorated himself, but he also gave clothing and. 
ornaments to all the priests and to the others who had participated in the 
yajiias. In this way, they were all worshiped by King Yudhi�thira. He 
constantly worshiped his friends, his family members, his relatives, his 
well-wishers and everyone present, and because he was a great devotee of 
Lord Narayal).a, or because he was a V ai�tJ-ava, he therefore knew how to 
treat everyone well. The Mayavadi philosophers' endeavor to see everyone 
as God is an artificial way towards oneness, but a V ai§tJ-ava or a devotee of 
Lord NarayatJ-a sees every living entity as part and parcel of the Supreme 
Lord. Therefore, a V ai§tJ-ava 's treatment of other living entities is 011: the 
absolute platform. Since one cannot treat one part of his body differently 
from another part because they all belong to the same body, so a V ai§tJ-ava 
does not see a human being as distinct from an animal because in both of 
them he sees the soul and the Supersoul seated simultaneously. 
When everyone was refreshed after bathing and was dressed in silken 
clothing with jeweled earrings, flower garlands, turbans, long wrappers and 
pearl necklaces, they looked, altogether, like the demigods from heaven. 
150 
Kr��a, the Supreme Personality of Godhead 
This was especially true of the women, who were very nicely dressed. Each 
wore a golden belt around the waist. They were all smiling. Spots of tilaka 
and curling hair were scattered here and there. This combination was very 
attractive. 
Persons who had participated in the Rajasiiya sacrifice-including the 
most cultured priests, the briihmarws who had assisted in the performance 
of the sacrifice, the citizens of all vaqws, kings, demigods, sages, saints and 
citizens of the Pitrloka-were all very much satisfied by the dealings of King 
Yudhi�thira, and at the end they happily departed for their residences. 
While returning to their homes, they talked of the dealings of King 
Yudhi�thira, and even after continuous talk of his greatness they were not 
satiated, just as one may drink nectar over and over again and never be 
satisfied. After the departure of all others, Maharaja Yudhi�thira restrained 
the inner circle of his friends, including Lord Kr��a, by not allowing them 
to leave. Lord Kr��a could not refuse the request of the King. He therefore 
sent back all the heroes of the Y adu dynasty, like Samba and others. All 
of them returned to Dvaraka, and Lord Kr��a personally remained in 
order to give pleasure to the King. 
In the material world, everyone has a particular type of desire to be 
fulfilled, but one is never able to fulfill his desires to his full satisfaction. 
But King Yudhi�thira, because of his unflinching devotion to Kr§!la, could 
fulfill all his desires successfully by the performance of the Rajasiiya 
yajfia. From the description of the execution of the Rajasiiya yajfia, it 
appears that such a function is a great ocean of opulent desires. It is not 
possible for an ordinary man to cross over such an ocean; nevertheless, by 
the grace of Lord Kr§!la, King Yudhi§thira was able to cross over it very 
easily, and thus he became freed from all anxieties. 
When Duryodhana saw that Maharaja Yudhi�thira had become very 
famous after performance of the Rajasiiya yajfia and was fully satisfied in 
every respect, he began to burn with the fire of envy because his mind was 
always poisonous. For one thing, he envied the imperial palace which had 
been constructed by the demon Maya for the Pa!!9avas. The palace was 
excellent in its puzzling artistic workmanship and was befitting the posi­
tion of great princes, kings or leaders of the demons. In that great palace, 
the Pa�9avas were living with their family members, and Queen Draupadi 
was serving her husbands very peacefully. And because in those days 
Lord Kr��a was also there, the palace was also decorated by His thou­
sands of queens. When the queens, with their heavy breasts and thin 
waists, moved within the palace, and their ankle bells rang very melodiously 
with their movement, the whole palace appeared to be more opulent than 
Why Duryodhana Felt Insulted 
151 
the heavenly kingdoms. Because a portion of their breasts was sprinkled 
with saffron powder, the pearl necklaces on their breast appeared to be 
reddish. With their full earrings and flowing hair, the queens appeared very 
beautiful. After looking at such beauties in the palace of King Yudhi�thira, 
Duryodhana became envious. He became especially envious and lustful 
upon seeing the beauty of Draupadi because he had cherished a special 
attraction for her from the very beginning of her marriage with the Pa!J.­
cjavas. In the marriage selection assembly of Draupadi, Duryodhana had 
also been present, and with other princes he had been very much captivated 
by the beauty of Draupadi, but had failed to achieve her. 
Once upon a time, King Yudhi�thira was sitting on the golden throne in 
the palace constructed by the demon Maya. His four brothers and other 
relatives, as well as his great well-wisher, the Supreme Personality of God­
head, Kr�!J.a, were present and the material opulence of King Yudhi�thira 
seemed no less than that of Lord Brahma. When he was sitting on the 
throne surrounded by his friends, and the reciters were offering prayers to 
him in the form of nice songs, Duryodhana, with his younger brother, came 
to the palace. Duryodhana was decorated with a helmet, and he carried_ a 
sword in his hand. He was always in an envious and angry mood, and 
therefore, on a slight provocation, he spoke sharply with the doorkeepers 
and became angry. He was irritated because he failed to distinguish be­
tween water and land. By the craftmanship of the demon Maya, the palace 
was so decorated in .different places that one who did not know the tricks 
would consider water to be land and land to be water. Duryodhana was 
also illusioned by this craftmanship, and when he was crossing water 
thinking it to be land, he fell down. When Duryodhana, out of his fool­
lishness, had thus fallen, the queens enjoyed the incident by laughing. 
King Yudhi�thira, could understand the feelings of Duryodhana, and he 
tried to restrain the queens from laughing, but Lord Kr�!la indicated that 
King Yudhi�thira should not restrain them from enjoying the incident: 
Kr�!la desired that Duryodhana might be fooled in that way and that all of 
them might enjoy his foolish behavior. When everyone laughed, Duryo­
dhana felt very insulted, and his hair stood up in anger. Being thus insulted, 
he immediately left the palace, bowing his head. He was silent and did not 
protest. When Duryodhana left in such an angry mood, everyone regretted 
the incident, and King Yudhi�thira also became very sorry. But despite all 
occurrences, Kr�!la was silent. He did not say anything against or in favor 
of the incident. It appeared that Duryodhana had been put into illusion by 
the supreme will of Lord Kr�!J.a, and this was the beginning of the enmity 
between the two sects of the Kuru dynasty. It appeared that it was a part

Kr��a, the Supreme Personality of Godhead 
of Kr��a 's plan in His mission to decrease the burden of the world. 
King PanK�it had inquired from Sukadeva Gosvami as to why Duryo­
dhana was not satisfied after the termination of the great Rajasiiya 
sacrifice, and thus it was explained by Sukadeva Gosvami. 
Thus ends the Bhaktivedanta purport of the Second Volume, Twentieth 
Chapter, of Kr��a, "Why Duryodhana Felt Insulted at the End of the 
Riijasuya Sacrifice." 
21 I The Battle Between Salva 
and the Members of the Y adu Dynasty 
While Sukadeva Gosvami was narrating various activities of Lord Kr�!la 
in playing the role of an ordinary human being, he also narrated the 
history of the battle between the dynasty of Y adu and a demon of the 
name Salva, who had managed to possess a wonderful airship named 
Saubha. King Salva was a great friend of Sisupala's. When Sisupala went to 
marry Rukmi!J.i, Salva was one of the members of the bridegroom's party. 
When there was a fight between the soldiers of the Y adu dynasty and the 
kings of the opposite side, Salva was defeated by the soldiers of the Y adu 
dynasty. But, despite his defeat, he made a promise before all the kings 
that he would in the future rid the whole world of all the members of the 
Yadu dynasty. Since his defeat in the fight during the marriage of Rukmi!J.i, 
he had maintained within himself an unforgettable envy of Lord Krwa, and 
he was, in fact, a fool, because he had promised to kill Kr�!J.a. 
Usually such foolish demons take shelter of a demigod like Lord Siva to 
execute their ulterior plans, and so Salva, in order to get strength, took 
shelter of the lotus feet of Lord Siva. He underwent a severe type of 
austerity during which he would eat no more than a handful of ash«:s 
daily. Lord Siva, the husband of Parvati, is generally very merciful, and he 
becomes very quickly satisfied if someone undertakes severe austerities in 
order to please him. So after continued austerities by Salva for one year, 
Lord Siva became pleased with him and asked him to beg for the fulfillment 
of his desire. 
Salva begged from Lord Siva the gift of an airplane which would be so 
strong that it could not be destroyed by any demigod, demon, human 
being, Gandharva, Naga, or even by any Rak�asa. Moreover, he desired 
that the airplane be able to fly anywhere and everywhere he would like to 
pilot it, and be specifically very dangerous and fearful to the dynasty of 
the Y adus. Lord Siva immediately agreed to give him the benediction, and 
153 
154 
Kr��a, the Supreme Personality of Godhead 
Salva took the help of the demon Maya to manufacture this iron airplane, 
which was so strong and formidable that no one could crash it. It was a 
very big machine, almost like a big city, and it could fly so high and at 
such a great speed that it was almost impossible to see where it was, and so 
there was no question of attacking it. Although it might be dark outside, 
the pilot could fly it anywhere and everywhere. Having acquired such a 
wonderful airplane, Salva flew it to the city of Dvaraka, because his main 
purpose in obtaining the airplane was to attack the city of the Yadus, 
toward whom he maintained a continual feeling of animosity. 
Salva thus not only attacked the city of Dvaraka from the sky, but he 
also surrounded the city by a large number of infantry. The soldiers on the 
surface began to attack the beautiful spots of the city. They began to 
destroy the baths, the city gates, the palaces and the skyscraper houses, the 
high walls around the city and the beautiful spots where people would 
gather for recreation. While the soldiers were attacking on the surface, the 
airplane began to drop big slabs of stone, tree trunks, thunderbolts, 
poisonous snakes and many other dangerous things. Salva also managed to 
create such a strong whirlwind within the city that ail of Dvaraka became 
dark because of the dust that covered the sky. The airplane occupied by 
Salva put the entire city of Dvaraka into distress equal to that caused on 
the earth long, long ago by the disturbing activities of Tripurasura. The 
inhabitants of Dvaraka Purl became so harrassed that they were not in a 
peaceful condition for even a moment. 
The great heroes of Dvaraka City, headed by commanders such as 
Pradyumna, counterattacked the soldiers and the airplane of Salva. When 
he saw the extreme distress of the citizens, Pradyumna immediately 
arranged his soldiers and personally got upon a chariot, encouraging the 
citizens by assuring safety. Following his command, many warriors like 
Satyaki, Carude�v.a and Samba, all young brothers of Pradyumna, as well 
as Akriira, Krtavarma, Bhanuvinda, Gada, Suka and Sarana-all came out of 
the city to fight with Salva. All of them were great fighters; each one 
could fight with thousands of men. All were fully equipped with necessary 
weapons and assisted by hundreds and thousands of charioteers, elephants, 
horses and infantry soldiers. Fierce fighting began between the two 
parties, exactly as was formerly carried on between the demigods 
and the demons. The fighting was very severe, and whoever observed the 
fierce nature of the fight felt his hairs stand on end. 
Pradyumna immediately counteracted the mystic demonstration occa­
sioned by the airplane of Salva, the King of Saubha. By the mystic power 
of the airplane, Salva had created a darkness as dense as night, but 
Pradyumna all of a sudden appeared like the rising sun. As with the rising 
The Battle Between Salva and the Y adu Dynasty 
155 
of the sun the darkness of night is immediately dissipated, so with the 
appearance of Pradyumna the power exhibited by Salva became null and 
void. Each and every one of Pradyumna 's arrows had a golden feather at 
the end, and the shaft was fitted with a sharp iron edge. By releasing 
twenty-five such arrows, Pradyumna severely injured Salva's commander­
in-chief. He then released another one hundred arrows toward the body of 
Salva. After this, he pierced each and every soldier by releasing one arrow, 
and he killed the chariot drivers by firing ten arrows at each one of them. 
The carriers like the horses and elephants were killed by the release of 
three arrows directed toward each one of them. When everyone present on 
the battlefield saw this wonderful feat of Pradyumna, the great fighters on 
both the sides began to praise his acts of chivalry. 
But still the airplane occupied by Salva was very mysterious. It was so 
extraordinary that sometimes there would appear to be many airplanes in 
the sky, and sometimes it would be seen that there was none. Sometimes 
it was visible, and sometimes it was not visible, and the warriors of the Y adu 
dynasty became puzzled about the whereabouts of the peculiar airplane. 
Sometimes they would see the airplane on the ground, and sometimes 
they would see it flying in the sky. Sometimes they would see the airplane 
resting on the peak of a hill, and sometimes it was seen floating on the 
water. The wonderful airplane was flying in the sky like a firefly in the 
wind-it was not steady even for a moment. But despite the mysterious 
maneuvering of the airplane, the commanders and the soldiers of the 
Y adu dynasty would immediately rush toward Salva wherever he was 
present with his airplane and soldiers. The arrows released by the dynasty 
of the Y adus were as brilliant as the sun and as dangerous as the tongues 
of serpents. All the soldiers fighting on behalf of Salva became soon dis­
tressed by the incessant release of arrows upon them by the heroes of the 
Y adu dynasty, and Salva himself became. unconscious from the attack of 
these arrows. 
The soldiers and the fighters fighting on behalf of Salva were also very 
strong, and the release of their arrows also harassed the heroes of the 
Yadu dynasty. But still the Yadus were so strong and determined that 
they did not move from their strategic positions. The heroes of the Y adu 
dynasty were determined to either die in the battlefield or gain victory. 
They were confident of the fact that if they would die in the fighting they 
would attain a heavenly pl_anet, and if they would come out victorious 
they would enjoy the world. The name of Salva's commander-in-chief was 
Dyuman. He was very powerful, and although bitten by twenty-five of 
Pradyumna's arrows, he suddenly attacked Pradyumna with his fierce 
156 
.Kf�!la, the Supreme Personality of Godhead 
club and struck him so strongly that Pradyumna became unconscious. 
Immediately there was a roaring, "Now he is dead! Now he is dead!" The 
force of the club on the chest of Pradyumna was very severe, enough to 
tear asunder the chest of an ordinary man. 
Pradyumna's chariot was being driven by the son of Daruka. According 
to Vedic military principles, the chariot driver and the hero on the chariot 
have to cooperate during the fighting. As such, it was the duty of the 
chariot driver to take care of the hero on the chariot during the dangerous 
and precarious fighting on the battlefield. Thus Daruka removed the body 
of Pradyumna from the battlefield. Two hours later, in a quiet place, 
Pradyumna regained his consciousness, and when he saw that he was in a 
place other than the battlefield he addressed the charioteer and condemned 
him: 
"Oh, you have done the most abominable act! Why have you moved me 
from the battlefield? My dear charioteer, I have never heard that anyone 
in our family was ever removed from the battlefield. None of them left 
the battlefield while fighting. By this removal you have overburdened me 
with a great defamation. It will be said that I left ·the battlefield while 
fighting was going on. My dear charioteer, I must accuse you-you are a 
coward and emasculator! Tell me, how can I go before my uncle Balarama 
and before my father Kr�!J.a, and what shall I say before them? Everyone 
will talk about me and say that I fled from the fighting place, and if they 
inquire from me about this, what will be my reply? My sisters-in-law will 
play jokes upon me with sarcastic words: 'My dear hero, how have you 
become such a coward? How have you become a eunuch? How have you 
become so low in the eyes of the fighters who opposed you?' I think, my 
dear charioteer, that you have committed a great offense by removing me 
from the battlefield." 
The charioteer of Pradyumna replied, "My dear sir, I wish a long life for 
you. I think I did not do anything wrong, as it is the duty of the charioteer 
to help the fighter in the chariot when he is in a precarious condition. My 
dear sir, you are completely competent in the battlefield activities. It is 
the mutual duty of the charioteer and the warrior to give protection to 
each other in a precarious condition. I was completely aware of the 
regulative principles of fighting, and I did my duty. The enemy all of a 
sudden struck you with his club so severely that you lost consciousness. 
You were in a dangerous position, surrounded by your enemies. Therefore 
I was obliged to act as I did." 
Thus ends the Bhaktivedanta purport of the Second Volume, Twenty­
first chapter, of Kf§!J.a, "The Battle between Salva and the Members of the 
Yadu Dynasty." 
22 I The Deliverance of Salva 
After talking with his charioteer, the son of Daruka, Pradyumna could 
understand the real circumstances, and therefore he refreshed himself by 
washing his mouth and hands. Arming himself properly with bows and 
arrows, he asked his charioteer to take him near the place where Salva's 
commander-in-chief was standing. During the short absence of Pradyumna 
from the battlefield, Dyuman, Salva's commander-in-chief, had been taking 
over the position of the soldiers of the Y adu dynasty. By appearing in the 
battlefield, Pradyumna immediately stopped him and struck him with 
eight arrows. With four arrows he killed his four horses, with one arrow he 
killed his chariot driver and with another arrow he cut his bow in two; 
with another arrow, he cut his flag into pieces, and with another he severed 
his head from his body. 
On the other fronts, heroes like Gada, Satyaki and Samba were engaged 
in killing the soldiers of Salva. The soldiers who were staying with Salva in 
the airplane were also killed in the fighting, and they fell into the ocean. 
Each party began to strike the opposite party very severely. The battle was 
fierce and dangerous and continued for twenty-seven days without stop. 
While the fight was going on in the city of Dvaraka, Kf�l)a was staying at 
lndraprastha along with the Pal)�avas and King Yudhi�thira. This fighting 
with Salva took place after the Rajasiiya yajiia had been performed by 
King Yudhi�thira and after the killing of Sisupala. When Lord Kr�l)a 
understood that there was great danger in the city of Dvaraka, He took 
permission from the elderly members of the Pal)�ava family, especially 
from his aunt Kuntidevi� and started immediately for Dvaraka. 
Lord Kf�l)a began to think that while He was arriving in Hastinapura 
with Balarama after the killing of Sisupala, Sisupala's men must have 
attacked Dvaraka. On reaching Dvaraka, Lord Kr�!la saw that the whole 
city was greatly endangered. He placed Balaramaji in a strategic position 
for the protection of the city, and He Himself asked His charioteer Daruka 
157 
158 
Kr��a, the Supreme Personality of Godhead 
to prepare to start. He said, "Daruka, please immediately take Me to where 
Salva is staying. You may know that this Salva is a very powerful, 
mysterious man. Don't fear him in the least." As soon as he got his orders 
from Lord Kr��a, Daruka had Him seated on the chariot and drove very 
quickly toward Salva. 
The chariot of Lord Kr��a was marked with the flag bearing the 
insignia of Garu�a, and as soon as the soldiers and warriors of the Y adu 
dynasty saw the flag, they could understand that Lord Kr��a was on the 
battlefield. By this time, almost all the soldiers of Salva had been killed, 
but when Salva saw that Kr��a had come to the battlefield, he released a 
great, powerful weapon which flew through the sky with a roaring sound 
like a great meteor. It was so bright that the whole sky lit up by its 
presence. But as soon as Lord Kr��a appeared, He tore the great weapon 
into hundreds and thousands of pieces by releasing His own arrow. 
Lord Kr��a struck Salva with sixteen arrows, and with showers of arrows 
over_powers

struck 
a severe blow to Kr��a's left side, where the Lord was carrying ·His bow, 
Sarriga, and as a result the Sarriga bow fell from Lord Kr��a 's hand. This 
dropping of the bow was indeed wonderful. Great personalities and demi­
gods who were observing the fighting between Salva and Kr��a became 
most perturbed by this, and they began to exclaim, "Alas! Alas!" 
Salva thought that he had become victorious, and with a roaring sound 
began to address Lord Kr��a as follows: "You rascal, Kr��a! You kid­
napped Rukmi�i forcibly, even in our presence. You baffled my friend 
Sisupala and married Rukmi�i Yourself. And in the great assembly at King 
Yudhi�thira's Rajasiiya yajiia, while my friend Sisupala was a little absent­
minded, You took an opportunity to kill him. Everyone thinks that You 
are a great fighter and that no one can conquer You. So now You'll have 
to prove Your strength. I think that if You stand before me any longer, 
with my sharpened arrows I shall send You to a place wherefrom You will 
never return." 
" 
To this Lord Kr��a replied, "Foolish Salva, you are talking nonsensically. 
You do not know that the moment of death is already upon your head. 
Those who are actually heroes do not talk much. They prove their prowess 
by practical exhibition of chivalrous activities." Mter saying this, Lord 
Kr��a, in great anger, struck Salva on the collarbone with His club so severe­
ly that he began to bleed internally and tremble as if he were ·going to 
collapse from severe cold. Before Kr��a was able to strike him again, 
however, Salva became invisible by his mystic power. 
The Deliverance of Salva 
159 
Within a few moments, a mysterious unknown man came before Lord 
Krwa. Crying loudly, he bowed down at the Lord's lotus feet and said to 
Him, "Since You are the most beloved son of Your father Vasudeva, Your 
mother Devaki has sent me to inform You of the unfortunate news that 
Your father has been arrested by Salva and taken away by force. He took 
him just as a butcher mercilessly takes away an animal." When Lord Kr�!la 
heard this unfortunate news from the unknown man, He at first became 
most perturbed, just like an ordinary human being. His face showed signs 
of grief, and He began to cry in a pitious tone, "How could that happen? 
My brother Lord Balarama is there, and it is impossible for anyone to 
conquer Balaramaji. He is in charge of Dvaraka City, and I know He is 
always alert. How could Salva possibly enter the city and arrest My father 
in that way? Whatever he may be, Salva's power is limited, so how could it 
be possible that he has conquered the strength of Balaramaji and 
taken away My father, arresting him as described by this man? Alas! 
Destiny is, after all, very powerful." 
While Sri Kr�!la was thinking like this, Salva brought before Him in 
custody a man exactly resembling Vasudeva, His father. These were all 
creations of the mystic power of Salva. 
Salva began to address Kr�!la, "You rascal, Kr�!la! Look. This is Your 
father who has begotten You and by whose mercy You are still living. 
Now just see how I kill Your father. If You have any strength, try to save 
him." The mystic juggler, Salva, speaking in this way before Lord Kr�!la, 
immediately cut off the head of the false Vasudeva. Without hesitation 
he took away the dead body and got into his airplane. Lord Kr�!la is the 
self-sufficient Supreme Personality of Godhead, yet because He was playing 
the role of a human being, He became very depressed for a moment, as if 
He had actually lost His father. But at the next moment He.could under­
stand that the arrest and killing of His father were demonstrations of the 
mystic powers which Salva had learned from the demon Maya. Coming to 
His right consciousness, He could see that there was no messenger and no 
head of His father, but that only Salva had left in his airplane, which was 
flying in the sky. He then began to think of slaying Salva. 
Kr�!la's reaction is a controversial point among great authorities and 
saintly persons. How could Kr�!la, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, 
the reservoir of all power and knowledge, be bewildered in such a way? 
Lamentation, aggrievement and bewilderment are characteristics of persons 
who are conditioned souls, but how can such things affect the person of 
the Supreme, who is full of knowledge, power and all opulence? Actually, 
it is not at all possible that Lord Kr�!la was misled by the mystic jugglery 
160 
Kr��a, the Supreme Personality of Godhead 
of Salva. He was displaying His pastime. in playing the role of a human 
being. Great saintly persons and sages who are engaged in the devotional 
service of the lotus feet of Lord Kr�:pa and who have thus achieved the 
greatest perfection of self-realization have transcended the bewilderments 
of the bodily concept of life. Lord Kr�:pa is the ultimate goal of life for 
such saintly persons. How then could Kr��a have been bewildered by the 
mystic jugglery of Salva? The conclusion is that Lord Kr�:pa's bewilderment 
was another opulence of His supreme personality. 
When Salva thought that Kr�:pa had been bewildered by his mystic 
representations, he became encouraged and began to attack the Lord with 
greater strength and energy by showering volumes of arrows upon Him. 
But the enthusiasm of Salva can be compared to the speedy march of flies 
into a fire. Lord Kr�:pa, by hurling His arrows with unfathomable strength, 
injured Salva, whose armor, bow and jewelled helmet all scattered into 
pieces. With a crashing blow from Kr�:pa's club, Salva's wonderful airplane 
burst into pieces and fell into the sea. Salva was very careful, and instead 
of crashing with the airplane, he managed to jump onto the land. He again 
rushed towards Lord Kr��a. When Salva ran swiftly to attack Kr�:pa with 
His club, Lord Kr�:pa cut off his hand, which fell to the ground with the 
club. Finally deciding to kill him, the Lord took up His wonderful disc, 
which was shining like the brilliant sun at the time of the dissolution of the 
material creation. When Lord Sri Kr�:pa stood up with His disc to kill 
Salva, He appeared just like the red sun rising over a mountain. Lord Krwa 
then cut off his head, and the head, with its earrings and helmet, fell on 
the ground. Salva was thus killed in the same way as V rtrasura was killed 
by Indra, the King of heaven. 
When Salva was killed, all his soldiers and followers began to cry, "Alas! 
Alas!" While Salva's men were thus crying, the demigods from the heavenly 
planets showered flowers on Kr�:pa and announced the victory by beating 
on drums and blowing bugles. At this very moment, other friends of 
Sisupala, such as Dantavakra, appeared on the scene to fight with Kr�:pa 
in order to avenge the death of Sisupala. When Dantavakra appeared 
before Lord Kr§�a, he was extremely angry. 
Thus ends the Bhaktivedanta· purport of the Second Volume, Twenty­
second Chapter, of Kr��a, "The Deliverance of Siilva." 
23 I The Killing of Dantavakra, 
Vidiiratha and Romaharsana 
• 
• 
After the demise of Sisupala, Salva and Pau!J.9ra, another foolish de­
moniac king of the name Dantavakra wanted to kill Kr�!la in order to 
avenge the death of his friend Salva. He became so agitated that he 
personally appeared on the battlefield without the proper arms and 
ammunition and without even a chariot. His only weapon was his great 
anger, which was red-hot. He carried only a club in his hand, but he was 
so powerful that when he moved, everyone felt the earth trem.ble. When 
Lord Kr�!la saw him approaching in a very heroic mood, He imme­
diately got down from His chariot, for it was a rule of military etiquette 
that fighting should take place only between equals. Knowing that 
Dantavakra was alone and armed with only a club, Lord Krwa responded 
similarly and prepared Himself by taking His club in His hand. When 
Kr�!la appeared before him, Dantavakra's heroic march was immediately 
stopped just as the great, furious waves of the ocean are stopped by the 
beach. 
At that time, Dantavakra, who was the King of KanJ.�a, stood up firmly 
with his club and spoke to Lord K(�!la as follows: "It is a great pleasure 
and fortunate opportunity, Kr�!J.a, that we are facing each other eye to 
eye. My dear Kr�!J.a, after all, You are my eternal cousin, and I should not 
kill You in this way, but unfortunately You have commited a great mistake 
by killing my friend Salva. Moreover, You are not satisfied by killing my 
friend, but I know that You want to kill me also. Because of Your deter­
mination, I must kill You by tearing You into pieces with my club. Kr�tta, 
although You are my relative, You are foolish. You are our greatest 
enemy, so I must kill You today just as a person removes a boil on his 
body by a surgical operation. I am always very much obliged to my friends, 
and I therefore consider myself indebted to my dear friend Salva. I can 
only liquidate my indebtedness to him by killing You." 
161

Kr�pa, the Supreme Personality of Godhead
As the caretaker of an elephant tries to control the animal by striking it 
with his trident, so Dantavakra tried to control Kf§pa simply by speaking 
strong words. After finishing his vituperation, he struck Kr§!la on the head 
with his club and made a roaring sound like a lion. Although struck 
strongly by the club of Dantavakra, Kr§!la did not move even an inch, nor 
did He feel any pain. Taking His Kaumodaki club and moving very skill­
fully, Kf§!la struck the chest of Dantavakra so fiercely that the heart of 
Dantavakra split in twain. As a result, Dantavakra began to vomit blood, 
his hairs became scattered, and he fell to the ground, spreading his hands 
and legs. Within only a few minutes all that remained of Dantavakra was a 
dead body on the ground. After the death of Dantavakra, just as at the 
time of Sisupala's death, in the presence of all persons standing there, a 
small particle of spiritual effulgence came out of the demon's body and 
very wonderfully merged into the body of Lord Kr§!la. 
Dantavakra had a brother named Vidiiratha who became overwhelmed 
with grief at the death of Dantavakra. Out of grief and anger, Vidiiratha was 
breathing very heavily, and just to avenge the death of his brother he also 
appeared before Lord Kf§!la with a sword and a shield in his hands. He 
wanted to kill Kr§!la immediately. When Lord Krwa understood that Vidii­
ratha was looking for the opportunity to strike I im with his sword, He 
employed His Sudarsana cakra, His disc, which was as sharp as a razor, and 
without delay he cut off the head of Vidiiratha, with its helmet and earrings. 
In this way, after killing Salva and destroying his wonderful airplane and 
then killing Dantavakra and Vidiiratha, Lprd Kr§!la at last entered His city, 
Dvaraka. It would not have been possible '.for anyone but Kr§!la to kill these 
great heroes, and therefore all the demigods from heaven and the human 
beings on the surface of the globe were glorifying Him. Great sages and 
ascetics, the denizens of the Siddha and Gandharva planets, the denizens 
known as Vidyadharas, Vasuki and the Mahanagas, the beautiful angels, 
the inhabitants of Pitrloka, the Y aksas, the Kinnaras and the Caranas all 
. 
. 
. 
began to shower flowers upon Him and sing the songs of His victory in 
great jubilation. Decorating the entire city very festively, the citizens of 
Dvaraka held a great celebration, and when Lord Kr§!la passed through 
the city all the members of the V f§!li dynasty and the heroes of the Y adu 
dynasty followed Him with great respect. These are some of the transcen­
dental pastimes of Lord Kr§tta, who is the master of all mystic power and 
the Lord of all cosmic manifestations. Those who are fools, who are like 
animals, sometimes think that Kr§!la is defeated, but factually He is the 
Supreme Personality of Godhead, and no one can defeat Him. He always 
remains victorious over everyone. He is the only one God, and all others 
are His subservient order carriers. 
The Killing of Dantavakra, Vidiiratha and Romahar��a 
163 
Once upon a time, Lord Balarama heard that there was an arrangement 
being made for a fight between the two rival parties in the Kuru dynasty, 
one headed by Duryodhana and the other by the Pa�c).avas. He did not 
like the idea that He was to be only a mediator to stop the fighting. Finding 
it unbearable not to take an active part on behalf of either of the parties, 
He left Dvaraka on the plea of visiting various holy places of pilgrimage. 
He first of all visited the place of pilgrimage known as Prabhasak�etra. He 
took His bath there, and He pacified the local briihmar-as and offered obla­
tions to the demigods, pitas, great sages and people in general, in accord­
ance with Vedic ritualistic ceremonies. That is the Vedic method of 
visiting holy places. After this, accompanied by some respectable briih­
mar-as, He decided to visit different places on the bank of the River 
Sarasvati. 
He gradually visited such places as P�thiidaka, Bindusara, 
Tritakiipa, Sudarsanatirtha, Visalatirtha, Brahmatirtha and Cakratirtha. 
Besides these, He also visited all the holy places on the bank of Sarasvati 
River running toward the east. After this He visited all the principal holy 
places on the bank of the Yam una and on the bank of the Ganges. Thus 
He gradually came to the holy place known as Naimi�ara�ya. 
This holy place, N aimi�ara�ya, is still existing in India, and in ancient 
times it was especially used for the meetings of great sages and saintly 
persons with the aim of understanding spiritual life and self-realization. 
When Lord Balarama visited that place there was a great sacrifice being 
performed by a great assembly of transcendentalists. Such meetings were 
planned to last thousands of ye�us. When Lord Balarama arrived, all the 
participants of the meeting-great sages, ascetics, briihmar-as and learned 
scholars-immediately arose from their seats and welcomed Him with 
great honor and respect. Some offered Him respectful obeisances, and 
those who were elderly great sages and briihmar-as offered Him blessings 
by standing up. After this formality, Lord Balarama was offered a suitable 
seat, and everyone present worshiped Him. Everyone in the assembly stood 
up in the presence of Balarama because they knew Him to be the Supreme 
Personality of Godhead. Education or learning means to understand the 
Supreme Personality of Godhead; therefore, although Lord Balarama 
appeared on the earth as a k§atriya, all the briihmar-as and sages stood up 
because they knew who Lord Balarama was. 
Unfortunately, after being worshiped and seated at His place, Lord 
Balarama saw Romahar�a�a, the disciple of Vyasadeva (the literary incar­
nation of Godhead), still sitting on the Vyasasana. He had neither gotten 
up from his seat nor offered Him respects. Because he was seated on the 
Vyasasana, he foolishly thought himself greater than the Lord; therefore 
he did not get down from his seat or bow down before the Lord. Lord 
164 
Kr�!ia, the Supreme Personality of Godhead 
Balarama then considered the history of Romahar§a!la: he was born in a 
suta family or a mixed family, born of a briihmar-a woman and k§atriya 
man. Therefore although Romahar§a!la considered Balarama a k§atriya, 
he should not have remained sitting on a higher seat. Lord Balarama 
considered that Romahar§ap.a, according to his position by birth, should 
not have accepted the higher sitting position, because there were many 
learned briihmar-as and sages present. He also observed that Romahar§ap.a 
not only did not come down from his exalted seat, but he did not even 
stand up and offer his respects when Balaramaji entered the assembly. 
Lord Baladima did not like the audacity of Romahar§ap.a, and he became 
very angry with him. 
When a person is seated on the Vyasasana, he does not generally have to 
stand up to receive a particular person entering the assembly, but in this 
case the situation was different because Lord Baladeva is not an ordinary 
human being. Therefore, although Romahar§ap.a Siita was voted to the 
Vyasasana by all the briihmar-as, he should have followed the behavior of 
other learned sages and briihmar-as who were present and should have 
known that Lord Balarama is the Supreme Personality of Godhead. 
Respects are always due to Him, even though such respects can be avoided 
in the case of an ordinary man. The appearances of Kr§p.a and Balarama 
are especially meant for reestablishment of the religious principles. As 
stated in the Bhagavad-gitii, the highest religious principle is to surrender 
unto the Supreme Personality of Godhead. It is also confirmed in the 
Srimad-Bhagavatam that the topmost perfection of religiousness is to be 
engaged in the devotional service of the Lord. 
When Lord Balarama saw that Romahar§a!la Siita did not understand 
the highest principle of religiousness in spite of having studied all the 
Vedas, He certainly could not support his position. Romahar§a!la Siita had 
been given a chance to become a perfect briihmar-a, but because of his ill 
behavior in his relationship with the Supreme Personality of Godhead, his 
low birth was immediately remembered. Romahar§a!la Siita had been 
given the position of a briihmar-a, but he had not been born in the family 
of a briihmar-a; he had been born in a pratiloma family. According to the 
Vedic concept, there are two kinds of mixed family heritage. They are 
called anuloma and pratiloma. When a male is united with a female of a 
lower caste, the offspring is called anuloma; but when a male unites with 
a woman of a higher caste, the offspring is called pratiloma. Romahar§ap.a 
Siita belonged to the pratiloma family because his father was a k§atriya 
and his mother a briihmar-a. 
Because Romahar§ap.a's transcendental 
realization was not perfect, Lord Balarama remembered his pratiloma 
heritage. The idea is that any man can be given the chance to become a 
The Killing of Dantavakra, Vidiiratha and Romahar�a!la 
165 
briihmar-a, but if he improperly uses the position of a briihmar-a without 
actual realization, then his elevation to the brahminical position is not 
valid. 
After seeing the deficiency of realization in Romahar�av.a Siita, Lord 
Balarama decided to chastise him for being puffed up. Lord Balarama. 
therefore said, "This man is liable to be awarded the death punishment 
because, although he has the good qualification of being a disciple of 
Lord Vyasadeva and although he has studied all the Vedic literature from 
this exalted personality, he was not submissive in the presence of the 
Supreme Personality of Godhead." As stated in the Bhagavad-gitii, a person 
who is actually a briihmar-a and is very learned must automatically become 
very gentle also. In the case of Romahar�av.a Siita, although he was very 
learned and had been given the chance to become a briihmar-a, he had not 
become gentle. From this we can understand that when one is puffed up 
by material acquisition, he cannot acquire the gentle behavior befitting a 
briihmar-a. The learning of such a person is as good as a valuable jewel 
decorating the hood of a serpent. Despite the valuable jewel on the hood, 
a serpent is still a serpent and is as fearful as an ordinary serpent. If a 
person does not become meek and humble, all his studies of the Vedas 
and Puriir-as and his vast knowledge in the siistras become simply outward 
dress, like the costume of a theatrical artist dancing on the stage. Lord 
Balarama began to consider thus: "I have appeared in order to chastise 
false persons who are internally impure but externally pose themselves to 
be very learned and religious. My killing of such persons is proper to check 
them from further sinful activity." 
Lord Balarama had avoided taking part in the Battle of Kuruk�etra, 
and yet because of His position, the reestablishment of religious principles 
was his prime duty. Considering these points, He killed Romahar�a!la 
Siita simply by striking him with a kusa straw, which was nothing but a 
blade of grass. If someone questions how Lord Balarama could kill. 
Romahar�a!la Siita simply by striking him with a blade of kusa grass, the
answer is given in the Srimad-Bhiigavatam by the use of the word prabhu 
(master). The Lord's position is always transcendental, and because He is 
omnipotent He can act as He likes without being obliged to the material 
laws and principles. Thus it was possible for Him to kill Romahar�a!la Siita 
simply by striking him with a blade of kusa grass. 
At the death of Romahar�av.a Siita, everyone present became much 
aggrieved, and there was roaring and crying. Although all the briihmar-as 
and sages present there knew Lord Balarama to be the Supreme Person­
ality of Godhead, they did not hesitate to protest the Lord's action, and 
they humbly submitted, "Our dear Lord, we think that Your action is not 
L 
166 
Kr��a, the Supreme Personality of Godhead 
in line with the religious principles. Dear Lord Y adunandana, we may 
inform You that we briihmar-as posted Romahar�a�a Siita on that exalted 
position for the duration of this great sacrifice. He was seated on the 
Vyasasana by our election, and when one is seated on the Vyasasana, it is 
improper for him to stand up to receive a person. Moreover, we awarded 
Romahar�a�a Siita an undisturbed duration of life. Under the circum­
stances, since Your Lordship has killed him without knowing all these 
facts, we think that Your action has been equal to that of killing a briih­
mar-a. Dear Lo�d, deliverer of all fallen souls, we know certainly that You 
are the knower of all Vedic principles. You are the master of all mystic 
powers; therefore ordinarily the Vedic injunctions cannot be applied to 
Your personality. But we request that You show Your causeless mercy 
upon others by kindly atoning for this killing of Romahar�a�a Siita. We 
do not, however, suggest what kind of act You should perform to atone 
for killing him; we simply suggest that some method of atonement be 
adopted by You so that others may follow Your action. What is done by 
a great personality is followed by the ordinary man." 
The Lord replied, "Yes, I must atone for tl;tis action, which may have 
been proper for Me, but is improper for others; therefore, I think it is My 
duty to execute a suitable act of atonement enjoined in the authorized 
scriptures. Simultaneously I can also give this Romahar§a�a Siita life 
again, with a span of long duration, sufficient strength, and full power 
of the senses. Not only this, if you desire, I shall be glad to award 
him anything else which you may ask. I shall be very glad to grant all 
these boons in order to fulfill your desires." 
This statement of Lord Balarama definitely confirms that the Supreme 
Personality of Godhead is free to act in any way. Although it may be 
considered that His killing of Romahar�atta Siita was improper, He could 
immediately counteract the action with- greater profit to all. Therefore, 
one should not imitate the actions of the Supreme Personality of God­
head; one should simply follow the instructions of the Lord. All the great 
learned sages present realized that although they considered the action of 
Lord Balarama to be improper, the Lord was able to immediately compen­
sate with greater profits. Not wanting to detract from the mission of the 
Lord in killing Romahar§atta Siita, all of them prayed, "Our dear Lord, the 
uncommon use of Your kusa weapon to kill Romahar�atta Siita may remain 
as it is; because of Your' desire to kil! him, he should not be brought to 
life again. At the same time Your Lordship may remember that we sages 
and briihmar-as voluntarily gave him long life; therefore, such a benediction 
should not be nullified." Thus the request of all the learned briihmar-as in 
The Killing of Dantavakra, Vidiiratha and Romahar�a!la 
167 
the assembly was ambiguous because they wanted to keep intact the 
benediction given by them that Romahar�a�a Siita would continue to 
live until the end of the great sacrifice, but at the same time they did not 
want to nullify Balarama's killing him .. 
The Supreme Personality of Godhead therefore solved the problem in a· 
manner befitting His exalted position, and said, "Because the son is pro­
duced from the body of the father, it is the injunction of the Vedas that 
the son is the father's representative. Therefore I say that Ugrasrava Siita, 
the son of Romahar�a!la Siita, should henceforth take his father's position 
and continue the discourses on the Puriirws, and because you wanted 
Romahar�a!la to have a long duration of life, this benediction will be 
transferred to his son. The son, Ugrasrava, will therefore have all the 
facilities you offered-long duration of life in a good and healthy body, 
without any disturbances and full strength of all the senses. 
Lord Balarama then implored all the sages and briihma!las that aside 
from the benediction offered to the son of Romahar�a!la, they should 
ask from Him any other benediction, and He would be prepared to fulfill 
it immediately. The Lord thus placed Himself in the position of an ordi­
nary k§atriya and informed the sages that He did not know in what way 
He could atone for His killing of Romahar�a�a, but whatever they would 
suggest He would be glad to accept. 
The briihma!las could understand the purpose of the Lord, and thus, 
they suggested that 1-le atone for His action in a manner which would be 
beneficial for them. They said, "Our dear Lord, there is a demon of the 
name Balvala. He is the son of Ilvala, but he is a very powerful demon, and 
he visits this sacred place of sacrifice every fortnight on the full moon 
and moonless days and creates a great disturbance to the discharge of our 
duties in the sacrifice. 0 descendant of the Dasarha family, we all request 
You to kill this demon. We think that if You kindly kill him, that will be 
Your atonement on our behalf. The demon occasionally comes here and 
profusely throws upon us contaminated, impure things like puss, blood, 
stool, urine and wine, and he pollutes this sacred place by showering such 
filth upon us. After killing Balvala, You may continue touring all these 
sacred places of pilgrimage for twelve months, and in that way You will 
be completely freed from all contamination. That is our prescription." 
Thus ends the Bhaktivedanta purport of the Second Volume, Twenty­
third Chapter, 
of Kr��a, 
"The Killing 
of Dantavakra, 
Vidfiratha and 
Romahar§a!la."

J 
24 I The Liberation of Balvala, and Lord 
Balarama's Touring the Sacred Places 
Lord Balarama prepared Himself to meet the demon Balvala. At the 
time when the demon usually attacked the sacred place, there appeared 
a great hailstorm, the whole sky became covered with dust and the atmos­
phere became surcharged with a filthy smell. Just after this, the mischievous 
demon Balvala began to shower torrents of stool and urine and other 
impure substances on the arena of sacrifice. After this onslaught, the demon 
himself appeared with a great trident in his hand. He was a gigantic person, 
and his black body was like a huge mass of carbon. His hair, his beard and 
his moustache appeared reddish, like copper, and because of his great beard 
and moustache, his mouth appeared to be very dangerous and fierce. 
As soon as He saw the demon, Lord Balarama prepared to attack him. 
He first began to consider how He could smash the great demon to pieces. 
Lord Balarama called for His plow and club, and they immediately 
appeared before Him. The demon Balvala was flying in the sky, and at the 
first opportunity Lord Balarama dragged him down with His plow and 
angrily smashed the demon's head with His �lub. By Balarama's striking, 
the forehead of the demon became fractured. There was a profuse flow of 
blood from his forehead, and he began to scream loudly. In this way the 
demon, who had been such a great disturbance to the pious briihmapas, fell 
to the ground. His falling was like a great mountain with a red oxide peak 
being struck by a thunderbolt and smashed to the ground. 
The inhabitants of Naimi§ara!lya, learned sages and briihmarws, became 
most pleased by seeing this, and they offered their respectful prayers to 
Lord Balarama. They offered their heartfelt blessings upon the Lord, and 
all agreed that Lord Balarama's attempt to do anything would never be 
a failure. The sages and briihmaT)aS then performed a ceremonial bathing 
of Lord Balara.ma, just as King Indra is bathed by the demigods when he 
is victorious over the demons. The briihmal)aS and sages honored Lord 
168 
Lord Balarama's Touring the Sacred Places 
169 
Balarama by presenting Him first-class new clothing and ornaments and 
the lotus flower garland of victory, the reservoir of all beauty, which was 
never to be dried up, being in everlasting existence. 
After this incidence, Lord Balarama took permission from the briihmap,as 
assembled at Naimi�aragya and, accompanied by other briihmartas, went 
to the bank of the River Kau�iki. After taking His bath in this holy place, 
He proceeded toward the River Sarayu and visited the source of the river. 
He began to travel on the bank of the Sarayu River, and He gradually 
reached Prayaga, where there is a confluence of three rivers, the Ganges, 
Yamuna and Sarasvati. Here also He regularly took His bath, worshiped the 
local temples of God and, as it is enjoined in the Vedic literature, offered 
oblations to the forefathers and sages. He gradually reached the iisrama of 
the sage Pulaha and from there went to Gag�aki on the River Gomati 
After this He took His bath in the River Vipasa. Then gradually He came to 
the bank of the Soga River. (The Soga River is still running as one of the 
big rivers in the Behar Province.) He also took His bath there and 
performed the Vedic ritualistic ceremonies. He continued His travels and 
gradually came to the pilgrimage city of Gaya where there is a celebrated 
Vi�gu temple. According to the advice of His father Vasudeva, He offered 
oblations to the forefathers in this Vi�gu temple. From here He traveled to 
the delta of the Ganges, where the sacred River Ganges mixes with the Bay 
of Bengal. This sacred place is called Gangasagara, and at the end of 
January every year there is still a great assembly of saintly persons and 
pious men, just as there is an assembly of saintly persons in Prayaga every 
year which is called the Magh Mela Fair. 
After finishing His bathing and ritualistic ceremonies at Gangasagara, 
Lord Balarama proceeded toward the mountain known as Mahendra 
Parvata. At this place He met Parasurama, the incarnation of Lord Kr�ga, 
and He offered him respect by bowing down before him. After this He 
gradually turned toward southern India and visited the banks of the River 
Godavari. After taking His bath in the River Godavari and performing the 
necessary ritualistic ceremonies, He gradually visited the other rivers-the 
Vega, Pampa and Bhimarathi. On the bank of the River Bhimarathi there 
is the deity called Svami Karttikeya. After visiting Karttikeya Lord 
Balarama gradually proceeded to Sailapura, a pilgrimage city in the prov­
ince of Mahara�tra. Sailapura is one of the biggest districts in Mahara�tra 
Province. He then gradually proceeded towards the Dravi�adesa. Southern 
India is divided into five parts, called Paficadravi�a. Northern India 
is also divided into five parts, called Paficagaura. All the important 
iiciiryas 
of 
the 
modern 
age, 
namely 
Sankaracarya, 
Ramanujacarya, 
170 
Kr��a, the Supreme Personality of Godhead 
Madhvacarya, V.i��usvami, and Nimbarka, advented themselves in these 
Dravi�a Provinces. Lord Caitanya appeared in Bengal, which is part of the 
five Gauradesas. 
The most important place of pilgrimage in southern India, or Dravi�a, is 
V enkatacala, commonly known as Balaji. After visiting this place Lord 
Balarama proceeded toward Vi§�ukafici, and from there He proceeded on 
the bank of the Kaveri. He took His bath in the River Kaveri; then He 
gradually reached Rangak§etra. The biggest temple in the world is in 
Rangak�etra, and the Vi�!lu deity there is celebrated as Ranganatha. A 
similar temple of Ranganatha is in V rndavana, although it is not as big as 
the temple in Rangak�etra. 
· 
While going to Vi§!lukafici, Lord Balarama also visited Sivakafici. After 
visiting Rangak§etra, He gradually proceeded toward Mathura, commonly 
known as the Mathura of southern India. After visiting this place, He 
gradually proceeded toward Setubandha. Setubandha is the place where 
Lord Ramacandra constructed the stone bridge from India to Lanka 
(Ceylon). In this particularly holy place, Lord Balarama distributed ten 
thousand cows to the local bnihmarw priests. It is the Vedic custom that 
when a rich visitor goes to any place of pilgrimage he gives in charity to 
the local priests gifts of horses, cows, ornaments and garments. This system 
of visiting places of pilgrimage and providing the local briihma[La priests 
with all necessities of life has greatly deteriorated in this age of Kali. The 
richer section of the population, because of its degradation in Vedic 
culture, is no longer attracted by these places of pilgrimage, and the 
briihma[La priests who depended on such visitors have also deteriorated in 
their professional duty of helping the visitors. These briihma[La priests in 
the places of pilgrimage are called pa[Lf}a or pa[Lf}it. This means that they 
formerly were very learned briihma[LaS and used to guide the visitors in all 
details·of the purpose of coming there, and thus both the visitors and the 
priests were benefitted by mutual cooperation. 
It is clear from the description of Srimad-Bhiigavatam that when Lord 
Balarama was visiting the different places of pilgrimage, He properly 
followed the Vedic system. Mter distributing cows at Setubandha, Lord 
Balarama proceeded toward the Krtamala and Tamrapar!li Rivers. These 
two rivers are celebrated as sacred, and Lord Balarama bathed in both. He 
then proceeded toward Malaya Hill. This Malaya Hill is very great, and it is 
said that it is one of seven peaks called the Malaya Hills. The great sage
Agastya used to live there, and Lord Balarama ·visited him and offered His
respects by bowing down before him. After taking the sage's blessings, 
Lord Balarama, with the sage's permission, proceeded toward the Indian 
Ocean. 
Lord Balarama's Touring the Sacred Places 
171 
At the point of the cape there is a big temple of the goddess Durga 
where she is known as Kanyakumari. This temple of Kanyakumari was 
also visited by Lord Ramacandra, and therefore it is to be understood 
that the temple has been existing for millions of years. From there, Lord 
Balarama went on to visit the pilgrimage city known as Phalgunatirtha, 
which is on the shore of the Indian Ocean, or the Southern Ocean. 
Phalgunatirtha is celebrated because Lord Vi§�U in His incarnation of 
Ananta is lying there. From Phalgunatirtha, Lord Balarama went on to 
visit another pilgrimage spot known as Paficapsarasa. There also He bathed 
according to the regulative principles and observed the ritualistic cere­
monies. This site is also celebrated as a shrine of Lord Vi§�U; therefore 
Lord Balarama distributed ten thousand cows to the local bruhmal}a priests. 
From Cape Comarin Lord Balarama turned toward Kerala. The country 
of Kerala is still existing in southern India under the name of South Kerala. 
After visiting this place, He came to Gokar�atirtha, where Lord Siva is 
constantly worshiped. Balarama then visited the temple of Aryadevi, 
which is completely surrounded by water. From that island, He went on to 
a place known as Siirparaka. After this He bathed in the rivers known as 
Tapi, Payo§�i, and Nirvindhya, and He came to the forest known as 
Da��akara�ya. This is the same Dat�-�akarat�-ya Forest where Lord Rama­
candra lived while He was in exile. Lord Balarama next came to the bank 
of the River Narmada, the biggest river in central India. On the bank of 
this sacred Narmada there is a pilgrimage spot known as Mahi§mati Puri. 
After bathing there, according to regulative principles, Lord Balarama 
returned to Prabhasatirtha, wherefrom He had begun His journey. 
When Lord Balarama returned to Prabhasatirtha He heard from the 
brahmal}as that most of the k§atriyas in the Battle of Kuruk§etra had been 
killed. Balarama felt relieved to hear that the burden of the world had been 
reduced. Lord Kf§t�-a and Balarama appeared on this earth to lessen the 
burden of military strength created by the ambitious k§atriya kings. This 
is the way of materialistic life: not being satisfied by the absolute 
necessities of lif�, people ambitiously create extra demands, and their 
illegal desires are checked by the laws of nature or by laws of God, 
appearing as famine, war, pestilence and similar catastrophes. Lord Balarama 
heard that although most of the k§atriyas had been killed, the Kurus were 
still engaged in fighting. Therefore He returned to the battlefield just 
on the day Bhimasena and Duryodhana were engaged in a personal duel 
As well-wisher of both of them, Lord Balarama wanted to stop them, but 
they would not stop. 
When Lord Balarama appeared on the scene, King Yudhi§thira and his 
young brothers, N akula, Sahadeva, Lord Kr§�a and Aijuna, immediately 
172 
Kr��a, the Supreme Personality of Godhead 
offered Him their respectful obeisances, but they did not speak at all. The 
reason they were silent was that Lord Balarama was somewhat affectionate 
toward Duryodhana, and Duryodhana had learned from Balaramaji the art 
of fighting with a club. Thus, when the fighting was going on, King 
YudhiHhira and others thought that Balarama might come there to say 
something in favor of Duryodhana, and they therefore remained silent. 
Both Duryodhana and Bhimasena were very enthusiastic in fighting with 
clubs, and in the midst of large audiences, each was very skillfully trying 
to strike the other, and while attempting to do so they appeared to be 
dancing. But although they appeared to be dancing, it was clear that both 
of them were very angry. 
Lord Balarama, wanting to stop the fighting, said, "My dear King 
Duryodhana and Bhimasena, 1 know that both of you are great fighters 
and are well known in the world as great heroes, but still I think that 
Bhimasena is superior to Duryodhana in bodily strength. On the other 
hand, Duryodhana is superior in the art of fighting with a club. Taking this 
into consideration, My opinion is that neither of you is inferior to the 
other in fighting. Under the circumstances, there is very little chance of 
one of you being defeated by the other. Therefore I request you not to 
waste your time in fighting in this way. I wish you to stop this unnecessary 
fight." 
The good instruction given by Lord Balarama to both Bhimasena and 
Duryodhana was intended for the equal benefit of both of them. But they 
were so enwrapped in anger against each other that they could only 
remember their long-lasting personal enmity. Each thought only of killing 
the other, and they did not give much importance to the instruction of 
Lord Balarama. Both of them then became like madmen in remembering 
the strong accusations and ill behavior they had exchanged with one 
another. Lord Balarama, being able to understand the destiny which was 
awaiting them, was not eager to go further in the matter. Therefore, instead 
of staying, He decided to return to the city of Dvaraka. 
When He returned to Dvaraka, He was received with great jubilation by 
relatives and friends, headed by King Ugrasena and other elderly persons; 
all of them came forward to welcome Lord Balarama. After this, He again 
went to the holy place of pilgrimage at Naimi�ara�ya, and the sages, 
saintly persons and briihmaras all received Him standing. They understood 
that Lord Balarama, although a k§atriya, was now retired from the fighting 
business. The briihmanas and the sages, who were always for peace and 
tranquility, were very pleased at this. All of them embraced Balarama with 
great affection and induced Him to perform various kinds of sacrifices in 
Lord Balarama's Touring the Sacred Places 
173 
that sacred spot of N aimi§iira�ya. Actually Lord Balarama had no business 
performing the sacrifices recommended for ordinary human beings; He is 
the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and therefore He Himself is the 
enjoyer of all such sacrifices. As such, His exemplary action in performing 
sacrifices was only to give a lesson to the common man to show how one 
should abide by the injunction of the Vedas. 
The Supreme Personality of Godhead Balarama instructed the sages and 
saintly persons at Naimi§iiranya on the subject matter of the living entities' 
relationship with this cosmic manifestation, on how one should accept this 
whole universe and on how one should relate with the cosmos in order to 
achieve the highest goal of perfection, the understanding that the whole 
cosmic manifestation is resting on the Supreme Personality of Godhead 
and that the Supreme Personality of Godhead is also all-pervading, even 
within the minutest atom, by the function of His Paramatma feature. 
Lord Balarama then took the avabhrtha bath which is accepted after 
finishing sacrificial performances. After taking His bath, He dressed Himself 
in new silken garments and decorated Himself with beautiful jewelry 
amidst His relatives and friends. He appeared to be a shining full moon 
amidst the luminaries in the sky. Lord Balarama is the Personality of 
Godhead Ananta Himself; therefore He is beyond the scope of under­
standing by mind, intelligence or body. He descended exactly like a human 
being and behaved in that way for His own purpose; we can only explain 
His activities as the Lord's pastimes. No one can even estimate the extent 
of the unlimited demonstrations of His pastimes because He is all­
powerful. Lord Balarama is the original Vi§�U; therefore anyone remem­
bering these pastimes of Lord Balarama in the morning and evening, will 
certainly become a great devotee of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, 
and thus his life will become successful in all respects. 
Thus ends the Bhaktivedanta purport of the Second Volume, Twenty­
fourth Chapter, of Krwa, "The Liberation of Balvala, and Lord Balariima 's 
Touring Sacred Places." 
25 I Meeting of Lord Kr��a 
with Sudama Brahmana 
• 
King Parik�it was hearing the narrations of the pastimes of Lord Kr�!la 
and Lord Balarama from Sukadeva Gosvami These pastimes are all tran­
scendentally pleasurable to hear, and Maharaja Parik�it addressed Sukadeva 
Gosvami as follows: "My dear Lord, the Supreme Personality of Godhead 
Kr�!la is the bestower of both liberation and love ofGod simultaneously. 
Anyone who becomes a devotee of the Lord automatically attains libera­
tion without having to make a separate attempt. The Lord is unlimited, 
and as such, His pastimes and activities for creating, maintaining and 
destroying the whole cosmic manifestation are unlimited. I therefore wish 
to hear about His other pastimes of which you may not have spoken as 
yet. My dear master, the conditioned souls within this material world have 
been frustrated by searching out the pleasure of happiness derived from 
sense gratification. Such desires for material enjoyment are always piercing 
the heart of conditioned souls. But I am actually experiencing how the 
transcendental topics of Lord Kr�!la's pastimes can relieve one from the 
state of being affected by such sense gratificatory material activities. I 
think that no intelligent person can reject this method of hearing the 
transcendental pastimes of the Lord again and again; simply by hearing, 
one can remain always steeped in transcendental pleasure. Thus one will 
not be attracted by material sense gratification." 
In this statement, Maharaja Parik�it has used two important words: 
vi§arz-rw� and vise§ajiia�: vi§arz,rz,a� means "morose." The materialistic 
persons are inventing many ways and means to become fully satisfied, but 
actually they remain morose. The point may be raised that sometimes 
those who are transcendentalists also remain morose. Parik�it Maharaja has 
used, however, the word vise§ajiia�. There are two kinds of transcenden­
talists, namely the impersonalists and the personalists. Vise§ajiia� refers to 
the personalists, who are interested in transcendental variegatedness. The 
174 
Meeting of Lord Kr��a with Sudama Brahma�a 
175 
devotees become jubilant by hearing the descriptions of the personal 
activities of the Supreme Lord, whereas the impersonalists, who are ac­
tually more attracted by the impersonal feature of the Lord, are only 
superficially attracted by the personal activities of the Lord. As such, in 
spite of coming in contact with the pastimes of the Lord, the imperson­
alists do not fully realize the benefit to be derived, and thus they remain 
in exactly the same morose position, due to fruitive activity, with the 
materialists. 
King Parik�it continued: "The capacity for talking can be perfected only 
by describing the transcendental qualities of the Lord. The capacity for 
working with one's hands can be successful only when one engages him'self 
in the service of the Lord with those hands. Similarly, one's mind can be 
pacified only when he simply thinks of Kr�tta in full KHtta consciousness. 
This does not mean that one has to be very thoughtful, but one simply has 
to understand that Kr�tta, the Absolute Truth, is all-pervasive, by His 
localized aspect as Paramatma. If only one can think that Kr§tta, as 
Paramatma, is everywhere, even within the atom, then one can perfect the 
thinking, feeling and willing function of his mind. The perfect devotee does 
not see the material world as it appears to material eyes, but he sees 
everywhere the presence of his worshipable Lord in His Paramatma 
feature." 
Maharaja Parik§it continued to say that the function of the ear can be 
perfected simply by engagement in hearing the transcendental activities of 
the Lord. He said further that the function of the head can be fully 
utilized when the head is engaged in bowing down before the Lord and 
His representative. That the Lord is represented in everyone's heart is a 
fact, and therefore the highly advanced devotee offers his respects to 
every living entity, considering that the body is the temple of the Lord. 
But it is not possible for all men to come to that stage of life immediately, 
because that stage is for the first-class devotee. The second-class devotee 
can consider the V ai§ttavas, or the devotees of the Lord, to be representa­
tives of Kr�tta, and the devotee who is just beginning, the neophyte or 
third-class devotee, can bow his head before the Deity in the temple and 
before the spiritual master, who is the direct manifestation of the Suprem� 
Personality of Godhead. In the neophyte stage, in the intermediate stage, 
or in the fully advanced perfected stage, one can make the function of the 
head perfect by bowing down before the Lord or His representative. 
Similarly, he can perfect the function of the eyes by seeing the Lord and 
His representative. In this way, everyone can elevate the functions of the 
different parts of his body to the highest perfectional stage simply by 
176 
Kr�tJ.a, the Supreme Personality of Godhead 
engaging them in the service of the Lord or His representative. If one is 
able to do nothing more, he can simply bow down before the Lord and 
His representative and drink the carar-amrta, the water which has washed 
the lotus feet of the Lord or His devotee. 
On hearing these statements of Maharaja PanK.�it, Sukadeva Gosvami 
became overwhelmed with devotional ecstasy because of King Parik�it's 
advanced understanding of the V ai��ava philosophy. Sukadeva Gosvami 
was already engaged in describing the activities of the Lord, and when he 
was asked by Maharaja Parik�it to describe them further, he continued 
with great pleasure to narrate Srimad-Bhiigavatam. 
There was a very nice briihmarw friend of Lord Kr�tJ.a. As a perfect 
briihmar-a, he was very elevated in transcendental knowledge, and because 
of his advanced knowledge, he was not at all attached to material enjoy­
ment. Therefore he was very peaceful and had achieved supreme control 
over his senses. This means that the briihmar-a was a perfect devotee 
because unless one is a perfect devotee, he cannot achieve the highest 
standard of knowledge. It is stated in the Bhagavad-gftii that a person who 
has come to the point of perfection of knowledge surrenders unto the 
Supreme Personality of Godhead. In other words, any person who has 
surrendered his life for the service of the Supreme Personality of Godhead 
has come to the point of perfect knowledge. The result of perfect know­
ledge is that one becomes detached from the materialistic way of life. 
This detachment means complete control of the senses, which are always 
attracted by material enjoyment. The senses of the devotee become 
purified, and in that stage the senses are engaged in the service of the 
Lord. That is the complete field of devotional service. 
Although the briihmar-a friend of Lord Kr��a was a householder, he was 
not busy accumulating wealth for very comfortable living; therefore he 
was satisfied by the income which automatically came to him according to 
his destiny. This is the sign of perfect knowledge. A man who is in perfect 
knowledge knows that one cannot be happier than he is destined to be. In 
this material world, everyone is destined to suffer a certain amount of 
distress and to enjoy a certain amount of happiness. The amount of happi­
ness and distress is already predestined for every living entity. No one can 
increase or decrease the happiness of the materialistic way of life. The 
briihmar;w, therefore, did not exert himself for more material happiness, 
but he used his time for advancement of Kr�t�a consciousness. Externally 
he appeared to be very poor because he had no rich dress and could not 
provide a very rich dress for his wife, and because their material condition 
was not very opulent they were not even eating sufficiently, and thus both 
Meeting of Lord Kr��a with Sudama Brahma�a 
177 
he and his wife appeared to be very thin. The wife was not very anxious 
for her personal comfort, put she felt very concerned for her husband, 
who was such a pious briihmar;ta. She was trembling due to her weak 
health, and although she did not like to dictate to her husband, she spoke 
as follows: 
"My dear lord, I know that Lord Kr��a, who is the husband of the 
goddess of fortune, is your personal friend. You are also a devotee of Lord 
Kr��a, and He is always ready to help His devotee. Even if you think that 
you are not rendering any devotional service to the Lord, still you are 
surrendered to Him, and the Lord is the protector of the surrendered soul. 
Moreover, I know that Lord Kr�tla is the ideal personality of Vedic culture. 
He is always in favor of brahminical culture and is very kind to the quali­
fied briihmar;tas. You are the most fortunate person because you have as 
your friend the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Lord Kr�tla is the only 
shelter for personalities like you because you are fully surrendered unto 
Him. You are saintly, learned and fully in control of your senses. Under 
the circumstances, Lord Krwa is your only shelter. Please, therefore, go to 
Him. I am sure that He will immediately understand your impoverished 
position. You are also a householder; therefore without any money you 
are in a distressed condition. But as soon as He understands your position, 
He will certainly give you sufficient riches so that you can live very com­
fortably. Lord Kr�tla is now the King of the Bhoja, Vr�tJ.i and Andhaka 
dynasties, and I have heard that He never leaves His capital city, Dvaraka. 
He is living there. without outside engagements. He is so kind and liberal 
that He immediately gives everything, even His personal self, to any person 
who surrenders unto Him. When He is prepared to give Himself personally 
to His devotee, then there is nothing wonderful in giving some material 
riches. Of course, He does not give much material wealth to His devotee if 
the devotee is not very fixed, but I think in your case He knows perfectly 
well how much you are fixed in devotional service. Therefore He will not 
hesitate to award you some material benefit for the bare necessities of 
life." 
In this way, the wife of the briihmar;ta again and again requested, in 
great humility and submission, that he go to Lord Kr�tJ.a. The briihmapa 
thought that there was no need to ask any material benefit from Lord Sri
Kr��a, but he was induced by the repeated requests of his wife. Moreover, 
he thought, "If I go there I shall be able to see the Lord personally. That 
will be a great opportunity, even if I don't ask any material benefit from 
Him." When he had decided to go to Kr��a, he asked his wife if she had 
anything in the home that he could offer to Kr�tJ.a, because he must take 
178 
Kr��}l, the Supreme Personality of Godhead 
some presentation for his friend. The wife immediately collected four 
palmsful of chipped rice from her neighboring friends and tied it in a 
small cloth, like a handkerchief, and gave it to her husband to present to 
Kr��a. Without waiting any longer, the briihmarw took the presentation 
and began to proceed toward Dvaraka to see his Lord. While he was pro­
ceeding toward Dvaraka he was absorbed in the thought of how he could 
be able to see Lord Kr�!la. He had no thought within his heart other than 
Krwa. 
It was of course very difficult to reach the palaces of the kings of the 
Y adu dynasty, but briihmaf!-as were allowed to visit, and when the briih­
maf!-a friend of Lord Kr�l).a went there, he,. along with other briihmaf!-as, 
had to pass through three military encampments. In each camp there were 
very big gates, and he also had to pass through them. After the gates and 
the camps, there were sixteen thousand big palaces, the residential quar­
ters of the sixteen thousand queens of Lord Kf�l).a. The briihmaf!-a entered 
one palace which was very gorgeously decorated. When he entered this 
beautiful palace, he felt that he was swimming in the ocean of transcen­
dental pleasure. �e felt himself constantly diving and surfacing in that 
transcendental ocean. 
At that time, Lord Kr�!la was sitting on the bedstead of Queen Rukmil).i. 
Even from a considerable distance He could see the briihmara coming to 
His home, and He could recognize him as His friend. Lord Kr��a immedi­
ately left His seat and came forward to receive His briihmara friend and, 
upon reaching him, embraced the briihmara with His two arms. Lord Kr�!la 
is the reservoir of all transcendental pleasure, and yet He Himself felt 
great pleasure upon embracing the poor briihmaf!-a because He was meeting 
His very dear friend. Lord Kr�!la had him seated on His own bedstead and 
personally brought him all kinds of fruits and drinks to offer him, as is 
proper in receiving a worshipable guest. Lord Sri Kr�!la is the supreme 
pure, but because He was playing the role of an ordinary human being, He 
immediately washed the briihmara's feet and, for His own purification, 
sprinkled the water onto His head. After this the Lord smeared the body 
of the briihmara with different kinds of scented pulp, such as sandalwood, 
aguru and saffron. He immediately burned several kinds of scented incense, 
and, as is usual, He offered him iiriitrika with burning lamps. After thus 
offering him an adequate welcome and after the briihmara had taken food 
and drink, Lord Kf�l).a said, "My dear friend, it is a great fortune that you 
have come here." 
The briihmara, being very poor, was not dressed nicely; his clothing was 
torn and dirty, and his body was also very lean and thin. He appeared not 
Meeting of Lord Kr��a with Sudama Brahma�a 
179 
to be very clean, and because of his weak body, his bones were distinctly 
visible. The goddess of fortune Rukmi�idevi personally began to fan him 
with the ciimara fan, but the other women in the palace became astonished 
at Lord Kr��a's behavior in receiving the briihmara in that way. They were 
surprised to see how eager Lord Kr§�a was to welcome this particular 
briihmara. They began to wonder how Lord Kr��a could personally re­
ceive a briihmara who was poor, not very neat or clean, and poorly dressed; 
but at the same time they could realize that the briihmar.a was not an 
ordinary living being. They knew that he must have performed great pious 
activities; otherwise why was Lord Kr��a, the husband of the goddess of 
fortune, taking so much care for him? They were still more surprised to see 
that the briihmara was seated on the bedstead of Lord Kr��a. They were 
especially surprised to see that Lord Kr��a had embraced him exactly as 
He embraced His elder brother, Balaramaji, because Lord Kr��a used to 
embrace only Rukmi�i or Balarama, and no one else. 
After receiving the briihma!)a nicely, and seating him on His own cush­
ioned bed, Lord Kr��a said, "My dear briihmara friend, you are a most 
intelligent personality, and you know very well the principles of religious 
life. I believe that after you finished your education at the house of our 
teacher and after you sufficiently remunerated him, you must have gone 
back to your home and accepted a suitable wife. I know very well that 
from the beginning you were not at all attached to the materialistic way 
of life, nor did you desire to be very opulent materially, and therefore you 
are in need of money. In this material world, persons who are not attached 
to material opulence are very rarely found. Such unattached persons 
haven't the least desire to accumulate wealth and prosperity for sense 
gratification, but sometimes they are found to collect money just to 
exhibit the exemplary life of a householder. They show how by proper 
distribution of wealth one can become an ideal householder and at the same 
time become a great devotee. Such ideal householders are to be considered 
followers of My footsteps. I hope, My dear briihmara friend, you remember 
all those days of our school life when both you and I were living together 
at the boarding house. Actually, whatever knowledge both you and I re­
ceived in our life was accumulated in our student life. 
"If a man is sufficiently educated in student life under the guidance of a 
proper teacher, then his life becomes successful in the future. He can very 
easily cross over the ocean of nescience, and he is not subjected to the 
influence of illusory energy. My dear friend, everyone should consider his 
father to be his first teacher because by the mercy of one's father one gets 
this body. The father is therefore the natural spiritual master. Our next 
180 
Kr��a, the Supreme Personality of Godhead 
spiritual master is he who initiates us into transcendental knowledge, and 
he is to be worshiped as much as I am. The spiritual master may be more· 
than one. The spiritual master who instructs the disciples about spiritual 
matters is called sik§a-guru, and the spiritual master who initiates the 
disciple is called diksii-guru. Both of them are My representatives. There 
may be many spiritual masters who instruct, but the initiator spiritual 
master is one. A human being who takes advantage of these spiritual 
masters and, receiving proper knowledge from them, crosses the ocean of 
material existence, is to be understood as having properly utilized his 
human form of life. He has practical knowledge that the ultimate interest 
of life, which is to be gained only in this human form, is to achieve spiritual 
perfection and thus be transferred back home, back to Godhead. 
"My dear friend, I am Paramatma, the Supersoul present in everyone's 
heart, and it is My direct order that human society must follow the prin­
ciples of varrz.a and iisrama. As I have stated in the Bhagavad-gitii, the 
human society should be divided, according to quality and action, into 
four varrz.as. Similarly, everyone should divide his life into four pa�;ts. One 
should utilize the first part of life iri becoming a bona fide student, 
receiving adequate knowledge and keeping oneself in the vow of brahma­
carya, so that one may completely devote his life for the service of the 
spiritual master without indulging in sense gratification. A brahmaciiri 
is meant to lead a life of austerities and penance. The householder is 
meant to live a regulated life of sense gratification, but no one should 
remain a householder for the third stage of life. In that stage, one has to 
return to the austerities and penances formerly practiced in b rahmaciiri 
life and thus relieve himself of the attachment to household life. Mter 
being relieved of his attachments to the materialistic way of life, one may 
accept the order of sannyiisa. 
"As the Supersoul of the living entities, sitting in everyone's heart, I
observe everyone's activity in every stage and order of life. Regardless of 
which stage one is in, when I see that one is engaged seriously and sincerely 
in discharging the duties ordered by the spiritual master, and is thus 
dedicating his life to the service of the spiritual master, that person be­
comes most dear to Me. As far as the life of brahmacarya is concerned, if 
one can continue the life of a brahmaciiri under the direction of a spiritual 
master, that is extremely good; but if in brahmaciiri life one feels sex 
impulses, then he should take leave of his spiritual master, satisfying him 
according to the guru's desire. According to the Vedic system, a gift is 
offered to the spiritual master, which is called guru-dak§irz.ii. Then the 
disciple should take to householder life and accept a wife according to 
religious rites." 
Meeting of Lord Kr��a with Sudama Brahma�a 
181 
These instructions given by Lord Kr§v.a while talking with His friend 
the learned briihmara are very good for the guidance of human society. A 
system of human civilization that does not promote varra and iisrama is 
nothing but polished animal society. Indulgence in sex life by a man or 
woman living single is never acceptable in human society. A man should 
either strictly follow the principles of brahmaciiri life or, with the permis­
sion of the spiritual master, should get married. Single life with illicit sex 
is animal life. For the animals there is no marriage institution. 
Modern society does not aim at fulfilling the mission of human life. The 
mission of human life is to go back home, back to Godhead. To fulfill 
this mission, the system of varra and iisrama must be followed. When the 
system is followed rigidly and consciously, it fulfills this mission of life. 
When it is followed indirectly, without guidance of superior order, then it 
simply creates a disturbing condition in human society, and there is no 
peace and prosperity. 
Kr§v.a continued to talk with His briihmara friend: "My dear friend, I 
think you remember our activities during the days when we were living as 
students. You may remember that once we went to collect fuel from-the 
forest on the order of the guru's wife. While we were collecting the dried 
wood, we by chance entered the dense forest and became lost. There was 
an unexpected dust storm and then clouds and lightning in the sky and the 
explosive sound of thunder. Then sunset came, and we were lost in the 
dark jungle. After this, there was severe rainfall; the whole ground was 
overflooded with water, and we could not trace out the way to return to 
our guru's iisrama. You may remember that heavy rainfall-it was not 
actually rainfall but a sort of devastation. On account of the dust storm 
and the heavy rain, we began to feel greatly pained, and in whichever 
direction we turned we were bewildered. In that distressed condition, we 
took each other's hand and tried to find our way out. We passed the whole 
night in that way, and early in the morning when our absence became 
known to our gurudeva, he sent his other disciples to search us out. He also 
came with them, and when they reached us in the jungle they found us to 
be very distressed. 
"With· great compassion our gurudeva said, 'My dear boys, it is very 
wonderful that you have suffered so much trouble for me. Everyone likes 
to take care of his body as the first consideration, but you are so good and 
faithful to your guru that without caring for bodily comforts you have 
taken so much trouble for me. I am also glad to see that bona fide students 
like you will undergo any kind of trouble for the satisfaction of the 
spiritual master. That is the way for a bona fide disciple to become free 
Kr��a, the Supreme Personality of Godhead 
from his debt to the spiritual master. It is the duty of the disciple to dedi­
cate his life to the service of the spiritual master. My dear best of the 
twice-born, I am greatly pleased by your action, and I bless you: May all 
your desires and ambitions be fulfilled. May the understanding of the 
Vedas which you have learned from me always continue to remain within 
your memory, so that at every moment you can remember the teachings of 
the 
Vedas and quote their instructions without difficulty. Thus you 
will never be disappointed in this life or in the next.'" 
Kr��a continued: "My dear friend, you may remember that many such 
incidents occurred while we were in the iisrama of our spiritual master. 
Both of us can realize that without the blessings of the spiritual master no 
one can be happy. By the mercy of the spiritual master and by his blessings, 
one can achieve peace and prosperity and be able to fulfill the mission of 
human life." 
On hearing this, the learned briihmarza replied, "My dear Kr��a, You are 
the Supreme Lord and the supreme spiritual master of everyone, and since 
I was fortunate enough to live with You in the house of our guru, I think 
I have nothing more to do in the matter of prescribed Vedic duties. My 
dear Lord, the Vedic hymns, ritualistic ceremonies, religious activities, and 
all other necessities for the perfection of human life, including economic 
development, sense gratification and liberation, are all derived from one 
source: Your supreme personality. AU the different processes of life are 
ultimately meant for the understanding of Your personality. In other 
words, they are the different parts of Your transcendental form. And yet 
You played the role of a student and lived with us in the house of the guru. 
This means that You adopted all these pastimes for Your pleasure only; 
otherwise there was no need for Your playing the role of a human being." 
"Thus ends the Bhaktivedanta purport of the Second Volume, Twenty­
fifth Chapter, of Kr��a, "Meeting of Lord Knrza with Sudiimii Briihmarza., 
26 I The Brahmana Sudama 
• 
Benedicted by Lord Kr��a 
Lord Kr�!la, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, the Supersoul of all 
living entities, knows very well everyone's heart. He is especially inclined 
to the briihmm;w devotees. Lord Kr�!la is also called brahmal)yadeva, which 
means that He is worshiped by the briihmal)aS. Therefore it is understood 
that a devotee who is fully surrendered unto the Supreme Personality of 
Godhead has already acquired the position of a briihmal)a. Without be­
coming a briihmal)a, one cannot approach the Supreme Brahman, Lord 
Kr�!la. Kr�!la is especially concerned with vanquishing the distress of His 
devotees, and He is the only shelter of pure devotees. 
Lord Kr�!la was engaged for a long time in talking with Sudama Vipra 
about their past association. Then, just to enjoy the company of an old 
friend, Lord Kr�!la began to smile, and asked, "My dear friend, what have 
you brought for Me? Has your wife given you some nice eatable for Me?" 
While He. was addressing His friend, Lord Kr�!la was looking upon him and 
smiling with great love. He continued: "My dear friend, you must have 
brought some presentation for Me from your home." 
Lord Kr�!la knew that Sudama was hesitating to present Him the paltry 
chipped rice which was actually unfit for His eating, and understanding 
the mind of Sudarna Vipra the Lord said, "My dear friend, certainly I am 
not in need of anything, but if My devotee gives Me something as an offer­
ing of love, even though it may be very insignificant, I accept it with great 
pleasure. On the other hand, if a person is not a devotee, even though he 
may offer Me very valuable things, I do not like to accept them. I actually 
accept only things which are offered to Me in devotion and love; other­
wise, however valuable the thing rnay be, I do not accept it. If My pure devo­
tee offers Me even the most insignificant things-a little flower, a little piece 
of leaf, a little water-but saturates the offering in devotional love, then 
I not only gladly accept such an offering, but I eat it with great pleasure." 
183 
184 
Kr��a, the Supreme Personality of Godhead 
Lord Kr��a assured Sudama Vipra that He would be very glad to accept 
the chipped rice which he had brought from home, yet out of great 
shyness, Sudama Vipra hesitated to present it to the Lord. He was 
thinking, "How can I offer such insignificant things to Kr��a?" and he 
simply bowed his head. 
Lord Krwa, the Supersoul, knows everything in everyone's heart. He 
knows everyone's determination and everyone's want. He knew, there­
fore, the reason for Sudama Vipra's coming to Him. He knew that, driven 
by extreme poverty, he had come there at the request of his wife. Thinking 
of Sudama as His very dear class friend, He knew that Sudama's love for 
Him as a friend was never tainted by any desire for material benefit. Kr§�a 
thought, "Sudama has not come asking anything from Me, but being 
obliged by the request of his wife, he has come to see Me just to please 
her." Lord Kr§�a therefore decided that He would give more material 
opulence to Sudama Vipra than could be imagined even by the King of 
heaven. 
He then snatched the bundel of chipped rice which was hanging on the 
shoulder of the poor briihmar;w, packed in one corner of his wrapper, and 
said, "What is this? My dear friend, you have brought Me nice, palatable 
chipped rice!" He encouraged Sudama Vipra, saying, "I consider that this 
quantity of chipped rice will not only satisfy Me, but will satisfy the 
whole creation." It is understood from this statement that Kr§�a, being 
the original source of everything, is the root of the entire creation. As 
watering the root of a tree immediately distributes water to every part of 
the tree, so an offering made to Kf§�a, or any action done for Krwa, is to 
be considered the highest welfare work for everyone, because the benefit of 
such an offering is distributed throughout the creation. Love for Kr§�a 
becomes distributed to all living entities. 
While 'Lord Kr§�a was speaking to Sudama Vipra, He ate one morsel of 
chipped rice from his bundle, and when He attempted to eat a second 
morsel, Rukmi�idevi, who is the goddess of fortune herself, checked the 
Lord by catching hold of His hand. After touching the hand of Krwa, 
Rukmi�i said, "My dear Lord, this one morsel of chipped rice is sufficient 
to cause him who offered it to become very opulent in this life and to 
continue his opulence in the next life. My Lord, You are so kind to Your 
devotee that even this one morsel of chipped rice pleases You very greatly, 
and Your pleasure assures the devotee opulence both in this life and in the 
next." This indicates that when food is offered to Lord Kr��a with love 
and devotion and He is pleased and accepts it from the devotee, Rukmi�i­
devi, the goddess of fortune, becomes so greatly obliged to the devotee 
The Brahma!la Sudama Benedicted by Lord Kr�!la 
185 
that she has to personally go to the devotee's home to turn it into the 
most opulent home in the world. If one feeds Naraya�a sumptuously, the 
goddess of fortune, Lak�mi', automatically becomes a guest in one's house, 
which means that one's home becomes opulent. The learned briihmara 
Sudama passed that night at the house of Lord Kr��a, and while he was 
there he felt as if he were living in the V aiku�tha planet. Actually he was 
living in V aiku�tha, because wherever Lord Kr��a, the original Naraya�a, 
and Rukmi!li'devi', the goddess of fortune, live is not different from the 
spiritual planet, V aiku!lthaloka. 
The learned briihmara Sudama did not appear to have received anything 
substantial from Lord Kr��a while he was at His place, and yet he did not 
ask anything from the Lord. The next morning he started for his home, 
thinking always about his reception by Kr��a, and thus he became merged 
in transcendental bliss. All the way home he was simply remembering the 
dealings of Lord Kr��a, and he was feeling very happy to have seen the 
Lord. 
The briihmara began to think as follows: "It is most pleasurable to see 
Lord Kr��a, who is most devoted to the briihmaras. How great a lover He
is of the brahminical culture! He is the Supreme Brahman Himself, yet He 
reciprocates with the briihmaras. He also respects the briihmaras so much 
that He embraced to His chest a poor briihmara like me, although He never 
embraces anyone to His chest except the goddess of fortune. How can 
there be any comparison between me, a poor, sinful briihmara, and the 
Supreme Lord Krwa, who is the only shelter of the goddess of fortune? 
And yet, considering me as a briihmara, He embraced me with heartfelt 
pleasure in His two transcendental arms. Lord Kr��a was so kind to me 
that He allowed me to sit down on the same bedstead where the goddess of 
fortune lies down. He considered me to be His real brother. How can I 
appreciate my obligation to Him? When I was tired, Sri'mati' Rukmi�i'devi', 
the goddess of fortune, began to fan me, holding the ciimara whisk in her· 
own hand. She never considered her exalted position as the first queen of 
Lord Kr��a. I was rendered service by the Supreme Personality of Godhead 
because of His high regard for the briihmaras, and by massaging my legs 
and feeding me with His own hand, He practically worshiped me! Aspiring 
for elevation to the heavenly planets, or liberation or all kinds of material 
opulences, or perfection in the mystic yoga powers, everyone throughout 
the universe worships the lotus feet of Lord Kr��a. Yet the Lord was so 
kind to me that He did not give me even a farthing, knowing very well that 
I am a poverty-stricken man who, if I got some money, might become 
puffed up and mad after material opulence and so forget Him." 
I.

186 
Kr��a, the Supreme Personality of Godhead 
The statement of the briihmar-a Sudama is correct. An ordinary man 
who is very poor and prays to the Lord for benediction in material opu­
lence, and who somehow or other becomes richer in material opulence, 
immediately forgets his obligation to the Lord. Therefore, the Lord does 
not offer opulences to His devotee unless the devotee is thoroughly desti­
tute. Rather, if a neophyte devotee serves the Lord very sincerely and at the 
same time wants material opulence, the Lord keeps him from obtaining it. 
Thinking in this way, the learned briihmar-a gradually reached his own 
home. But on reaching there he saw that everything was wonderfully 
changed. He saw that in place of his cottage there were big palaces made 
of valuable stones and jewels, glittering like the sun, moon and rays of fire. 
Not only were there big palaces, but at intervals there were beautifully 
decorated parks, in which many beautiful men and women were strolling. 
In those parks there were nice lakes full of lotus flowers and beautiful 
lilies, and there were flocks of multicolored birds. Seeing the wonderful 
conversion of his native place, the briihmar-a began to think to himself, 
"How am I seeing all these changes? Does this place belong to me, or to 
someone else? If it is the same place where I used to live, then how has it 
so wonderfully changed?" 
While the learned briihmar-a was considering this, a group of beautiful 
men and women with features resembling those of the demigods, accom­
panied by musical chanters, approached to welcome him. All were singing 
auspicious songs. The wife of the briihmar-a became very glad on hearing 
the tidings of her husband's arrival, and with great haste she also came out 
of the palace. The briihmar-a's wife appeared s� beautiful that it seemed 
as if the goddess of fortune herself had come to receive him. As soon as 
she saw her husband present before her, tears of joy began to fall from 
her eyes, and her voice became so choked up that she could not even 
address her husband. She simply closed her eyes in ecstasy. But with 
great love and affection she bowed down before her husband, and 
within herself she thought of embracing him. She was fully decorated 
with a gold necklace and ornaments, and while standing among the 
maidservants she appeared like the wife of a demigod just alighting 
from an airplane. The briihmar-a was surprised to see his wife so beautiful, 
and in great affection and without saying a word he entered the palace 
with his wife. 
When the briihmar-a entered his personal apartment in the palace, he saw 
that it was not an apartment, but the residence of the King of heaven. The 
palace was surrounded by many columns of jewels. The couches and the 
bedsteads were made of ivory, bedecked with gold and jewels, and the 
The Brahma!la Sudama Benedicted by Lord Kr�!la 
187 
bedding was as white as the foam of milk and as soft as a lotus flower. 
There were many whisks hanging from golden rods, and many golden 
thrones with sitting cushions as soft as the lotus flower. In various places 
there were velvet and silken canopies with laces of pearls hanging all 
around. The structure of the building was standing on first-class transparent 
marble, with engravings made of emerald stones. All the women in the 
palace were carrying lamps made of valuable jewels. The flames and the 
jewels combined to produce a wonderfully brilliant light. When the 
brahmm:w saw his position suddenly changed to one of opulence, and 
when he could not determine the cause for such a sudden change, he 
began to consider very gravely how it had happened. 
He thus began to think, "From the beginning of my life I have been 
extremely poverty-stricken, so what could be the cause of such great and 
sudden opulence? I do not find any cause other than the all-merciful 
glance of my friend Lord Kr�9-a, the chief of the Yadu dynasty. Certainly 
these are gifts of Lord Kr�!la 's causeless mercy. The Lord is self-sufficient, 
the husband of the goddess of fortune, and thus He is always' full with six 
opulences. He can understand the mind of His devotee, and He sumptuous­
ly fulfills the devotee's desires. All these are acts of my friend, Lord Kr�9-a. 
My beautiful dark friend Kr�!la is far more liberal than the cloud which 
can fill up the great ocean with water. Without disturbing the cultivator 
with rain during the day, the cloud brings liberal rain at night just to 
satisfy him. And yet when the cultivator wakes up in the morning, he 
considers that it has not rained enough. Similarly, the Lord fulfills the 
desire of everyone according' to his position, and yet one who is not in
Kr�!la consciousness considers all the gifts of the Lord to be less than his 
desire. On the other hand, when the Lord receives a little thing in love 
and affection from His devotee, He considers it a great and valuable gift. 
The vivid example is myself. I simply offered Him a morsel of chipped 
rice, and in exchange He has given me opulences greater than the opulence 
of the King of heaven." 
What the devotee actually offers to the Lord is not needed by the Lord. 
He is self-sufficient. If the devotee offers something to the Lord, it acts 
for his own interest because whatever a devotee offers to the Lord comes 
back in a quantity a million times greater than what was offered. One 
does not become a loser by giving to the Lord, but he becomes a gainer by 
millions of times. 
The brahmarw, feeling great obligation to Kr�9-a, thought, "I pray to 
have the friendship of Lord Kr�!la and to engage in His service, and to 
surrender fully unto Him in love and affection, life after life. I do not 
J 
188 
Kr��a, the Supreme Personality of Godhead 
want any opulence. I only desire not to forget His service. I simply 
wish to be associated with His pure devotees. May my mind and ac­
tivities be always engaged in His service. The unborn Supreme Per­
sonality of Godhead Kr��a knows that many great personalities have 
fallen from their positions because of extravagant opulence. There­
fore, even when His devotee asks for some opulence from Him, the 
Lord sometimes does not give it. He is very cautious about His devotees. 
Because a devotee in an immature position of devotional service may, if 
offered great opulence, fall from his position due to being in the material 
world, the Lord does not offer opulence to him. This is another manifesta­
tion of the causeless mercy of the Lord upon His devotee. His first interest 
is that the devotee may not fall. He is exactly like a well-wishing father 
who does not give much wealth into the hand of his immature son, but 
who, when the son is grown up and knows how to spend money, gives 
him the whole treasury house." 
The learned briihmarw thus concluded that whatever opulences he had 
received from the Lord should not be used for his extravaga�t sense 
gratification, but for the service of the Lord. The briihmarw accepted his 
newly-acquired opulence, but he did so in a spirit of renunciation, 
unattached to sense gratification, and thus he lived very peacefully with 
his wife, enjoying all the facilities of opulence as prasiidam of the Lord. 
He enjoyed varieties of foodstuff by offering it to the Lord and then 
taking it as prasiidam. Similarly, if by the grace of the Lord we get such 
opulences as material wealth, fame, power, education and beauty, it is our 
duty to consider t.hat they are all gifts of the Lord and must be used for 
His service, not for our sense enjoyment. The learned briihmarw remained 
in that position, and instead of deteriorating due to great opulence, his 
love and affection for Lord Kr�!la increased day after day. Material 
opulence can be the cause of degradation and also the cause of elevation, 
according to the purposes for which it is used. If opulence is used for 
sense gratification, it is the cause of degradation, and if it is used for the 
service of the Lord, it is the cause of elevation. 
It is evident from Lord Kr�l!a's dealings with Sudama Vipra that the 
Supreme Personality of Godhead is very, very pleased with a person who is 
possessed of brahminical qualities. A qualified briihmm;w like Sudama 
Vipra is naturally a devotee of Lord Kr��a. Therefore it is said, briihmarzo 
vai§rava�: a briihmm;w is a Vai§rava. Or sometimes it is said, briihmana� 
parflita�. Parflita means a highly learned person. A briihmara cannot be 
foolish or uneducated. Therefore there are two divisions of briihmanas, 
. 
. 
namely Vai§ravas and parflitas. Those who are simply learned are par-flits� 
but not yet devotees of the Lord, or Vai§ravas. Lord Kr�!la is not 
The Brahma!la Sudama Benedicted by Lord Kr�!la 
189 
especially pleased with them. Simply the qualification of being a learned 
briihmm;w is not sufficient to attract the Supreme Personality of Godhead. 
A briihmm;w must not only be well qualified according to the requirements 
stated in scriptures such as Srimad Bhagavad-gitii and Srimad-Bhagavatam, 
but at the same time he must be a devotee of Lord Kr�J).a. The vivid 
example is Sudama Vipra. He was a qualified briihmara, unattached to all 
sorts of material sense enjoyment, and at the same time a great devotee of 
Lord Kr�J).a. Lord Kr�J).a, the enjoyer of all sacrifices and penances, is very 
fond of a briihmara like Sudama Vipra, and we have seen by the actual 
behavior of Lord Kr�'!a how much He adores such a briihmara. Therefore, 
the ideal stage of human perfection is to become a briihmara-vai§rava like 
Sudama Vipra. 
Sudama Vipra realized that although Lord Kr�'!a is unconquerable, He 
nevertheless agrees to be conquered by His devotees. He realized how kind 
Lord Kr��a was to him, and he was always in trance, constantly thinking 
of Kr��a; By such constant association with Lord Kr��a, whatever darkness 
of material contamination was remaining within his heart was completely 
cleared away, and very shortly he was transferred to the spiritual kingdom, 
which is the goal of all saintly persons in the perfectional stage of life. 
Sukadeva Gosvami has stated that all persons who hear this history of 
Sudama Vipra and Lord Kr��a will know how affectionate Lord Kr��a is 
to the briihmara devotees like Sudama. Therefore anyone who hears this 
history gradually becomes as qualified as Sudama Vipra, and he is thus 
transferred to the spiritual kingdom of Lord Kr��a. 
Thus ends the Bhaktivedanta purport of the Second Volume, Twenty­
sixth Chapter, of Kr��a, "The Briihmara Sudiimii Benedicted by Lord 
K[§[lU." 
27 I Lord Krsna and Balarama

Meet the Inhabitants of Vrndavana 
• 
Once upon a time while Lord Kr§�a and Balarama were living peacefully 
in Their great city of Dvaraka, there was the rare occasion of a full solar 
eclipse, such as takes place at the end of every kalpa, or day of Brahma. 
At the end of every kalpa the sun is covered by a great cloud, and 
incessant rain covers the lower planei:ary systems up to Svargaloka. By 
astronomical calculation, people were informed about this great eclipse 
prior to its taking place, and therefore everyone, both men and women, 
decided to assemble at the holy place in Kuruk§etra known as Samanta­
paficaka. 
The 
Samanta-paficaka 
pilgrimage 
site is celebrated because 
Lord 
Parasurama performed great sacrifices there after having killed all the 
k§atriyas in the world twenty-one times. Lord Parasurama killed all the 
k§atriyas, and their accumulated blood flowed like a stream. Lord 
Parasurama dug five big lakes at Samanta-paficaka, and filled them with 
this blood. Lord Parasurama is Vi§ru-tattva. As stated in the lsopani§ad, 
Vi§[W-tattva cannot be contaminated by any sinful activity. Yet although 
Lord Parasurama is fully powerful and uncontaminated, in order to exhibit 
ideal character, He performed great sacrifices at Samanta-paficaka to atone 
for His so-called sinful killing of the k§atriyas. By His example, Lord 
Parasurama established that the killing art, although sometimes necessary, 
is not good. Lord Parasurama considered Himself culpable for the sinful 
killing of the k§atriyas; therefore, how much more are we culpable for 
such abominable unsanctioned acts. Thus, killing of living entities is 
prohibited from time immemorial all over the world. 
Taking advantage of the occasion of the solar eclipse, all important 
persons visited the holy place of pilgrimage. Some of the important 
personalities are mentioned as follows. Among the elderly persons there 
were Akrilra, Vasudeva and Ugrasena; among the younger generation there 
190 
Lord Kr��a and Balarama Meet the Inhabitants of Vrndavana 
191 
were Gada, Pradyumna, Samba, and many other members of the Y adu 
dynasty who had come there with a view to atone for sinful activities 
accrued in the course of discharging their respective duties. Because 
almost all the members of the Y adu dynasty went to Kuruk§etra, some 
important personalities, like Aniruddha, the son of Pradyumna, and 
Krtavarma, the commander-in-chief of the Y adu dynasty, along with 
Sucandra, Suka and Sara�a remained in Dvaraka to protect the city. 
All the members of the Yadu dynasty were naturally very beautiful, 
and yet on this occasion, when they appeared duly decorated with gold 
necklaces and flower garlands, dressed in valuable clothing and properly 
armed with their respective weapons, their natural beauty and personalities 
were a hundred times enhanced. The members of the Y adu dynasty came 
to Kuruk§etra in their gorgeously decorated chariots resembling the air­
planes of the demigods, pulled by big horses that moved like the waves of 
the ocean, and some of them rode on sturdy, stalwart elephants that 
moved like the clouds in the sky. Their wives were carried on beautiful 
palanquins by beautiful men whose features resembled those of the 
Vidyadharas. The entire assembly looked as beautiful as an assembly of 
the demigods of heaven. 
After arriving in Kuruk§etra, the members of the Y adu dynasty took 
their baths ceremoniously, with self-control, as enjoined in the siistras, and 
they observed fasting for the whole period of the eclipse in order to 
nullify the reactions of their sinful activities. Since it is a Vedic custom to 
give in charity as much as possible during the hours of the eclipse, the 
members of the Yadu dynasty distributed many hundreds of cows in 
charity to the briihmar-as. All those cows were fully decorated with nice 
dress and ornaments. The special feature of these cows was that they had 
golden ankle bells and flower garlands on their necks. 
All the members of the Y adu dynasty again took their baths in the lakes 
created by Lord Parasurama. Mter this they sumptuously fed the briihma­
r-as with first-class f'ooked food, all prepared in butter. According to ·the 
Vedic system, there are two classes of food. One is called raw food, and 
the other is called cooked food. Raw food does not include raw vegetables 
and raw grains, but food boiled in water; whereas cooked food is made in 
ghee. Capatis, dahl, rice and ordinary vegetables are called raw foods, as 
are fruits and salads. But puris, kacuri, sangosas, sweet balls, etc., are called 
cooked foods. All the briihmar-as invited on that occasion by the members 
of the Y adu dynasty were fed sumptuously with cooked food. 
The ceremonial functions performed by the members of the Y adu 
dynasty externally resembled the ritualistic performances performed by 
192 
Kr��a, the Supreme Personality of Godhead 
the karmis. When a karmi performs some ritualistic ceremony, his ambition 
is sense gratification-good position, good wife, good house, good children 
or good wealth; but the ambition of the members of the Yadu dynasty 
was different. Their ambition was to offer perpetual faith and devotion to 
Kr§�a. All the members of the Y adu dynasty were great devotees. As 
such, after many births of accumulated pious activities, they were given 
the chance to associate with Lord Kr§�a. In going to take their baths in the 
place of pilgrimage at Kuruk§etra or observing the regulative principles 
during the solar eclipse or feeding the briihmarws-in all their activities­
they simply thought of devotion to Kr§�a. Their ideal worshipable Lord 
was Kr§�a, and no one else. 
After feeding the briihmarws, it is the custom for the host, with their 
permission, to accept prasiidam. Thus, with the permission of the briihma­
!1-as, all the members of the Y adu dynasty took lunch. Then they selected 
resting places underneath big, shadowy trees, and when they had taken 
sufficient rest, they prepared to receive visitors, among whom there were 
relatives and friends, as well as many subordinate kings and rule_rs. There 
were the rulers of the Matsya Province, Usinara Province, Kosala Province, 
Vidarbha Province, Kuru Province, S�fijaya Province, Kamboja Province, 
Kekaya Province and many other countries and provinces. Some of the 
rulers belonged to opposing parties, and some were friends. But above all, 
the visitors from V�ndavana were most prominent. The residents of 
V�ndavana, headed by Nanda Maharaja, had been living in great anxiety 
because of separation from Kr��a and Balarama. Taking advantage of the 
solar eclipse, they.all came to see their life and soul, K�§�a and Balarama. 
The inhabitants of V �ndavana were well-wishers and intimate friends of 
the Y adu dynasty. This meeting of the two parties after long separation 
was a very touching incident. Both the Y ad us and the residents of V �nda­
vana felt such great pleasure in meeting and talking together that it was a 
unique scene. Meeting after long separation, they were all jubilant; their 
hearts were throbbing, and their faces appeared like freshly bloomed lotus 
flowers. There were drops of tears falling from their eyes, the hair on their 
bodies stood on end, and because of their extreme ecstasy, they were 
temporarily speechless. In otJler words, they began to dive in the ocean of 
happiness. 
While the men were meeting in that way, the women were also meeting 
one another in the same manner. They were embracing each other in great 
friendship, smiling very mildly, and looking at one another with much 
affection. When they were embracing each other in their arms, the saffron 
and kunkuma spread on their breasts was exchanged from one person to 
Lord Kr��a and Balarama Meet the Inhabitants of Vrndavana 
193 
another, and they all felt heavenly ecstasy. Due to such heart-to-heart 
embracing, torrents of tears glided down their cheeks. The juniors 
were offering obeisances to the elders, and the elders were offering 
their blessings to the juniors. They were thus welcoming one anoth�r 
and asking after each other's welfare. Ultimately, however, all their 
talk was only of Kr§�a. All the neighbors and relatives were connected 
with Lord Kr§�a 's pastimes in this world, and as such Kr§�a was the 
center 
of 
all 
their 
activities. 
Whatever 
activities they performed­
social, political, religious, or conventional-were transcendental. 
The real elevation of human life rests on knowledge and renunciation. 
As stated in the Srimad-Bhiigavatam, in the First Canto, devotional service 
rendered to Kr§�a automatically produces perfect knowledge and renun­
ciation. The family members of the Y adu dynasty and the cowherd men 
of Vrndavana had their minds fixed on Kf§J).a. That is the symptom of 
all knowledge, and because their minds were always engaged in Kr§�a, 
they were automatically freed from all material activities. This stage of 
life is called yukta-vairiigya as enunciated by Srila Riipa Gosvami. Know­
ledge and renunciation, therefore, do not mean dry speculation and re­
nunciation of activities. Rather, one must start speaking and acting only 
in relationship with Kf§J).a. 
In this meeting at Kuruk§etra, Kuntidevi and Vasudeva, who were 
sister and brother, met after a long period of separation, along with their 
respective sons and .daughters-in-law, wives, children and other family 
members. By talking among themselves, they soon forgot all their past 
miseries. Kunfidevi especially addressed her brother Vasudeva as follows: 
"My dear brother, I am very unfortunate, because not one of my desires 
has ever been fulfilled; otherwise how could it happen that although I 
have such a saintly brother as yol], perfect in all respects, you did not 
inquire from me as to how I was passing my days in a distressed condition 
of life." It appears that Kunfidevi was remembering the miserable days 
when she had been banished along with her sons through the mischevious 
plans of Dhrtara§tra and Duryodhana. She continued; "My dear brother, 
I can understand that when providence goes against someone, even one's 
nearest relatives also forget him. In such a condition, even one's father, 
one's mother or one's own children will forget him. Therefore, my dear 
brother, I do not accuse you." 
Vasudeva replied to his sister: "My dear sister, do not be sorry, and do 
not blame me in that way. We should always remember that we all are only 
toys in the hands of providence. Everyone is under the control of the 
Supreme Personality ofGodhead. It is under His control only that all kinds 
194 
Kf��a, the Supreme Personality of Godhead 
of fruitive actions and the resultant reactions take place. My dear sister, 
you know that we were very much harrassed by King Kamsa, and by his 
persecutions we were scattered here and there. We were always full of 
anxieties. Only in the last few days have we returned to our own places, 
by the grace of God." 
After this conversation, Vasudeva and Ugrasena received the kings who 
came to see them, and they sufficiently welcomed them all. Seeing Lord 
Kf§!la present on the spot, all the visitors felt transcendental pleasure and 
became very peaceful. Some of the prominent visitors were as follows: 
Bhi§madeva, Dro!lacarya, Dhrtarli§tra, Duryodhana, and Gandhari along 
with her sons; King Yudhi§!hira along with his wife, and the Pa!!9-avas 
along with Kunti; Srnjaya, Vidura, Krpacarya, Kuntibhoja, Virata, King 
Nagnajit, Purujit, Drupada, Salya, Dhr§taketu, the King of Kasi, Damagho§a, 
Visalak§a, the King of Mithila, the King of Madras (formerly known as 
Madra), the King of Kekaya, Yudhamanyu, Susarma, Bahlika along with 
his sons, and many other rulers who were subordinate to King Yudhi§!hira. 
When they saw Lord Kr§�a with His thousands of queens, they became 
fully satisfied at the sight of such beauty and transcendental opulence. All 
who were there personally visited Lord Balarama and Kr§�a, and being 
properly welcomed by the Lord they began to glorify the members of the 
Y adu dynasty, especially Kr§!la and Balarama. Because he was the King of 
the Bhojas, Ugrasena was considered the chief Yadu, and therefore the 
visitors specifically addressed him: "Your majesty Ugrasena, King of the 
Bhojas, factually the Y adus are the only persons within this world who 
are perfect in all respects. All glories unto you! All glories unto you! The 
specific condition of your perfection is that you are always seeing Lord 
Kf§!la, who is sought after by many mystic yogis undergoing severe 
austerities and penances for great numbers of years. All of you are in 
direct touch with Lord Kf§!la at every moment. 
"All the Vedic hymns are glorifying the Supreme Personality of Godhead, 
Kf§!la. The Ganges water is considered sanctified because of its being the 
water used to wash the lotus feet of Lord Kr§!la· The Vedic literatures are 
nothing but the injunctions of Lord Kr§�a. The purpose of the study of 
all the Vedas is to know Kr§!la; therefore, the words of Kr§!la and the 
message of His pastimes are always purifying. By the influence of time 
and circumstances, all the opulences of this world had become almost 
completely wiped out, but since Kr§!la has appeared on this planet, all 
auspicious features have again appeared due to the touch of His lotus feet. 
Because of His presence, all our ambitions and desires are gradually being 
fulfilled. Your majesty, King of the Bhoj as, you are related with the Y adu 
Lord Kf�l)a and Balarama Meet the Inhabitants of Vrndavana 
195 
dynasty by matrimonial relationship, and by blood relationship also. As 
a result, you are constantly in touch with Lord Kf�l)a, and you have no 
difficulty in seeing Him at any time. Lord Kr�-pa moves with you, talks 
with you, sits with you, rests with you, and dines with you. The Yadus 
appear to be always engaged in worldly affairs which are considered to 
lead to the royal road to hell, but due to the presence of Lord Kr�-pa, the 
original Personality of Godhead in the Vi�D-U catagory, who is omniscient, 
omnipresent and omnipotent, all of you are factually relieved from all 
material contamination, and are situated in the transcendental position of 
liberation and Brahman existence." 
When they had heard that Kr�pa would be present in Kuruk�etra because 
of the solar eclipse, the residents of V rndavana, headed by Maharaja N anda, 
had also decided to go there, and therefore all the members of the Yadu 
dynasty were attending. King Nanda, accompanied by his cowherd men, 
had loaded all their necessary paraphernalia on bullock carts, and all of 
the V rndavana residents had come to Kuruk�etra to see their beloved sons 
Lord Balarama and Lord Kr�pa. When the cowherd men of V rndavana 
arrived in Kuruk�etra, all the members of the Y adu dynasty became most 
pleased. As soon as they saw the residents of V rndavana, they stood up to 
welcome them, and it appeared that they had again regained their life. Both 
had been very eager to meet, and when they actually came forward and met, 
they embraced one another to their heart's satisfaction and remained 
in embrace for a considerable time. 
As soon as Vasudeva saw Nanda Maharaja, he jumped and ran oyer to 
him and embraced him very affectionately. Vasudeva began to narrate 
his past history-how he had been imprisoned by King Karhsa, how his 
babies had been killed, and how immediately after Kr�pa's birth he had 
carried Him to the place of Nanda Maharaja, and how Kr�pa and Balarama 
had been raised by N anda Maharaja and his queen, Y asoda, as their own 
children. Similarly, Lord Balarama and Kr�-pa also embraced King N anda 
and mother Y asoda and then offered Their respect unto their lotus feet 
by bowing down. Because of Their filial affection for Nanda and Yasoda, 
both Lord Kr�pa and Balarama became choked up, and for a few seconds 
They could not speak. The most fortunate King Nanda and mother Yasoda 
placed their sons on their laps and began to embrace Them to their full 
satisfaction. Because of separation from Kr�pa and Balarama, both King 
Nand a and Y asoda had been merged in great distress for a very long time. 
Now, after meeting Them and embracing Them, all their sufferings were 
mitigated. 
After this, Kr�D.a's mother, Devaki, and Balarama's mother, Rohi-pi, 
196 
Kr��a, the Supreme Personality of Godhead 
both embraced mother Y asoda. They said, "Dear Queen Y asodadevi', both 
you and N anda Maharaja have been great friends to us, and when we re­
member you we are immediately overwhelmed by the thought of your 
friendly activities. We are so indebted to you that even if we were to return 
your benediction by giving you the opulence of the King of heaven, it 
would not be enough to repay you for your friendly behavior. We shall 
never forget your kindly behavior toward us. When both Kr§!la and 
Balarama were born, before they even saw Their real father and mother, 
They were entrusted to your care, and you raised Them as your own 
children, fostering Them as birds take care of their offspring in the nest. 
You have nicely fed, nourished and loved Them and have performed many 
auspicious religious ceremonies for Their benefit. 
"Actually They are not our sons; They belong to you. Nanda Maharaja 
and yourself are the real father and mother of Kf§!la and Baladima. As long 
as They were under your care They had not even a pinch of difficulty. 
Under your protection, They were completely out of the way of all kinds 
of fear. This most affectionate care which you have taken for Them is 
completely befitting your elevated position. The most noble personalities 
do not discriminate between their own sons and the sons of others, and 
there cannot be any personalities more noble than N anda Maharaja and 
yourself." 
As far as the go pis of V rndavana were concerned, from the very begin­
ning of their lives, they did not know anything beyond Kr§!la. Kr§!la and 
Balarama were their life and soul. The gopis were so attached to Kf§!la that 
they could not even tolerate not seeing Him momentarily when their 
eyelids blinked and impeded their vision. They condemned Brahma, the 
creator of the body, because he foolishly made eyelids which blinked and 
checked their seeing Kr§!la. Because they had been separated from Kr§!la 
for so many years, the gopis, having come along with Nanda Maharaja and 
mother Y asoda, felt intense ecstasy in seeing Kr§!la. No one can even 
imagine how anxious the gopis were to see Kr§!la again. As soon as Krwa 
became visible to them, they took Him inside their hearts through their 
eyes and embraced Him to their full satisfaction. Even though they were 
embracing Kf§!la only mentally, they became so ecstatic and overwhelmed 
with joy that for the time being they completely forgot themselves. The 
ecstatic trance which they achieved simply by mentally embracing Kr§!la 
is impossible to achieve even for great yogis constantly engaged in 
meditation on the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Kr§!la could under­
stand that the gopis were rapt in ecstasy by embracing Him in their minds, 
and therefore, since He is present in everyone's heart, He also reciprocated 
the embracing from within. 
Lord Kf�pa and Balarama Meet the Inhabitants of Vrndavana 
197 
Kr�pa was sitting with mother Y asoda and His other mothers, Devaki 
and Rohipi, but when the mothers engaged in talking, He took the 
opportunity and went to a secluded place to meet the gopis. As soon as He 
approached the gopis, the Lord began to smile, and after embracing them 
and inquiring about their welfare, He began to encourage them, saying, 
"My dear friends, you know that both Lord Balariima and Myself left 
Vrndavana just to please Our relatives and family members. Thus We were 
long- engaged in fighting with Our enemies and were obliged to forget you, 
who were so much attached to Me in love and affection. I can understand 
that by this action I have been ungrateful to you, but still I know you are 
faithful to Me. May I inquire if you have been thinking of Us although We 
had to leave you behind? My dear gopis, do you now dislike remembering 
Me, considering Me to have been ungrateful to you? Do you take My 
misbehavior with you very seriously? 
"After all, you should know it was not My intention to leave you; our 
separation was ordained by providence, who after all is the supreme con­
troller and does as he desires. He causes the intermingling of different 
persons, and again disperses them as he desires. Sometimes we see that due 
to the presence of clouds and strong wind, atomic particles of dust and 
broken pieces of cotton are intermingled together, and after the strong 
wind subsides, all the particles of dust and cotton are again separated, 
scattered in different places. Similarly, the Supreme Lord is the creator of 
everything. The objects which we see are different manifestations of His 
energy. By His supreme will we are sometimes united and sometimes 
separated. We can therefore conclude that ultimately we are absolutely 
dependent on His will. 
"Fortunately, you have developed loving affection for Me, which is the 
only way to achieve the transcendental position of association with Me. 
Any living entity who develops such unalloyed devotional affection for Me 
certainly at the end goes back to home, back to Godhead. In other words, 
unalloyed devotional service and affection for Me are the cause of supreme 
liberation. 
"My dear gopi friends, you may know from Me that it is My energies 
only which are acting everywhere. Take, for example, an earthen pot. It is 
nothing but a combination of earth, water, air, fire and sky. It is always of 
the same physical composites, whether in its beginning, during its exis­
tence or after its annihilation. When it is created, the earthen pot is 
made of earth, water, fire, air and sky; while it remains, it is the same in 
composition; and when it is broken and annihilated, its different ingredients 
are conserved in different parts of the material energy. Similarly, at the 
creation of this cosmic manifestation, during its maintenance, and after 
198 
Kr��a, the Supreme Personality of Godhead 
its dissolution, everything is but a different manifestation of My energy. 
And because the energy is not separate from Me, it is to be concluded that 
I am existing in everything. 
"In the same way, the body of a living being is nothing but a compo­
sition of the five elements, and the living entity embodied in the material 
condition is also part and parcel of Me. The living entity is imprisoned in 
the material condition on account of his false conception of himself as the 
supreme enjoyer. This false ego of the living entity is the cause of his 
imprisonment in material existence. As the Supreme Absolute Truth, I am 
transcendental to the living entity, as well as to his material embodiment. 
The two energies, material and spiritual, are both acting under My supreme 
control. My dear gopis, I request that instead of being so afflicted, you try 
to accept everything with a philosophical attitude. Then you will under­
stand that you are always with Me and that there is no cause of lamentation 
in our being separated from one another." 
This important instruction of Lord Kr�l)a's to the gopis can be utilized 
by all devotees engaged in Kr�l)a consciousness. The whole philosophy is 
considered on the basis of inconceivable, simultaneous oneness arid dif­
ference. In Bhagavad-gitii the Lord says that He is present everywhere in 
His impersonal feature. Everything is existing in Him, but still He is not 
personally present everywhere. The cosmic manifestation is nothing but a 
display of Kf�l)a's energy, and because the energy is not different from the 
energetic, nothing is different from Kr�l)a. When this absolute conscious­
ness, Kr�l)a consciousness, is absent, we are separated from Kr�l)a; but 
fortunately, if this Kf�l)a consciousness is present, then we are not separated 
from Kr�l)a. The process of devotional service is the revival of Krwa 
consciousness, and if the devotee is fortunate enough to understand that 
the material energy is not separated from Kr�l)a, then he can utilize the 
material energy and its products in the service of the Lord. But in the 
absence of Kr�l)a consciousness, the forgetful living entity, although part 
and parcel of Krwa, falsely puts himself in the position of e�joyer of the 
material world and, being thus implicated in material entanglement, is 
forced by the material energy to continue his material existence. This is 
also confirmed in the Bhagavad-gitii. Although a living entity is forced to 
act by the material energy, he falsely thinks that he is the aU-in-all and the 
supreme en]oyer. 
If the devotee knows perfectly that the arcii-vigraha, or Deity form of 
Lord Kf�l)a in the temple, is exactly the same sac-cid-iinanda-vigraha as 
Krwa Himself, then his service to the temple Deity becomes direct service 
to the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Similarly, the temple itself, the 
Lord Kr�!la and Balarama Meet the Inhabitants of Vrndavana 
199 
temple paraphernalia and the food offered to the Deity are also not 
separate from Kr�!J.a. One has to follow the rules and regulations prescribed 
by the iiciiryas, and thus, under superior guidance, Kr�!la-realization is 
fully possible, even in this material existence. 
The gopis, having been instructed by Kr�!la in this philosophy of simul­
taneous oneness and difference, remained always in Kr�!la consciousness 
and thus became liberated from all material contamination. The conscious­
ness of the living entity who falsely presents himself as the enjoyer of the 
material world is called jiva-kosa, which means imprisonment by the false 
ego. Not only the go pis but anyone who follows these instructions of Kr�!la 
becomes immediately freed from the jiva-kosa imprisonment. A person in 
full Kr�!la consciousness is always liberated from false egoism; he utilizes 
everything for Kr�!la's service and is not at any time separated from Kr�!J.a. 
The gopis therefore prayed to Kr�!J.a, "Dear Kr�!J.a, from Your navel 
emanated the original lotus flower which is the birthsite of Brahma, the 
creator. No one can estimate Your glories or Your opulence, which there­
fore remain always a mystery even to the highest thoughtful men, the 
masters of all yogic power. The conditioned soul fallen in the dark well of 
this material existence can very easily, however, take shelter of the lotus 
feet of Lord Kr�!J.a. Thus his deliverance is guaranteed." The go pis 
continued: "Dear Kr�!J.a, we are always busy in our family affairs. We 
therefore request that You remain within our hearts as the rising sun, and 
that v.rill be Your greatest benediction." 
The, gopis are always liberated souls, because they are fully in Kr�!la 
consciousness. They only pretended to be entangled in household affairs in 
Vrndavana. In spite of their long separation, the inhabitants of Vrndavana, 
the go pis, were not interested in the idea of going with Kr�!la to His capital 
city, Dvaraka. They wanted to remain busy in V rndavana and thus feel the 
presence of Kr�!la in every step of their lives. They immediately invited 
Kr�!la to come back to V rndavana. This transcendental emotional existence 
of the go pis is the basic principle of Lord Caitanya 's teaching. The Ratha­
yiitrii Festival observed by Lord Caitanya is the emotional process of taking 
Kr�!la back to v rndavana. Srimati Radhara!J.I refused to go with Kr�!la to 
Dvaraka to enjoy His company in the atmosphere of royal opulence, but 
wanted to enjoy His company in the original V rndavana atmosphere. Lord 
Krwa, being profoundly attached to the gopis, never goes away from 
Vrndavana, and the gopis and other residents of Vrndavana remain fully 
satisfied in Kr�!la consciousness. 
Thus ends the Bhaktivedanta purport of the Second Volume, twenty­
seventh CHapter, of Kr�!J.a, "Lord Kr§!w and Balariima Meet the Inhabitants 
of Vrndiivana." 
28 I Draupadi Meets the Queens of Kr��a 
There were many visitors who came to see Kr�l).a, and among them were 
the Pa1).9avas, headed by King YudhiHhira. After talking with the gopis and 
bestowing upon them the greatest benediction, Lord Kr�l).a came to wel­
come King Yudhi�thira and other relatives who had come to see Him. He 
first of all inquired from them whether their situation was auspicious. 
Actually, there is no question of ill fortune for anyone who sees the 
lotus feet of Lord Kr�l).a, yet when Lord Kr�l).a, as a matter of etiquette, 
inquired from King Yudhi�thira about his welfare, the King became very 
happy by such a reception and began to address the Lord thus: "My dear 
Lord Kr�l).a, great personalities and devotees in full Kr�9-a consciousness 
always think of Your lotus feet and remain fully satisfied by drinking the 
nectar of transcendental bliss. The nectar which they constantly drink 
sometimes comes out of their mouths and is sprinkled on others as the 
narration of Your transcendental activities. This nectar coming from the 
mouth of a devotee is so powerful that if one is fortunate enough to have 
the opportunity to drink it, he immediately becomes freed from the 
continuous journey of birth and death. Our material existence is caused by 
our forgetfulness of Your personality, but fortunately, the darkness of 
forgetfulness is immediately dissipated if one is privileged to hear about 
Your glories. Therefore, my dear Lord, where is the possibility of ill 
fortune for one who is constantly engaged in hearing Your glorious 
activities? 
"Since we are fully surrendered unto You and have no other shelter 
than Your lotus feet, we are always confident of our good fortune. My 
dear Lord, You are the ocean of unlimited knowledge and transcendental 
bliss. The result of the action of mental concoction is to exist in the three 
temporary phases of material life-wakefulness, sleep and deep sleep. But 
these conditions cannot exist in Kr�9-a consciousness. All such reactions 
200 
d.__ 
____ �-� 
Draupadi Meets the Queens of Kf�J)a 
201 
are invalidated by practice of Kf�J)a consciousness. You are the ultimate 
destination of all liberated persons. Out of Your independent will only, 
You have descended on this earth by the use of Your own internal 
potency, yogamiiyii, and in order to reestablish the Vedic principles of 
life, You have appeared just like an ordinary human being. Since You are 
the Supreme Person, there cannot, therefore, be any ill luck for one who 
has fully surrendered unto You." 
When Lord Kr�J)a was busy meeting various kinds of visitors and while 
they were engaged in offering prayers to the Lord, the female members of 
the Kuru dynasty and the Y adu dynasty took the opportunity of meeting 
with one another and engaging in talk of Lord Kr�J)a 's transcendental 
pastimes. The first inquiry was made by Draupadi to the wives of Lord 
Krwa. She addressed them: "My dear Rukmil)i, Bhadra, Jambavati, Satya, 
Satyabhama, Kalindi, Saibya, Lak�mal)ii, Rohil)i and all other wives of 
Lord Kf�J)a, will you please let us know how Lord Kr�J)a, the Supreme 
Personality of Godhead, accepted you as His wives and married you in 
pursuance of the marriage ceremonies of ordinary human beings? 
To this question, the chief of the queens, Rukmil)idevi, replied, "My 
dear Draupadi, it was practically a settled fact that princes like J arasandha 
and others wanted me to marry King Sisupala, and, as is usual, all the 
princes present during the marriage ceremony were prepared with their 
armor and weapons to fight with any rival who dared to stop the marriage. 
But the Supreme .Personality of Godhead kidnapped me the way a lion 
takes away a lamb from the flock. This was not, however, a very wondrous 
act for Lord Kr�J)a, because anyone who claims to be a very great hero or 
king within this world is subordinate to the lotus feet of the Lord. All the 
kings touch their helmets to the lotus feet of Lord Kr�J)a. My dear 
Draupadi, it is my eternal desire that life after life I may be engaged in the 
service of Lord Kr�J)a, who is the reservoir of all pleasure and beauty. This 
is my only desire and ambition in life." 
After this, Satyabhama began to speak. She said, "My dear Draupadi, 
my father was very much afflicted on the death of his brother, Prasena, 
and he falsely accused Lord Kr�J)a of killing his brother and stealing the 
Syamantaka jewel, which had actually been taken by Jambavan. Lord 
Kr�J)a, in order to establish His pure character, fought with Jambavan 
and rescued the Syamantaka jewel, which was later delivered to my father. 
My father was very much ashamed and sorry for accusing Lord Kr�J)a of 
his brother's death. After getting back the Syamantaka jewel, he thought 
it wise to rectify his mistake, so although he had promised others my hand 
in marriage, he submitted the jewel and myself at the lotus feet of Kr�J)a, 
1
202 
Kr�!la, the Supreme Personality of Godhead 
and thus I was accepted as His maidservant and wife." 
Mter this, Jambavati replied to Draupadi's question. She said, "My dear 
Draupadi, when Lord Kr§!la attacked my father Jambavan, the King of 
the rk§aS, my father did not know that Lord Kr§pa was his former master, 
Lord Ramacandra, the husband of Sita. Not knowing the identity of Lord 
Krwa, my father remained continually engaged in fighting with Him for 
twenty-seven days. After this period, when he became very tired and 
fatigued, he could understand that since no one but Lord Ramacandra 
could defeat him, his opponent, Lord Kr�pa, must be the same Lord 
Ramacandra. He thus came to his senses and not only immediately 
returned the Syamantaka jewel, but in order to satisfy the Lord, he 
presented me to Him to become His wife. In this way I was married to the 
Lord, and thus my desire to remain life after life as a servitor of Kr§pa was 
fulfilled." 
After this, Kalindi' said, "My dear Draupadi, I was engaged in great 
austerities and penances in order to get Lord Kr�pa as my husband. When 
Lord Kf§!la became aware of this fact, He very kindly came to m� along 
with His friend Arjuna and accepted me as His wife. Lord Kr§pa then 
took me away from the bank of Yamuna, and since then I have been 
engaged in the house of Lord Kr�pa as a sweeper. And the Lord is treating 
me as His wife." 
After this, Mitravinda said, "My dear Draupadi', there was a great 
assembly of princes at my svayamvara ceremony. Lord Kr�I}a was also 
present in that meeting, and He accepted me as His maidservant by defeat­
ing all the princes present there. He immediately took me away to Dvaraka, 
exactly as a lion takes a deer from a pack of dogs. When I was thus taken 
away by Lord Kr�pa, my brothers wanted to fight with Him, and later on 
they were defeated. Thus my desire to become the maidservant of Kr§pa 
life after life was fulfilled." 
After this, Satya addressed Draupadi in this way: "My dear Draupadi, 
my father arranged for an assembly for my svayamvara [the personal 
selection of a husband] , and in order to test the strength and heroism 
of the prospective bridegrooms, my father stipulated that they each 
fight with his seven ferocious bulls, which had long, serpentine horns. 
Many heroic prospective bridegrooms tried to defeat the bulls, but 
unfortunately they were all severely struck, and they returned to their 
homes as defeated invalids. When Lord Sri Kr�pa came and fought with 
the bulls, they were just like playthings for Him. He captured the bulls and 
roped each one of them by their nostrils. Thus they came under His control, 
just like a goat's small kids come very easily under the control of children. 
Draupadi Meets the Queens of Kr��a 
203 
My father became very pleased and married me with Lord Kr��a in great 
pomp, giving as my dowry many divisions of soldiers, horses, chariots and 
elephants, along with hundreds of maidservants. Thus Lord Kr��a brought 
me to His capital city, Dvaraka. On the way back, He was also assaulted 
by many princes, but Lord Kr�v.a defeated all of them, and thus I have the 
privilege of serving His lotus feet as a maidservant." 
After this, Bhadra began to speak. She said, "My dear Draupadi, Lord 
Kr�v.a is the son of my maternal uncle. Fortunately, I became attracted to 
His lotus feet. When my father understood these feelings of mine, he 
personally arranged for my marriage, inviting Lord Kr��a to marry me and 
giving Him in dowry one ak§auhir-i, or division of armed forces, along with 
many maidservants and other royal paraphernalia. I do not know whether 
I shall be able to have the shelter of Lord Kr��a life after life, but still I 
pray to the Lord that wherever I may take my birth I may not forget my 
relationship with His lotus feet." 
Then Lak�ma�a said, "My dear Queen, many times I have heard the 
great sage Narada glorifying the pastimes of Lord Kr�p.a. I became attracted 
to the lotus feet of Kr�p.a when I heard Narada say that the goddess of 
fortune, Lak�mi, was also attracted to His lotus feet. Since then I have 
always been thinking of Him, and thus my attraction for Him has increased. 
My dear Queen, my father was very affectionate toward me. When he 
understood that I was attracted to Kr��a, he devised a plan. His plan was 
like that devised by your father; during the svayarhvara, the prospective 
bridegrooms had to pierce the eyes of a fish with their arrows. The 
difference between the competition in your svayarhvara and mine was 
that in your case the fish was hanging openly on the ceiling, in clear view, 
but in my case the fish was covered with a cloth and could only be seen 
by the reflection of the cloth in a pot of water. That was the special 
feature of my svayarhvara. 
"The news of this device was spread all over the world, and when the 
princes heard of it, they arrived at my father's capital city from all 
directions, fully equipped with armor and guided by their military instruc­
tors. Each one of them desired to win me as his wife, and one after 
another they raised the bow and arrow which was left there for piercing 
the fish. Many could not even join the bowstring to the two ends of the 
bow, and without attempting to pierce the fish, they simply left the bow 
as it was and went away. Some with great difficulty drew the string from 
one end to the other, and being unable to tie the other end, they were 
suddenly knocked down by the spring-like bow. My dear Queen, you will 
be surprised to know that at my svayariwara meeting there were many 
204 
Kr�!�a, the Supreme Personality of Godhead 
famous kings and heroes present. Heroes like J arasandha, Amba�tha, 
Sisupala, Bhimasena, Duryodhana and Kar!la were, of course, able to 
string the bow, but they could not pierce the fish, because it was 
covered, and they could not trace it out from the reflection. The celebrated 
hero of the Pa��avas, Arjuna, was able to see the reflection of the fish on 
the water, but although with great caution he traced out the location of 
the fish and shot an arrow, he did not pierce the fish in the right spot. 
His arrow at least touched the fish, and so he proved himself better than 
all other princes. 
"All the princes who had tried to pierce the target were disappointed, 
being baffled in their attempts, and some candidates had even left the 
place without making an attempt, but when at last Lord Kr�!la took up 
the bow, He was able to tie the bowstring very easily, just as a child plays 
with a toy. He placed the arrow, �nd looking only once at the reflection of 
the fish in the water, He shot the arrow, and the pierced fish immediately 
fell down. This victory of Lord Kr��a was accomplished at noon, during 
the moment called abhijit, which is astronomically calc�.llated as ausr.icious. 
At that time the vibration of ']aya! ]aya!' was heard all over the world, 
and from the sky came sounds of drums beat by the denizens of heaven. 
Great demigods were overwhelmed with joy and began to shower flowers 
on the earth. 
"At that time, I entered the arena of competition, and the ankle bells 
on my legs were sounding very melodiously as I walked. I was nicely 
dressed with new silken garments, flowers were decorating my hair, and 
because of Lord Kr��a's victory, I was in ecstatic joy and smiling very 
pleasingly. I was carrying in my hands a golden necklace bedecked with 
jewels, which was glittered at intervals. My curling hair encircled my face, 
which was shining with a bright luster due to the reflection of my various 
rings. My eyes blinking, I first of all observed all the princes present, and 
when I reached my Lord I very slowly placed the golden necklace on His 
neck. As I have already informed you, from the very beginning my mind 
had been attracted by Lord Kr��a, and thus I considered the garlanding 
of the Lord to be my great victory. As soon as I placed my garland on the 
neck of the Lord, there sounded immediately the combined vibration of 
mrdangas, patahas, conchshells, drums, kettledrums and other instruments, 
causing a tumultuous sound, and while the music played, expert male and 
female dancers began to dance, and singers began to sing sweetly. 
"My dear Draupadi, when I accepted Lord Kr��a as my worshipable 
husband, and He also accepted me as His maidservant, there was a 
tumultuous roaring among the disappointed princes. All of them became 
Draupadi Meets the Queens of Kr�t�a 
205 
very agitated because of their lusty desires, but without caring for them, 
my husband, in His form as the four-handed Naraya�a, immediately took 
me on His chariot, which was drawn by four excellent horses. Expecting 
opposition from the princes, He armored Himself and took up His bow 
named Sani.ga, but our celebrated driver, Daruka, drove the beautiful 
chariot without a moment's delay toward the city of Dvaraka. Thus, in the 
presence of all the princes, I was carried away very quickly, exactly as a 
deer is carried away from the flock by a lion. Some of the princes, 
however, wanted to check our progress, and thus,.equipped with proper 
weapons, they opposed us, just as dogs try to oppose the progressive march 
of a lion. At that time, due to the arrows released by the Sani.ga bow of 
Lord Kr��a, some of the princes were cut on their left hands, some of 
them lost their legs, and some lost their heads and their lives, and others 
fled from the battlefield. 
"The Supreme Personality of Godhead then entered the most celebrated 
city of the universe, Dvaraka, and as He entered the city, He appeared like 
the shining sun. The whole city of Dvaraka was profusely decorated on 
that occasion. There were so many flags and festoons and gates all over 
Dvaraka that the sunshine could not even enter the city. I have already 
told you that my father was very much affectionate to me, so when he 
saw that my desire was fulfilled by getting Lord Kr��a as my husband, in 
great happiness he began to distribute to friends and relatives various kinds 
of gifts, such as valuable dresses, ornaments, bedsteads and sitting carpets. 
Lord Kr��a is always self-sufficient, yet my father, out of his own accord, 
offered my husband a dowry consisting of riches, soldiers, elephants, 
chariots, horses and many rare and valuable weapons. He presented all 
these to the Lord with great enthusiasm. My dear Queen, at that time I
could guess that in my previous life I must have performed some wonder­
fully pious activity, and as a result I can in this life be one of the 
maidservants in the house of the Supreme Personality of Godhead." 
When all the principal queens of Lord Kr��a had finished their state· 
ments, Rohi�i, as the representative of the other sixteen thousand queens, 
began to narrate the incident of their becoming wives of Kr��a. 
"My dear Queen, when Bhaumasura was conquering all the world, he 
collected wherever possible all the beautiful daughters of the kings and 
kept us arrested within his palace. When news of our imprisonment reached 
Lord Kr��a, He fought with Bhaumasura and released us. Lord Kr�!la 
killed Bhaumasura and all his soldiers, and although He had no need to 
accept even one wife, He nevertheless, by our request, married all sixteen 
thousand of us. My dear Queen, our only qualification was that we were 
206 
Kr��a, the Supreme Personality of Godhead 
always thinking of the lotus feet of Lord Kr��a, which is the way to 
release oneself from the bondage of repeated birth and death. My dear 
Queen Draupadi, please take it from us that we are not after any opulence 
such as kingdom, empire, or a position of heavenly enjoyment. We do not 
want to enjoy such material opulences, nor do we desire to achieve the 
yogic perfections, nor the exhalted post of Lord Brahma. Nor do we want 
any of the different kinds of liberation -salokya, sar�ti, siimipya or sayujya. 
We are not at all attracted by any of these opulences. Our only ambition 
is to bear on our heads life after life the dust particles attached to the 
lotus feet of Lord Krwa. The goddess of fortune also desired to keep 
that dust on her breast along with the fragrant saffron. We simply desire 
this dust, which accumulates underneath the lotus feet of Kr�!la as He 
travels on the land of V rndavana as a cowherd boy. The gop is especially, 
and also the cowherd men and the aborigine tribeswomen, always desire 
to become the grass and straw on the street of V rndavana, to be trampled 
on by the lotus feet of Kr�!la. My dear Queen, we wish to remain as such 
life after life, without any other desire." 
Thus ends the Bhaktivedanta purport of the Second Volume, Twenty­
eighth Chapter, of Kr�!la, "Draupadi Meets the Queens of K[§!W." 
29 I Sacrificial Ceremonies 
Performed by Vasudeva 
Among the women present at Kuruk�etra during the solar eclipse were 
Kunti, Gandhari, Draupadi, Subhadra and the queens of many other kings, 
as well as the gopis from Vrndavana. When the different queens of Lord 
Kr��a were submitting their statements as to how they were married and 
accepted by Lord Kr��a as His wives, all the female members of the Kuru 
dynasty were struck with wonder. They were filled with admiration at 
how all the queens of Kr��a were attached to Him with love and affection. 
When they heard about the queens' intensity of love and affection for 
Krwa, they could not check their eyes from filling up with tears. 
While the women were engaged in conversations among themselves and 
the men were similarly engaged in conversation, there arrived almost all 
the important sages and ascetics from all directions, who had come for the 
purpose of seeing Lord Kr��a and Balarama. Chief among the sages were 
Kr��a-dvaipayana Vyasa, the great sage Narada, Cyavana, Devala, Asita, 
Visvamitra, Satananda, Bharadvaja, Gautarrta, and Lord Parasurama along 
with his disciples; Vasi�tha, Galava, Bhrgu, Pulastya, Kasyapa, Atri, 
Marka��eya, Brhaspati, Dvita, Trita, Ekata; the four Kumara sons of 
Brahma, Sanaka, Sanandana, Sanatana and Sanatkumara; Angira and 
Agastya, Yajfiavalkya and Vamadeva. 
As soon as the sages and ascetics arrived, all the kings, including 
Maharaja Yudhi�!hira and the Pa��avas and Lord Kr��a and Balarama, 
immediately got up from their seats and offered their respects by bowing 
down to the universally respected sages. After this, the sages were properly 
welcomed by being offered seats and water for washing their feet. Palatable 
fruits, garlands of flowers, incense, and sandalwood pulp were presented, 
and all the kings, led by Kr��a and Balarama, worshiped the sages according 
to the Vedic rules and regulations. When all the sages were comfortably 
seated, Lord Kr��a, who descended for the protection of religion, began 
207 
\ 
208 
Kr��a, the Supreme Personality of Godhead 
to address them on behalf of all the kings. When Kr��a began to speak, all 
became silent, being eager to hear and understand His welcoming words to 
the sages. 
Lord Kr��a spoke thus: "All glories to the assembled sages and ascetics! 
Today we are all feeling that our lives have become successful. Today we 
have achieved the desired goal of life, because we are now seeing face to 
face all the exalted liberated sages and ascetics whom even the great demi­
gods in the heavens desire to see. Persons who are neophytes in devotional 
service and who simply offer their respectful obeisances to the Deity in 
the temple but cannot realize that the Lord is situated in everyone's 
heart, and those who simply worship different demigods for fulfillment 
of their own lusty desires, are unable to understand the importance of 
these sages. They cannot take advantage of receiving these sages by 
seeing them with their eyes, by touching their lotus feet, by inquiring 
about their welfare or by diligently worshiping them." 
Neophyte devotees or religionists cannot understand the importance of 
great mahatmas. They go to the temple as a matter of formality and pay 
their respectful obeisances unto the Deity. When one ·is promoted to the 
next platform 
of trance consciousness, one can understand the im­
portance of mahatmas and devotees, and in that stage the devotee 
tries to please them. Therefore, Lord Kr��a said that the neophyte cannot 
understand the importance of great sages, devotees or ascetics. 
Kr��a continued, "One cannot purify himself by traveling to holy 
places of pilgrimage and taking bath there or by seeing the Deities in the 
temples. But if one happens to _meet a great devotee, a mahatma who is 
representative of the Personality of Godhead, one becomes immediately 
purified. In order to become purified, there is the injunction to worship 
the fire, the sun, the moon, the earth, the water, the air, the sky and the 
mind. By worshiping all the elements and their predominating deities, one 
can become free from the influence of envy, but all the sins of an envious 
person can be nullified immediately simply by serving a great soul. My 
dear revered sages and respectable kings, you can take it from Me that a 
person who accepts this material body made of three elements-mucus, 
bile and air-as his own self, who considers his family and relatives as his 
own, and who accepts material things as worshipable, or who visits holy 
places of pilgrimage just to take a bath there, but never associates with 
great personalities, sages and mahatmas-such a person, even in the form of 
a human being, is nothing but an animal, like an ass." 
When the supreme authority, Lord Kr��a, was thus speaking with great 
gravity, all the sages and ascetics remained in dead silence. They became 
Sacrificial Ceremonies Performed by Vasudeva 
209 
amazed upon hearing Him speaking the absolute philosophy of life in such 
a concise way. Unless one is very much advanced in knowledge, one thinks 
his body to be his self, his family members to be his kith and kin, and the 
land of his birth to be worshipable. From this concept of life, the modern 
ideology of nationalism has sprung up. Lord Krwa condemned such ideas, 
and He also condemned persons who take the trouble to go to holy places 
of pilgrimage just to take a bath and come back without taking the oppor­
tunity to associate with the great devotees and mahiitmiis living there. 
Such persons are compared to the most foolish animal, the ass. All those 
who heard considered the speech of Lord Kr��a for some time, and they 
concluded that Lord Kr��a was actually the Supreme Personality of God­
head, playing the role of an ordinary human being who is forced to take 
a certain type of body as a result of the reactions of his past deeds. He 
was assuming this pastime as an ordinary human simply to teach the people 
in general how they should live for perfection of the human mission. 
Having concluded that Kr��a was the Supreme Personality of Godhead, 
the sages began to address Him thus: "Dear Lord, we., the leaders of 
human society, are supposed to possess the proper philosophy of life,.and 
yet we are becoming bewildered by the spell of Your external energy. We 
are surprised to see Your behavior, which is just like that of an ordinary 
human being and which conceals Your real identity as the Supreme Per­
sonality of Godhead, and we therefore consider Your pastimes to be 
all-wonderful. 
"Our dear Lord, by Your own energy You are creating, maintaining and 
annhilating the whole cosmic manifestation of different names and forms, 
in the same way as the earth creates many forms of stone, trees and other 
varieties of names and forms and yet remains the same. Although You are 
creating varieties of manifestation through Your energy, You are unaffected 
by all those actions. Our dear Lord, we remain simply stunned by seeing 
Your wonderful actions. Although You are transcendental to this entire 
material creation and are the Supreme Lord and the Supersoul of all living 
entities, You nevertheless appear on this earth by Your internal potency 
to protect Your devotees and destroy the miscreants. By such appearance 
You reestablish the principles of eternal religion, which the human society 
forgets by long association with the material energy. Our dear Lord, You 
are the creator of the social orders and spiritual statuses of the human 
society according to quality and work, and when these orders are misguided 
by unscrupulous persons, You appear and set them right. 
"Dear Lord, the Vedic knowledge is the representation of Your pure 
heart. Austerities, study of the Vedas, and meditative trances lead to 
210 
Kr��a, the Supreme Personality of Godhead 
different realizations of Your Self in Your manifested and nonmanifested 
aspects. The entire phenomenal world is a manifestation of Your imper­
sonal energy, but You Yourself, as the original Personality of Godhead, 
are nonmanifested there. You are the Supreme Soul, the Supreme Brahman. 
Persons who are situated in brahminical culture, therefore, can understand 
the truth about Your transcendental form. Thus You always hold the 
briihmar-as in respect, and thus You are considered to be the topmost 
of all followers of brahminical culture. You are therefore known as 
brahma1Jya-deva. Our dear Lord, You are the last word in good fortune and 
the last resort of all saintly persons; therefore we all consider that we have 
achieved the perfection of our life, education, austerity and acquisition of 
transcendental knowledge by meeting You. Factually, You are th_e ultimate 
goal of all transcendental achievements. 
"Our dear Lord, there is no end to Your unlimited knowledge. Your 
form is transcendental, eternally existing in full bliss and knowledge. You 
are the Supreme Personality of Godhead, the Supreme Brahman, the Su­
preme Soul. Being covered by the spell of Your internal potency, yogamiiyii, 
You are now temporarily concealing Your unlimited potencies, but still 
we can understand Your exalted position, and therefore all of us offer You 
our respectful obeisances. Dear Lord, You are enjoying Your pastimes in 
the role of a human being, concealing Your real character of transcendental 
opulence; therefore, all the kings who are present here, even the members 
of the Y adu dynasty who are constantly mingling with You, eating with 
You, and sitting with You, cannot understand that You are the original 
cause of all causes, the soul of everyone, the original cause of all creation. 
"When a person dreams at night, hallucinatory figures created by the 
dream are accepted as real, and the imaginary dream body is accepted as 
one's real body. For the time being one forgets that besides the body 
created in hallucination, -there is another, real body in his awakened state. 
Similarly, in the awakened state also, the bewildered conditioned soul 
considers sense enjoyment to be real happiness. 
"By the process of enjoyment of the senses of the material body, the 
spirit soul is covered, and his consciousness becomes materially contami­
nated. It is due to material consciousness that one cannot understand the 
Supreme Personality of Godhead, Krwa. All great mystic yogis endeavor 
to revive their Kr��a consciousness by mature practice of the yoga system 
and thus understand Your lotus feet and meditate upon Your transcen­
dental form. In this way the accumulated result of sinful activities is 
counteracted. It is said that the water of the Ganges can vanquish volumes 
of a person's sinful actions, but the Ganges water is glorious only due to 
Sacrificial Ceremonies Performed by Vasudeva 
211 
Your lotus feet. The Ganges water is flowing as perspiration from the lotus 
feet of Your Lordship. And we are all so fortunate that today we have 
been able to directly see Your lotus feet. Dear Lord, we are all surrendered 
souls, devotees of Your Lordship; therefore, please be kind and bestow 
Your causeless mercy upon us. We know well that persons who have 
become liberated by constant engagement in Your devotional service are 
no longer contaminated by the material modes of nature; thus they have 
become eligible to be promoted to the kingdom of God in the spiritual 
world." 
After first offering prayers to Lord Krwa, the assembled sages wanted 
to take permission from King Dhftara�tra and King Yudhi�thira and then 
depart for their respective iisramas. At that time, however, Vasudeva, 
the father of Lord Kr��a and the most celebrated of all pious men, 
approached the sages and with great humility offered his respects by falling 
down at their feet. Vasudeva said, "My dear great sages, you are more 
respected than the demigods. I therefore offer my respectful obeisances 
unto you. I wish that you will accept my one request, if you so desire. I 
shall consider it a great blessing if you kindly explain the supreme fruitive 
activity by which one can counteract the reactions of all other activities." 
The great sage Narada was the leader of all the sages present there. 
Therefore he began to speak. "My dear sages," he said, "it is not very 
difficult to understand that because of his great goodness and simplicity, 
Vasudeva, who has .become the father of the Personality of Godhead by 
accepting Kr��a as his son, is inclined to ask us about his welfare. It is said 
that familiarity breeds contempt. As such, Vasudeva, having Kr��a as his 
son, does not regard Kr��a with awe and veneration. Sometimes it is seen 
that persons who are living on the bank of the Ganges do not consider the 
Ganges to be very important, and they go far away in order to take their 
baths at a place of pilgrimage. Being that Lord Kr��a, whose knowledge is 
never second in any circumstances, is personally present, there is no need 
of Vasudeva's asking us for instruction. 
"Lord Kr��a is not affected by the process of creation, maintenance and 
annihilation; His knowledge is never influenced by any agency beyond 
Himself. He is not agitated by the interaction of the material qualities, 
which changes things in the modes of time. His transcendental form is full 
of knowledge which never becomes agitated by ignorance, pride, attach­
ment, envy or sense enjoyment. His knowledge is never subjected to the 
laws of karma regarding pious or impious activities; nor is it influenced 
by the three modes of material energy. No one is greater than or equal to 
Him, because He is the supreme authority, the Personality of Godhead. 
212 
Kr��a, the Supreme Personality of Godhead 
"The ordinary conditioned human being may think the conditioned 
soul, who is covered by his materialistic senses, mind and intelligence, to 
be equal to Kr§�a, but Lord Kr��a is just like the sun, which, although it 
sometimes may appear to be so, is never covered by the cloud, snow or fog 
or by other planets. When the eyes of less intelligent men are covered by 
such influences, they think the sun to be invisible. Similarly, persons 
influenced by the senses and addicted to material enjoyment cannot have 
a clear vision of the Supreme Personality of Godhead." 
The sages present then began to address Vasudeva in the presence of 
Lord Kr§�a, Balarama and many other kings, and, as requested by him, 
they gave their instructions: "To counteract the reaction of karma, or 
desires impelling one to fruitive activities, one must execute the prescribed 
sacrifices which are meant for worshiping Lord Vi§�U with faith and 
devotion. Lord Vi§�U is the beneficiary of the results of all sacrificial 
performances. 
Great personalities and sages who are sufficiently ex­
perienced to possess vision of the three phases of the time element, 
namely past, present and future, and tl;wse who are able to see everything 
clearly through the eyes of revealed scriptures, have unanimously recom­
mended that to purify the dust of material contamination accumulated 
in the heart and to clear the path of liberation and thereby achieve tran­
scendental bliss, one must please Lord Vi§�U. For everyone in the different 
social orders (briihmarw, k§atriya and vaisya) who are living as house­
holders, this worship of the Supreme Personality of Godhead Lord Vi§�U, 
who is known as Puru�ottama, the original person, is recommended as the 
only auspicious path. 
"All conditioned souls within this material world have deep-rooted 
desires to lord it over the resources of material nature. Everyone wants to 
accumulate riches, everyone wants to enjoy life to the greatest extent, 
everyone wants a wife, home and children, and everyone wants to become 
happy in this world and be elevated to the heavenly planets in the next 
life. But these desires are the causes of one's material·bondage. Therefore, 
to get liberation from this bondage, one has to sacrifice his honestly 
earned riches for the satisfaction of Lord Vi��u. 
"The only process to counteract all sorts of material desire is to 
engage oneself i� the devotional service of Lord Vi§�U. In this way a 
self-controlled person, even while remaining in householder life, should 
give up the three kinds of material desires, namely desire for the acquisition 
of material opulences, the enjoyment of wife and children, and elevation 
to higher planets. Eventually he may give up householder life and accept 
the renounced order of life, engaging himself completely in the devotional 
Sacrificial Ceremonies Performed by Vasudeva 
213 
service of the Lord. Everyone, even if born in a higher status of life as 
briihmarta, k§atriya, or vaisya, is certainly indebted to the demigods, to 
the sages, to the forefathers, to living entities and so on, and in order to 
liquidate all these debts, one has to perform sacrifices, study the Vedic 
literature, and generate children in religious householder life. If somehow 
one accepts the renounced order of life without fulfilling this debt, 
certainly he falls down from his position. Today you have already 
liquidated your debts to your forefathers and the sages. Now, by perform­
ing sacrifices, you can free yourself from indebtedness to the demigods 
and thus take complete shelter of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. 
My dear Vasudeva, certainly you have already performed many pious 
activities in your previous lives. Otherwise, how could you be the father of 
Kr��a and Balarama, the Supreme Personality of Godhead?" 
Saintly Vasudeva, after hearing all the sages, offered his respectful 
obeisances unto their lotus feet. In this way he pleased the sages, and then 
he elected for them to perform the yajfias. When the sages were elected 
as priests of the sacrifices, they also in their turn induced Vasudeva to 
collect the required paraphernalia for executing the yajfias in that place 
of pilgrimage. Thus Vasudeva was persuaded to start to perform the yajfias, 
and all the members of the Yadu dynasty took their baths, dressed them­
selves very nicely, and decorated themselves beautifully and garlanded 
themselves with lotus flowers. Vasudeva's wives, dressed with nice garments 
and ornaments and .golden necklaces, approached the arena of sacrifice 
carrying in their hands the required articles to offer in the sacrifice. 
When everything was complete, there was heard the vibration of 
mrdangas, conchshells, kettledrums and other musical instruments. Profes­
sional dancers, both male and female, began. to dance. The siitas and
miigadhas, who were professional singers, began to offer prayers by singing. 
The Gandharvas and their wives, whose voices were very sweet, began to 
sing many auspicious songs. Vasudeva anointed his eyes with collyrium, 
smeared butter over his body, and then, along with his eighteen wives, 
headed by Devaki, sat before the priests to be purified by the abhi§eka 
ceremony. All such ceremonies were observed strictly according to the 
principles of scriptures, as was done formerly in the case of the moon with 
the stars. Vasudeva, because he was being initiated for the sacrifice, was 
dressed in deerskin, but all his wives were dressed with very nice saris, 
bangles, 
necklaces, 
ankle bells, earrings and many other ornaments. 
Vasudeva looked very beautiful surrounded by his wives, exactly like the 
King of heaven when he performs such sacrifices. 
At that time, when Lord Kr��a and Lord Balarama, along with Their 
214 
Kr��a, the Supreme Personality of Godhead 
wives, children and relatives, sat dow:n in that great sacrificial arena, it 
appeared that the Supreme Personality of Godhead was present along with 
all His part and parcel living entities and multi-energies. We have heard 
from the siistras that Lord Kr��a has multi-energies and parts and parcels, 
but now in that sacrificial arena all could actually experience how the 
Supreme Personality of Godhead eternally exists along with His different 
energies. At that time, Lord Kr��a appeared as Lord Nadiya�a, and Lord 
Balarama appeared as Sankar§a�a, the reservoir of all living entities. 
Vasudeva satisfied Lord Vi§�U by performing different kinds of sacrifices, 
such as jyoti§toma, dar§a and pilrr-amiisa. Some of these yajnas are called 
priikrta, and some of them are known as sauryasatra or vaikrta. Thereafter, 
the other sacrifices, known as agnihotra, were also performed, and the 
prescribed articles were offered in the proper way. In this way Lord Vi§�U 
became pleased. The ultimate purpose of offering oblations in sacrifice is 
to please Lord Viwu. But in this age of Kali it is very difficult to collect 
the different articles required for offering sacrifices. People have neither 
the means to collect the required paraphernalia nor the necessary knowledge 
or tendency to offer such sacrifices. Therefore, in this age of Kah, when 
people are mostly unfortunate, full of anxieties and disturbed by various 
kinds of calamities, the only sacrifice recommended is the performance of 
sankirtana-yajna. Worshiping Lord Caitanya by this sankirtana-yajna is the 
only recommended process in this age. 
After the performance of the different sacrifices, Vasudeva offered 
ample riches, clothing, ornaments, cows, land and maidservants to the 
priests. Thereafter, all the wives of Vasudeva took their avabhrtha baths 
and performed the part of the sacrificial duties known as patnisamyiija. 
After finishing the offering with all the required paraphernalia, they all 
took their baths together in the lakes constructed by Parasurama, which 
are known as the Rama-hrada. After Vasudeva and his wives took their 
baths, all the garments and ornaments which they wore were distributed 
to the subordinate persons who were engaged in singing, dancing and 
similar activities. We may note that the performance of sacrifice ne­
cessitates the profuse distribution of riches. Charity is offered to the 
priests and the briihma!las in the beginning, and used garments and 
ornaments are offered in charity to the subordinate assistants after the 
performance of the sacrifice. 
After offering the used articles to the singers and reciters, Vasudeva and 
his wives, dressed with new ornaments and dresses, fed everyone very 
sumptuously, beginning from the briihmar-as down to the dogs. After this, 
all the friynds, family members, wives and children of Vasudeva, along 
Sacrificial Ceremonies Performed by Vasudeva 
215 
with all the kings and members of the Vidarbha, Kosala, Kuru, Kasi, 
Kekaya and Srnjaya dynasties, assembled together. The priests, the 
demigods, the people in general, the forefathers, the ghosts and the Ciira­
fl.US were all sufficiently remunerated by being offered ample gifts and 
respectful honor. Then all the persons assembled there took permission from 
Lord Kr§f}a, the husband of the goddess of fortune, and while glorifying 
the perfection of the sacrifice made by Vasudeva, they departed to their 
respective homes. 
'
At that time, when King Dhrtara§tra, Vidura, Yudhi§thira, Bhima, 
Arjuna, Bhi§madeva, Dropacarya, Kunti, Nakula, Sahadeva, Narada, Lord 
Vyasadeva and many other relatives and kinsmen were about to part, 
they felt separation and therefore embraced each and every member of the 
Y adu dynasty with great feeling. Many others who were assembled in that 
sacrificial arena also departed. After this, Lord Kr§I}a and Lord Balarama, 
along with King Ugrasena, satisfied the inhabitants of Vrndavana, headed 
by Maharaja Nanda and the cowherd men, by profusely offering all kinds 
of gifts in order to worship them and please them. Out of their great 
feelings of friendship, the inhabitants of v rndavana remained there for a 
considerable time along with the members of the Yadu dynasty. 
After performing this sacrifice, Vasudeva felt so satisfied that there 
was no limit to his happiness. All the members of his family were with 
him, and in their presence he caught hold of the hands of N anda 
Maharaja and addressed him thus: "My dear brother, the Supreme Person­
ality of Godhead has created a great tie of bondage which is known as the 
bondage of love and affection. I think it is a very difficult job for even the 
great sages and saintly persons to cut such a tie of love. My dear bro­
ther, you have exhibited feelings of love for me, which I was not able 
to return. I think, therefore, that I am ungrateful. You have behaved 
exactly as is characteristic of saintly persons, but I shall never be able to 
repay you. I have no means to repay you for your friendly dealings. 
Nevertheless I am confident that our tie of love will never break. Our 
relationship of friendship must ever continue, in spite of my inability to 
repay you·. I hope you will excuse me for this inability. 
"My dear brother, in the beginning, due to my being imprisoned, I
could never serve you as a friend, and although at the present moment I
am very opulent, because of my material prosperity I have become blind. 
I therefore cannot satisfy you properly even at this time. My dear brother, 
you are so nice and gentle that you offer all respect to others, but you 
don't care for any respect for yourself. A person seeking for auspicious 
progress in life must not possess too much material opulence with which 
216 
Kr��a, the Supreme Personality of Godhead 
to become blind and puffed up, but he should take care of his friends and 
relatives." 
When Vasudeva was speaking to Nanda Maharaja in this way, he was 
influenced by a great feeling for the friendship of N anda Maharaja and the 
beneficial activities executed by King Nanda on his behalf. As such, his 
eyes filled with tears, and he began to cry. Desiring to please his friend 
Vasudeva and being affectionately bound with love for Lord Kr��a and 
Balarama, Nanda Maharaja passed three months in their association. At 
the end of this time, all the members of Y adu dynasty tried to please the 
inhabitants of V�ndavana to their hearts' content. The members of the 
Yadu dynasty tried to satisfy Nanda Maharaja and his associates by 
offering them clothing, ornaments, and many other valuable articles, and 
they all became fully satisfied. Vasudeva, Ugrasena, Lord KHI}a, Lord 
Balarama, U ddhava and all other members of the Y adu dynasty presented 
their individual gifts to Nanda Maharaja and his associates. After Nanda 
Maharaja received these farewell presentations, he, along �ith his associates, 
started for Vrajabhiimi, Vrndavana. The minds of the inhabitants of 
Vrndavana remained, however, with Kr��a and Balarama, and therefore all 
of them started for Vrndavana without their minds. 
When the members of the Vr�l}i family saw all their friends and visitors 
departing, they observed that the rainy season was approaching, and thus 
they decided to return to Dvaraka. They were fully satisfied, for they 
regarded Kr��a as everything. When they returned to Dvaraka, they began 
with great satisfaction to describe the sacrifice performed by Vasudeva, 
their meeting with various friends and well-wishers, and various other 
incidences which occurred during their travels in the places of pilgrimage. 
Thus ends the Bhaktivedanta purport of the Second Volume, Twenty­
Ninth Chapter, of Kr��a, "Sacrificial Ceremonies Performed by Vasudeva." 
30 I Spiritual Instruction for Vasudeva 
and Return of the Six Dead Sons 
of Devaki by Lord Kr��a 
It is a Vedic custom that the junior members of the family should 
offer respects to the elderly persons every morning. The children or the 
disciples especially should offer their respects to the parents or the 
spiritual master in the morning. In pursuance of this Vedic principle, Lord 
Kr�!la and Balarama used to offer Their obeisances to Their father, Vasu­
deva, along with his wives. One day, after having returned from the 
sacrificial performances at Kuruk�etra, when Lord Kr�!la and Balarama 
went to offer Their respect to Vasudeva, Vasudeva took the opportunity 
of appreciating the exalted position of his two sons. Vasudeva had the 
opportunity to understand the position of Kr�!la and Balarama from the 
great sages who had. assembled in the arena of the sacrifice. He not only 
heard from the sages, but on many occasions he actually experienced that 
Kr�!la and Balarama were not ordinary human beings, but were very 
extraordinary. Thus he believed the words of the sages that his sons Kr�!la 
and Balarama were the Supreme Personality of Godhead. 
With firm faith in his sons, he addressed them thus: "My dear Kr�!la, 
You are the sac-cid-iinanda-vigraha Supreme Personality of Godhead, and 
my dear Balarama, You are Sankar�a!la, the master of all mystic powers. I 
have now understood that You are eternal. Both of You are transcendental 
to this material manifestation and to its cause, the Supreme Person Maha­
Vi�!lu. You -are the original controller of all. You are the rest of this cosmic 
manifestation. You are its creator, and You are also its creative ingredients. 
You are the master of this cosmic manifestation, and actually this manifes­
tation is created for Your pastimes only. 
"The different material phases from the beginning to the end of the 
cosmos manifest under different time formulas are also Yourself, because 
You are both the cause and effect of this manifestation. The two features 
of this material world, the predominator and the predominated, are also 
217 
218 
Kr��a, the Supreme Personality of Godhead 
You, and You are the supreme transcendental controller who stands above 
them. Therefore, You are beyond the perception of our senses. You are 
the supreme soul, unborn and unchanging. You are not affected by the six 
kinds of transformations which occur in the material body. The wonderful 
varieties of this material world are also created by You, and You have 
entered as the Supersoul into each living entity and even into the atom. 
You are the maintainer of everything. 
"The vital force which is acting as the life principle in everything and 
the creative force derived from it are not acting independently, but are 
dependent upon You, the Supreme Person behind these forces. Without 
Your will, they cannot work. Material energy has no cognizance. It cannot 
act independently without being agitated by You. Because the material 
nature is dependent upon You, the living entities can only attempt to act; 
But without Your sanction and will they cannot perform anything or 
achieve the result they desire. 
"The original energy is only an emanation from You. My dear Lord, the 
shining of the moon, the heat of the fire, the rays of the sun, the glittering 
of the stars, and the electric lightning which is manifested as very powerful, 
as well as the gravity of the mountains, the energy of the earth and the 
quality of its flavor-all are different manifestations of You. The pure 
taste of water and the vital force which maintains all life are also features 
of Your Lordship. The water and its taste are also Yourself. 
"My dear Lord, although the forces of the senses, the mental power of 
thinking, willing and feeling, and the strength, movement and growth of 
the body appear to be performed by different movements of the airs within 
the body, they are all ultimately manifestations of Your energy. The vast 
expanse of outer space rests in Yourself. The vibration of the sky, its 
thunder, the supreme sound omkiira and the arrangement of different 
words to distinguish one thing from the other are symbolic representations 
of Yourself. Everything is Yourself. The senses, the controllers of the senses, 
the demigods, and the acquisition of knowledge which is the purpose of the 
senses, as well as the subject matter of knowledge-all are Yourself. The 
resolution of intelligence and the sharp memory of the living entity are also 
Yourself. You are the egotistic principle in ignorance which is the cause of 
this material world, the egotistic principle of passion which is the cause of 
the senses, and the egotistic principle of goodness which is the origin or the 
different controlling deities of this material world. The illusory energy, or 
miiyii, which is the cause of the conditioned soul's perpetual transmigration 
from one form to another, is Yourself. 
"My dear Supreme Personality of Godhead, You are the original cause 
Return of the Six Dead Sons of Devaki by Lord Kr��a 
219 
of all causes� exactly as the earth is the original cause of different kinds of 
trees� plants and similar varieties of manifestation. As the earth is represent­
ed in everything� so You are present throughout this material manifestation 
as Supersoul. You are the supreme cause of all causes� the eternal prin­
ciple. Everything is� in fact� a manifestation of Your one energy. The 
three qualities of material nature -sattva, rajas and tamas-and the result 
of their interaction� are linked up with You by Your agency of yogamiiyii. 
They are supposed to be independent� but actually the total material 
energy is resting upon You� the Supersoul. Since You are the supreme 
cause of everything� the interactions of material mani.festation-birth� 
existence� growth� transformation� deterioration and annihilation-are 
all absent in Yourself. Your supreme energy� yogamiiyii, is acting in 
variegated manifestations� but because yogamiiyii is Your energy� You are 
therefore present in everything." 
In the Bhagavad-gitii, this fact is very nicely explained in the Ninth Chap­
ter�. wherein the Lord says� "In My impersonal form I am spread all over the 
material energy; everything is resting in Me� but I am not there." This 
very statement is also given by Vasudeva. To say He is not present every­
where means that He is aloof from everything� although His energy is 
acting everywhere. This can be understood by a crude example: In a big 
establishment� the energy� or the organization of the supreme boss� is 
working in every nook and corner of the business� but that does not mean 
that the original proprietor is present there� although in every department 
and every atmosphere the presence of the proprietor is felt by the worker. 
The 
physical 
presence 
of 
the 
proprietor 
in every department is 
formality only. Actually his energy is working everywhere. Similarly� the 
omnipresence of the Supreme Personality of Godhead is felt in the 
action of His energies. Therefore the philosophy of inconceivable simul­
taneous oneness with and difference from the Supreme Lord is confirmed 
everywhere. The Lord is one� but His energies are diverse. 
Vasudeva said� "This material world is like a great flowing river� and its 
waves are the three material modes of nature-goodness� passion and ig­
norance. This material body� as well as the senses� the faculties of thinking� 
feeling and willing and the stages of distress� happiness� attachment and 
lust-all are different products of these three qualities of nature. The fool­
ish person who cannot realize Your transcendental identity above all this 
material reaction continues to remain in the entanglement of fruitive 
activity and is subjected to the continuous process of birth and death 
without a chance of being freed. 
This is also confirmed in a different way by the Lord in the Fourth 
220 
Kf�l)a, the Supreme Personality of Godhead 
Chapter of Bhagavad-gitii. There it is said that anyone who knows the 
appearance and activities of the Supreme Lord Kf�l)a becomes freed from 
the clutches of material nature and goes back home, back to Godhead. 
Therefore Kr�l)a 's transcendental name, form, activities and qualities are 
not products of this material nature. 
"My dear Lord," Vasudeva continued, "despite all these defects of the 
conditioned soul, if someone somehow or other comes in contact with 
devotional service, he achieves this civilized human form of body with 
developed consciousness and thereby becomes capable of executing further 
progress in devotional service. And yet, illusioned by the external energy, 
people generally do not utilize this advantage of the human form of life. 
Thus they miss the chance of eternal freedom and unnecessarily spoil 
the progress they have made after thousands of births. 
"In the bodily concept of life, one is attached to the offspring of the 
body, due to false egotism, and everyone in conditioned life is entrapped 
by false relationships and false affection. The whole world is moving under 
this false impression of material bondage. I know that neither of You are 
my sons; You are the original chief and progenitor, the Personalities of 
Godhead, known as Pradhana and Puru�a. But You have appeared on the 
surface of this globe in order to minimize the burden of the world by 
killing the k§atriya kings who are unnecessarily increasing their military 
strength. You have already informed me about this in the past. My dear 
Lord, You are the shelter of the surrendered soul, the supreme well-wisher 
of the meek and humble. I am therefore taking shelter of Your lotus feet, 
which alone can give one liberation from the entanglement of material 
existence. 
"For a long time I have simply considered this body to be myself, and 
although You are the Supreme Personality of Godhead, I consider You 
to be my son. My dear Lord, at the very moment when You first appeared 
in Kamsa's prison house, I was informed that You were the Supreme Per­
sonality of Godhead and that You had descended for the protection of the 
principles of religion as well as the destruction of the unfaithful. Although 
unborn, You descend in every millennium to execute Your mission. My 
dear Lord, as in the sky there are many forms appearing and disappearing, 
so You also appear and disappear in many eternal forms. Who, th�refore, 
can understand Your pastimes or the mystery of Your appearance and 
disappearance? Our only business should be to glorify Your supreme 
greatness." 
When Vasudeva was addressing his divine sons in that way, Lord Kr�l)a 
and Balarama were smiling. Because They are very affectionate to Their 
Return of the Six Dead Sons of Devaki by Lord .Kf��a 
221 
devotees, They accepted all the appreciation of Vasudeva with a kindly 
smiling attitude. Kr�tta then began to confirm all Vasudeva's statements as 
follows: "My dear father, whatever you may say, We are, after all, your 
sons. What you have said about us is certainly a highly philosophical 
understanding of spiritual knowledge. I accept it in total without excep­
tion." 
Vasudeva was in the complete perfection of life in considering Lord 
Kf§tta and Balarama to be his .sons, but because the sages assembled in the 
place of pilgrimage at Kuruk§etra had spoken about the Lord as the su­
preme cause of everything, Vasudeva simply repeated it out of his love 
for Kr§tta and Balarama. Lord Kr§tta did not wish to detract from His 
relationship with Vasudeva as father and son; therefore in the very 
beginning of His reply He accepted the fact that He is the eternal son of 
Vasudeva and that Vasudeva is the eternal father of Krsna. After this, 
.
.
. 
Lord Kr§tta informed His father of the spiritual identity of all living entities. 
He continued, "My dear father, everyone, including Myself and My brother 
Balarama, as well as all the inhabitants of the city of Dvaraka and the 
whole cosmic manifestation, is exactly as you have already explained, but 
all of us are also qualitatively one." 
Lord Kr§tta intended for Vasudeva to see everything in the vision of a 
mahiibhiigavata, a first-class devotee. A first-class devotee sees that all 
living entities are part and parcel of the Supreme Lord and that the Su­
preme Lord is situated in everyone's heart. In fact, every living entity has 
spiritual identity, but in contact with material existence he becomes 
· 
influenced by the material modes of nature. He becomes covered by the 
concept of bodily life, forgetting that his spirit soul is of the same quality 
as the Supreme Personality of Godhead. One mistakenly considers one 
individual to be different from another simply because of their material 
bodily coverings. Because of differences between bodies, the spirit soul 
appears before us differently. 
Lord Kr§tta then gave a nice example in terms of the five material 
elements. The total material elements, namely, the sky, the air, the fire, 
the water and the earth, are present in everything in the material world, 
whether in an earthen pot or in a mountain or in the trees or in an earring. 
These five elements are present in everything, in different proportions
and quantities. A mountain is a gigantic form of the combination of these 
five elements, and a small earthen pot is of the same elements, but in a 
smaller quantity. Therefore all material items, although in different shapes
or different quantities, are of the same ingredients. Similarly, the living 
entities-beginning from Lord Kr§tta and including the Vi§'[lU-tattva and 
222 
Kr��a, the Supreme Personality of Godhead 
millions of Vi§�U forms, and then the living entities in different forms, 
beginning from Lord Brahma down to the small ant-are all of the same 
quality in spirit. Some are great in quantity, and some are small, but 
qualitatively they are of the same nature. It is therefore confirmed in the 
Upani§ads that Kf§l).a, or the Supreme Lord, is the chief among all living 
entities, and He maintains them and supplies them with all necessities of 
life. Anyone who knows this philosophy is in perfect knowledge. The 
Vedic version tat tvam asi, "Thou art the same," does not mean that 
everyone is God, but everyone is qualitatively of the same nature as that of 
God. 
After hearing Kf§l).a speak the entire philosophy of spiritual life in an 
abbreviated summation, Vasudeva was exceedingly pleased with his son. 
Being 
thus 
elated, 
he 
could 
not 
speak, but remained silent. In 
the meantime, Devaki, the mother of Lord Kr�l).a, sat by the side of her 
husband. Previously she had heard that both Kr§!la and Balarama were so 
kind upon Their teacher that They had brought back the teacher's dead 
sons fro-m the clutches of the superintendent of death, Y amaraja. Since she 
had heard this incident, she had been also thinking of her own sons who 
were killed by Kamsa, and while remembering them she became over­
whelmed with grief. 
In compassion .for her dead sons, Devaki began to appeal to Lord Krwa 
and Balarama thus: "My dear Balarama, Your very name suggests that You 
give all pleasure and all strength to everyone. Your unlimited potency is 
beyond the reach of our minds and words, and my dear Kf§l).a, You are 
the master of all mystic yogis. I also know that You are the master of the 
Prajapatis like Brahma and his assistants, and You are the original Per­
sonality of Godhead, Naraya�a. I also know for certain that You have 
descended to annihilate all kinds of miscreants who have been misled in 
the course of time. They have lost control of their minds and senses, 
fallen from the quality of goodness, and have deliberately neglected the 
direction of the revealed scriptures by living a life of extravagancy and 
impudency. You have descended on the earth to minimize the burden of 
the world by killing such miscreant rulers. My dear Kf§l).a, I know that 
Maha-Vi§I).U, who is lying in the causal ocean of the cosmic manifestation 
and who is the source of this whole creation, is simply an expansion of 
Your plenary portion. Creation, maintenance and annihilation of this 
cosmic manifestation are being effected only by Your plenary portion. I 
am, therefore, taking shelter of You without any reservation. I have heard 
that when You wanted to reward Your teacher, Sandipani Muni, and he 
asked You to bring back his dead son, You and Balarama immediately 
Return of the Six Dead Sons of Devaki by Lord Kr��a 
223 
brought him from the custody of Y amaraja, although he had been dead 
for a·very long time. By this act I understand You to be the supreme master 
of all mystic yogis. I am, therefore, asking You to fulfill my desire in the 
same way. In other words, I am asking You to bring back all my sons who 
were killed by Kamsa; upon Your bringing them back, my heart will be 
content, and it will be a great pleasure for me just to see them once." 
After hearing Their mother speak in this way, Lord Balarama and Kr�p.a 
immediately called for the assistance of yogamiiyii and started for the lower 
pJanetary 
system known as Sutala. Formerly, in His incarnation of 
Vamana, the Supreme Personality of Godhead was satisfied by the king of 
the demons, Bali Maharaja, who donated to Him everything he had. Bali 
Maharaja was theri given the whole of Sutala for his residence and king­
dom. Now when this great devotee, Bali Maharaja, saw that Lord Balarama 
and Kr�p.a had come to his planet, he immediately merged in the ocean 
of happiness. As soon as he saw Lord Kr�p.a and Balarama in his presence, 
he and all his family members stood up from their seats and bowed down 
at the lotus feet of the Lord. Bali Maharaja offered Lord Kr�p.a. and 
Balarama the best seat he had in his possession, and when both Lords 
were seated comfortably, he began to wash Their lotus feet. He then 
sprinkled the water on his head and on the heads of his family members. 
The water used to wash the lotus feet of Kr�p.a and Balarama can purify 
even the greatest demigods, such as Lord Brahma. 
After this, Bali_ Maharaja brought valuable garments, ornaments, sandal­
wood pulp, betel nuts, lamps and various nectarean foodstuffs, and along 
with his family members he worshiped the Lord according to the regulative 
principles and offered his riches and body unto the lotus feet of the Lord. 
King Bali was feeling such transcendental pleasure that he repeatedly 
grabbed the lotus feet of the Lord and kept them on his chest; and 
sometimes he put them on the top of the head, and in this way he _was 
feeling transcendental bliss. Tears of love and affection began to flow 
down from his eyes, and all his hairs stood on end. He began to offer 
prayers to the Lords in a voice which choked up intermittently. 
"My Lord Balarama, You are the original Anantadeva. You are so great 
that Anantadeva Se�a and other transcendental forms have originally 
emanated from You and Lord Kr��a. You are the original Personality of 
Godhead, and Your eternal form is all-blissful and full of complete 
knowledge. You are the creator of the whole world. You are the original 
initiator and propounder of the systems of jiiiina-yoga and bhakti-yoga. 
You are the Supreme Brahman, the original Personality of Godhead, I 
therefore with all respect offer my obeisances unto both of You. My 
224 
.Kf�J)a, the Supreme Personality of Godhead 
dear Lords, it is very difficult for the living entities to get to see You, yet 
when You are merciful upon Your devotees it becomes easy for them to 
see You. As such, only out of Your causeless mercy have You agreed to 
come here and be visible to us, who are generally influenced by the 
qualities of ignorance and passion. 
"My dear Lord, we belong to the daitya or demon category. The 
demons or demonic persons-the Gandharvas, the Sid�has, the Vidyadharas, 
the Cara!J.as, the Y ak�as, the Rak�asas, the Pisacas, the ghosts and the 
hobgoblins-are incapable, by nature, of worshiping You or becoming 
Your devotees. Instead of becoming Your devotees, they simply become 
impediments on the path of devotion. But, opposed to them, You are 
the Supreme Personality of Godhead, representing all the Vedas and 
situated in the mode of uncontaminated goodness. Your position is 
always transcendental. For this reason, some of us, although born of the 
modes of passion and ignorance, have taken shelter of Your lotus feet and 
become devotees. Some of us are actually pure devotees, and some of us 
have taken shelter of Your lotus feet, desiring to gain something from 
devotion. 
"By Your causeless mercy only we demons are in direct contact with 
Your personality. This contact is not possible even for the great demigods. 
No one knows how You act through Your yogamiiyii potency. Even demi­
gods cannot calculate the expanse of the activities of Your internal potency, 
so how is it possible for us to know it? I therefore place my humble 
prayers before You: please be kind to me, who am fully surrendered unto 
You, and favor me with Your causeless mercy so that I may simply 
remember Your lotus feet birth after birth. My only ambition is that I 
may live alone just like the paramaharhsas who, traveling alone here and 
there in great peace of mind, depend simply upon Your lotus feet. I also 
desire that if I have to associate with anyone, they may be only Your pure 
devotees and no one else, because Your pure devotees are always well­
wishers of all living entities. 
. 
"My dear Lord, You are the supreme master and director of the whole 
world. Please, therefore, engage me in Y pur service and let me thus become 
freed from all material contaminations. You can purify me in that way 
because if someone engages himself in the loving service of Your Lordship, 
he immediately becomes free from all kinds of regulative principles enjoined 
in the Vedas." 
The word paramaharhsa mentioned here means the supreme swan. It is 
said that the swan can draw milk out from a reservoir of wa�er; it can take 
only the milk portion and reject the watery portion. Similarly, a person 
who can draw out the spiritual portion from this material world and who 
Return of the Six Dead Sons of Devaki by Lord Kr��a 
225 
can live alone, depending only on the Supreme Spirit, not on the material 
world, is called paramahamsa. When one achieves the paramahamsa plat­
form, he is no longer under the regulative principles of the Vedic injunctions. 
A paramahamsa accepts only the association of pure devotees and rejects 
others who are too materially addicted. In other words, those who are 
materially addicted cannot understand the value of the paramahamsa, but 
those who are fortunately advanced in spiritual sense take shelter of the 
paramahamsa and thus successfully complete the mission of human life. 
After Lord Krwa heard the prayers of Bali Maharaja, He spoke as fol­
lows: "My dear King of the demons, in the millennium of the Svayambhuva 
Manu, the Prajapati known as Marici begot six sons, all demigods, in the 
womb of his wife, Dr�a. Once upon a time, Lord Brahma became captivated 
by the beauty of his daughter and was following her, impelled by sex 
desire. At that time, these six demigods looked at the action of Lord 
Brahma with abhorrence. This criticism of Brahma's action by the demi­
gods constituted a great offense on their part, and for this reason they 
were condemned to take birth as the sons of the demon Hira�yakasipu. 
These sons of Hira�yakasipu were thereafter put in the womb of mother 
Devaki, and as soon as they took their birth, Kamsa killed them one after 
another. My dear King of the demons, again, mother Devaki is very 
anxious to see these six dead sons again, and she is very much aggrieved on 
account of their early death at the hand of Kamsa. I know that all of them 
are living with you. I have decided to take them with Me in order to 
pacify My mother Devaki. After seeing My mother, all these six conditioned 
souls will be liberated, and thus in great pleasure they will be transferred 
to- their original planet. The names of these six conditioned souls are as 
follows: Smara, Udgitha, Pari�variga, Patariga, K�udrabhrt and Ghgti They 
will be again reinstated in their former position as demigods." 
After thus informing the King of the demons, Kr��a stopped speaking, 
and Bali Maharaja understood the Lord's purpose. He worshiped Him 
sufficiently, and thereafter Lord Kr��a and Lord Balarama took away the 
six conditioned souls and returned to the city of Dvaraka, where He 
presented them as little babies before His mother, Devaki. Mother Devaki 
became overwhelmed with joy and was so ecstatic in motherly feeling 
that immediately milk began to flow from her breasts, and she fed the 
babies with great satisfaction. She began to take them on her lap again and 
again, smelling their heads and thinking, "He has gotten my lost children 
back!" For the time being she became overpowered by the energy of 
Vi��u, and in great motherly affection she began to enjoy the company of 
her lost children. 
The milk from the breast of Devaki was transcendental nectar because 
226 
Kr��a, the Supreme Personality of Godhead 
the same milk had been sucked by Lord Kr��a. As such, the babies who 
sucked the breast of Devakfji, which had touched the body of Lord Krwa, 
immediately became self-realized persons. The babies therefore began to 
offer their obeisances unto Lord Kr��a, Balarama, their father Vasudeva, 
and mother Devaki. After this, they were immediately transferred to their 
respective heavenly planets. 
After they departed, Devaki became stunned with wonder that her dead 
children had come back and had again been transferred to their respective 
planets. 
She could adjust the events only by thinking of Lord Kr��a's 
pastimes, in which, because Lord Kr��a's potencies are all inconceivable, 
anything wonderful can be performed. Without accepting the inconceivable, 
unlimited potencies of the Lord, one cannot understand that Lord Kr�!la 
is the Supreme Soul. By His unlimited potencies, He performs unlimited 
pastimes also, and no one can describe them in full nor can anyone know 
them all. Siita Gosvami, speaking Srimad-Bhiigavatam before the sages of 
Naimi�ara!lya, headed by Saunaka ��i, gave his verdict in this connection 
as follows. 
"Great sages, please understand that the transcendental pastimes of 
Lord Kr��a are all eternal. They are not ordinary narrations of historical 
incidences. Such narrations are identical with the Supreme Personality of 
Godhead Himself. Anyone, therefore, who hears such narrations of the 
Lord's pastimes becomes immediately freed from the contamination of 
material existence. And those who are pure devotees enjoy these narrations 
as nectar entering into their ears." Such narrations were described by 
Sukadeva Gosvami, the exalted son of Vyasadeva, and anyone who hears 
them, as well as anyone who describes them for the hearing of others, 
becomes Kr��a conscious. And it is only the Kr�!la conscious persons who 
become eligible for going back home, back to Godhead. 
Thus ends the Bhaktivedanta purport of the Second Volume, Thirtieth 
Chapter, of Kr�!la, "Spiritual Instruction for Vasudeva and Return of the 
Six Dead Sons of Devaki by Lord Krrra." 
31 I The Kidnapping of Subhadra and Lord 
Kr�!ia's Visiting Srutadeva and Bahulasva 
After hearing this incident, King Parik�it became more inquisitive to 
hear about Kr��a and His pastimes, and thus he inquired from Sukadeva 
Gosvami how his grandmother Subhadra was kidnapped by his grandfather 
Arjuna at the instigation of Lord Kr��a. King Parilqit was very much eager 
to learn about his grandfather's kidnapping and marriage of his gJ;and­
mother. 
Thus Sukadeva Gosvami began to narrate the story as follows: HOnce 
upon a time, your grandfather Arjuna, the great hero, was visiting several 
holy places of pilgrimage, and while he was thus traveling all over he 
happened to come to the Prabhasak�etra. In the Prabhasak�etra he heard 
the news that Lord Balarama was negotiating the marriage of Subhadra, 
the daughter of Arjuna 's maternal uncle, Vasudeva. Although her father, 
Vasudeva, and her brother, Kr��a, were not in agreement with Him, Bala­
rama was in favor of marrying Subhadra to Duryodhana. Arjuna, however, 
desired to gain the hand of Subhadra." 
As he thought of Subhadra and her beauty, Arjuna became more and 
more captivated with the idea of marrying her, and with a plan in �ind 
he dressed himself like a Vai��ava sannyiisi, carrying a tridaruJa in his hand. 
The Mayavadi sannyiisis take one dar;uja, or one rod, whereas the Vai��ava 
sannyiisis take three dart�a, or three rods. The three rods, or trida'{l�a, indi­
cate that a Vai��ava sannyiisi vows to render service to the Supreme 
Personality of Godhead by his body, mind and words. The system of 
tridart�a-sann yiisa has been in existence for a long time, and the Vai��ava 
sannyiisis are called tridart�is, or sometimes trida[l�i-sviimis or trida'{l�i­
gosviitnis. 
Sannyiisis are generally meant to travel all over the country for preaching 
work, but during the four months of the rainy season in India, from 
. September through December, they do not travel, but take shelter in one 
227 
228 
Kr��a, the Supreme Personality of Godhead 
place and remain there without moving. This non-movement of the 
sannyiisi is called Ciiturmiisya-vrata. When a sannyiisi stays in a place for 
four months, the local inhabitants of that place take advantage of his 
presence to become spiritually advanced. Arjuna, in the dress of a tridaru}i­
sannyiisi, remained in the city of Dvaraka for four months, devising a plan 
whereby he could get Subhadra as his wife. The inhabitants of Dv�raka as 
well as Lord Balarama could not recognize the sann yiisi to be Arjuna; 
therefore all of them offered their respect and obeisances to the sannyiisi 
without knowing the actual situation. 
One day Lord Balarama invited this particular sannyiisi to lunch at His 
home. Balaramaji very respectfully offered him all kinds of palatable 
dishes, and the so-called sannyiisi was eating sumptuously. While eating 
at the home of Balaramaji, Arjuna was simply looking over beautiful 
Subhadra, who was very enchanting even to the great heroes and kings. 
Out of love for her, Arjuna's eyes brightened, and he began to see her with 
glittering eyes. Arjuna decided that somehow or other he would achieve 
Subhadra as his wife, and his mind became agitated on account of this 
strong desire. 
Arjuna, the grandfather of Maharaja Parik�it, was himself extraordinarily 
beautiful, and his bodily structure was very much attractive to Subhadra. 
Subhadra also decided within her mind that she would accept only Arjuna 
as her husband. As a simple girl, she was smiling with great pleasure, 
looking at Arjuna. Thus Arjuna also became more and more attracted by 
her. In this way, Subhadra dedicated herself to Arjuna, and he resolved to 
marry her by any means. He then became absorbed twenty-four hours a 
day in the thought of how he could get Subhadra as his wife. He was 
afflicted with the thought of getting Subhadra, and had not a moment's 
peace of mind. 
Once upon a time, Subhadra, seated on a chariot, came out of the 
palace fort to see the gods in the temple. Arjuna took this opportunity, 
and with the permission of Vasudeva and Devaki, he kidnapped her. After 
getting on Subhadra's chariot, he prepared himself for a fight. Taking up 
his bow and holding off with his arrows the soldiers ordered to check him, 
Arjuna took Subhadra away. While Subhadra was being thus kidnapped by 
Arjuna, her relatives and family members began to cry, but still he took 
her, just as a lion takes his share and departs. When it was disclosed to 
Lord Balarama that the so-called sannyiisi was Arjuna and that he had 
planned such a device simply to take away Subhadra and that he had ac­
tually taken her, He became very angry. Just as the waves of the ocean be­
come agitated on a full moon day, Lord Balarama became greatly disturbed. 
The Kidnapping of Subhadra 
229 
Lord Kr��a was in favor of Arjuna; therefore, along with other members 
of the family, He tried to pacify Balarama by falling at His feet and beg­
ging Him to pardon Arjuna. Lord Balarama was then convinced that 
Subhadra was attached to Arjuna, and He became pleased to know that 
she wanted Arjuna as her husband. The matter was settled, and in order 
to please the newly married couple, Lord Balarama arranged to send a 
dowry, consisting of an abundance of riches, elephants, chariots, horses, 
servants and maidservants. 
Maharaja Parilqit was very anxious to hear more about Kr��a, and so, 
after finishing the narration of Arjuna 's kidnapping Subhadra, Sukadeva 
Gosvami began to narrate another story, as follows. 
There was a householder briihmarza in the city of Mithila, the capital of 
the kingdom of Videha. This briihmarza, whose name was Srutadeva, was a 
great devotee of Lord Kr��a. Due to his being fully Kr�!la conscious and 
always engaged in the service of the Lord, he was completely peaceful in 
mind and detached from all material attraction. He was very learned and 
had no other desire than to be fully situated in Kr��a consciousness. Al­
though in the order of householder life, he never took great pains to earn 
anything for his livelihood; he was satisfied with whatever he could achieve 
without much endeavor, and somehow or other he lived in that way. Every 
day he would get necessities for life in just the quantity required, and not 
more. That was his destiny. The briihmarza had no desire to get more than 
what he needed, and thus he was peacefully executing the regulative 
principles of a bri!hmarza's life, as enjoined in the revealed scriptures. 
Fortunately, the King of Mithila was as good a devotee as the b riihmarza. 
The name of this famous King was Bahulasva. He was very well established 
in his reputation as a good king, and he was not at all ambitious to extend 
his kingdom for the sake of sense gratification. As such, both the briihmarza 
and King Bahulasva remained pure devotees of Lord Krwa in Mithila. 
Since Lord Kr�!la was very merciful upon these two devotees, King 
Bahulasva and the briihmarza, Srutadeva, He one day asked His driver, 
Daruka, to take His chariot into the capital city of Mithila. Lord Kr�!la 
was accompanied by the great sages Narada, Vamadeva, Atri, Vyasadeva, 
Parasurama, Asita, Aru�i, Brhaspati, Ka!!va, Maitreya, Cyavana and others. 
Lord Kr�!la and the sages were passing through many villages and towns, 
and everywhere the citizens would receive them with great respect and 
offer them articles in worship. When the citizens came to see the Lord and 
all of them assembled together in one place, it seemed that the sun was 
present along with his various satellite planets. In that journey, Lord 
Kr�!la and the sages passed through the kingdoms of Anarta, Dhanva, 
230 
Kr�!J.a, the Supreme Personality of Godhead 
Kurujangala, Kanka, Matsya, Paficala, Kunti, Madhu, Kekaya, Kosala and 
Aqta, and thus all the citizens of these places, both men and women, 
could see Lord Krwa eye to eye. In this way they enjoyed celestial 
happiness, with open hearts full of love and affection for the Lord, and 
when they saw the face of the Lord, it seemed to them that they were 
drinking nectar through their eyes. When they saw Kr�!la, all the ignorant 
misconceptions of their lives dissipated. When the Lord passed through the 
various countries and the people came to visit Him, simply by glancing 
over them the Lord would bestow all good fortune upon them and liberate 
them from all kinds of ignorance. In some places, the demigods also 
would join with the human beings, and their glorification of the Lord 
would cleanse all directions of all inauspicious things. In this way, Lord 
Krwa slowly and gradually reached the kingdom of Videha. 
When the news of the Lord's arrival was received by the citizens, they 
all felt unlimited happiness and came to welcome Him, taking gifts in 
their hands to offer. As soon as they saw Lord Kr�!la, their hearts imme­
diately blossomed in transcendental bliss, just as a lotus flower blooms on 
the rising of the sun. Previously they had simply heard the names of the 
great sages, but had never seen them. Now, by the mercy of Lord Kr�!la, 
they had the opportunity of seeing both the great sages and the Lord 
Himself. 
King Bahulasva, as well as the briihmm;ta, Srutadeva, knowing well that 
the Lord had come there just to grace them with favor, immediately fell at 
the Lord's lotus feet and offered their respects. With folded hands, the 
King and the briihmarw each simultaneously invited Lord Kr�!la and all 
the sages to his home. In order to please both of them, Lord Krwa ex­
panded Himself into two and went to the houses of each one of them; yet 
neither the King nor the briihmarw could understand that the Lord had 
gone to the house of the other. Both thought that the Lord had gone only 
to his own house. That He and His companions were present in both 
houses, although both the briihmarw and the King thought He was present 
in his house only, is another opulence of the Supreme Personality of 
Godhead. This opulence is described in the revealed scriptures as vaibhava­
prakiisa. Similarly, when Lord Kr�!la married sixteen thousand wives, He 
also expanded Himself into sixteen thousand forms, each one of them as 
powerful as He Himself. Similarly, in Vrndavana, when Brahma stole away 
Kr�!la 's cows, calves and cowherd boys, Kr�!la expanded Himself into 
many new cows, calves and cowherd boys. 
Bahulasva, the King of Videha, was very intelligent and was a perfect 
gentleman. He was astonished that so many great sages, along with the 
The Kidnapping of Subhadra 
231 
Supreme Personality of Godhead, were personally present in his home. He 
knew perfectly well that the conditioned soul, especially when engaged in 
worldly affairs, cannot be a hundred percent pure, whereas the Supreme 
Personality of Godhead and His pure devotees are always transcendental 
to worldly contamination. Therefore, when he found that the Supreme 
Personality of Godhead Kr�:tJ.a and all the great sages were at his home, he 
was astonished, and he began to thank Lord Kr�:tla for His causeless mercy. 
Feeling very much obliged and wanting to receive his guests to the best 
of his capacity, he called for nice chairs and cushions, and Lord Kr�:tJ.a, 
along with all the sages, sat down very comfortably. At that time, King 
Bahulasva 's mind was very restless, not because of any problems, but 
because of great ecstasy of love and devotion. His heart was filled with 
love and affection for the Lord and His associates, and his eyes were filled 
with tears of ecstasy. He arranged to wash the feet of his divine guests, and 
after washing them he and his family members sprinkled the water on their 
own heads. After this, he offered to the guests nice flower garlands, 
sandalwood pulp, incense, new garments, ornaments, ·lamps, cows and 
bulls. In a manner just befitting his royal position, he worshiped each one 
of them in this way. When all had been fed sumptuously and were sitting 
very comfortably, Bahulasva came before Lord Kr�:tJ.a and caught His lotus 
feet. He placed them on his lap and, while massaging the feet with his 
hands, began to speak about the glories of the Lord in a sweet voice. 
"My dear Lord, You are the Supersoul of all living entities and as 
witness within the heart are cognizent of everyone's activities. As such, 
being duty-bound, we always think of Your lotus feet so that we can 
remain in a secure position without deviating from Your eternal service. 
As a result of our continuous remembrance of Your lotus feet, You have 
kindly visited my place personally to favor me with Your causeless mercy. 
We have heard, my dear Lord, that by Your various statements You 
confirm Your pure devotee£ to be more dear to You than Lord Balarama 
or Your constant servitor the goddess of fortune. Your devotees are dearer 
to You than Your first son, Lord Brahma, and I am sure that You have so 
kindly visited my place in order to prove Your divine statement. I cannot 
imagine how people can be godless and demoniac even after knowing of 
Your causeless mercy and affection for Your devotees who are constantly 
engaged in Kr�:tla consciousness. How can they forget Your lotus feet? 
"My dear Lord, it is known to us that You are so kind and liberal that 
when a person leaves everything just to engage in Kr�:tJ.a consciousness, 
You sometimes give Yourself in exchange for that unalloyed service. You 
have appeared in the Y adu dynasty to fulfill Your mission of reclaiming 
232 
Kr��a, the Supreme Personality of Godhead 
all conditioned souls rotting in the sinful activities of material existence, 
and this appearance is already famous all over the world. My dear Lord, 
You are the ocean of unlimited mercy, love and affection. Your transcen­
dental form is full of bliss, knowledge and eternity. You can attract 
everyone's heart by Your beautiful form as Syamasundara, Kr§!J-a. Your 
knowledge is unlimited, and to teach all people how to execute devotional 
service You have sent Your incarnation Nara-Naraya!J-a, who is engaged in 
severe austerities and penances at Badarinaraya!J-a. Kindly, therefore, 
accept my humble obeisances at Your lotus feet. My dear Lord, I beg to 
request You· and Your companions, the great sages and briihmarws, to 
remain at my place so that this family of the famous King Nimi may be 
sanctified by the dust of Your lotus feet at least for a few days." Lord 
Kf§!la could not refuse the request of His devotee, and thus He remained 
there for a few days along with the sages in order to sanctify the city of 
Mithila and all its citizens. 
Meanwhile, the briihmarw, simultaneously receiving Lord Kr§!J-a and His 
associates at his home, became transcendentally overwhelmeq with joy. 
After offering his guests nice sitting places, the briihmarw began to dance, 
throwing his wrap around his body. Srutadeva, being not at all rich, 
offered only mattresses, wooden planks, straw carpets, etc., to his distin­
guished guests, Lord Kr§!la and the sages, but he welcomed them to his 
best capacity. He began to speak very highly of the Lord and the sages, 
and he and his wife washed the feet of each one of them. After this, he 
took the water and sprinkled it over all the members of his family, and 
although it appeared that the briihmarw was very poor, he was at that time 
most fortunate. While Srutadeva was welcoming Lord Kr§!la and His asso­
ciates, he simply forgot himself in transcendental joy. After welcoming the 
Lord and His companions, according to his capacity he brought fruits, 
incense, scented water, scented clay, tulasi leaves, kusa straw and lotus 
flowers. They were not very costly items and could be secured very easily, 
but because they were offered with devotional love, Lord Kf§!J-a and His 
associates accepted them very gladly. The briihmm:w's wife cooked very 
simple foods like rice and dahl, and Lord Krwa and His followers were 
very pleased to accept them because they were offered in devotional love. 
When Lord Kf§!la and His associates were fed in this way, the briihmarw
Srutadeva was thinking thus: "I am fallen into the deep, dark well of 
householder life and am the most unfortunate person. How has it become 
possible that Lord :Kr§!J-a, who is the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and 
His associates, the great sages, whose very presence makes a place as 
sanctified as a pilgrimage site, have agreed to come to my place?" While 
The Kidnapping of Subhadra 
233 
the briihmara was thinking in this way, the guests finishe,d their lunch and 
sat back very comfortably. At that time, the briihmara, Srutadeva, and his 
wife, children and other relatives, appeared there to render service to the 
distinguished guests. While touching the lotus feet of Lord Kr�!J.a, the 
briihmara began to speak. 
"My dear Lord," he said, "You are the Supreme Person, Puru�ottama, 
situated transcendentally to the manifested and unmanifested material 
creation. The activities of this material world and of the conditioned souls 
have nothing to do with Your position. We can appreciate that it is not 
that only today You have given me Your audience. You are associating 
with all the living entities as Paramatma since the beginning of creation." 
This statement of the briihmara is very instructive. It is a fact that the 
Supreme Lord Personality of Godhead in His Paramatma feature entered 
the creation of this material world as Maha-Viwu, Garbhodakasayi Vi�!J.U 
and K�irodakasayi Vi�!J.u, and in a very friendly attitude the Lord is sitting 
along with the conditioned soul in the body. Therefore, every living entity 
has the Lord with him from the very beginning, but due to his mistaken 
consciousness of life, the living entity cannot understand this. When his 
consciousness is, however, changed into Kr�!la consciousness, he can 
immediately understand how Kr�!la is trying to assist the conditioned 
souls to get out of the material entanglement. 
Srutadeva continued, "My dear Lord, You have entered this material 
world as if in a sleeping condition. A conditioned soul, while sleeping, 
creates false or temporary worlds; he becomes busy in many illusory 
activities-sometimes becoming a king, sometimes being murdered or 
sometimes going to an unknown city-and all these are simply temporary 
affairs. Similarly, Your Lordship, apparently also in a sleeping condition, 
enters this material world to create a temporary manifestation, not for 
Your personal necessities, but for the conditioned soul who wants to imi­
tate Your Lordship as enjoyer. The conditioned soul's enjoyment in the ma­
terial world is temporary and illusory. And yet the conditioned soul is by 
himself unable to create such a temporary situation for his illusory enjoy­
ment. In order to fulfill his desires, although they are temporary and 
illusory, You enter in this temporary manifestation to help him. Thus, 
from the beginning of the conditioned soul's entering into the material 
world, You are his constant companion. When, therefore, the conditioned 
soul comes in contact with a pure devotee and takes to devotional service, 
beginning from the process of hearing Your transcendental pastimes, 
glorifying Your transcendental activities, worshiping Your eternal form 
in the temple, offering prayers to You and engaging in discussion to 
-
'"· 
234 
Kr��a, the Supreme Personality of Godhead 
understand Your transcendental position, he then gradually becomes 
freed from the contamination of material existence. His heart becomes 
cleansed of all material dust, and thus gradually You become visible in the 
heart of the devotee. Although You are constantly with the conditioned 
soul, only when he becomes purified by devotional service do You become 
revealed· to him. Others, who are bewildered by fruitive activities, either 
by Vedic injunction or customary dealings, and who do not take to 
devotional service, become captivated by the external happiness of the 
bodily concept of life. You are not revealed to such persons. Rather, You 
remain far, far away from them. But for one who, being engaged in Your 
devotional service, has purified his heart by constant chanting of Your 
holy name, You become very easily understood as his eternal constant 
compamon. 
"It is said that Your Lordship, sitting in the heart of a devotee, gives 
him direction by which he can very quickly come back to home, back to 
You. This direct dictation by You reveals Your existence within t�e heart 
of the devotee. Only a devotee can immediately appreciate Your existence 
within his heart, whereas for a person who has only a bodily concept of 
life and is engaged in sense gratification You always remain covered by 
the curtain of yogamiiyii. Such a person cannot realize that You are very 
near, sitting within his heart. For a nondevotee, You are appreciated only 
as ultimate death. The difference is like the difference between a eat's 
carrying its kittens in its mouth and a eat's carrying a rat in its mouth. In 
the mouth of the cat, the rat feels its death, whereas the kittens in the 
mouth of the cat feel motherly affection. Similarly, You are present to 
everyone, but the nondevotee feels You as ultimate cruel death, whereas 
for a devotee You are the supreme instructor and philosopher. The 
atheist, therefore, understands the presence of God as death, but the 
devotee understands the presence of God always within his heart, takes 
dictation from You, and lives transcendentally, not being affected by the 
contamination of the material world. 
"You are the supreme controller and superintendent of the material 
nature's activities. The atheistic class of men simply observe the activities 
of material nature, but cannot find You as the original background. A 
devotee, however, can immediately see Your hand in every movement of 
material nature. The curtain of yogamiiyii cannot cover the eyes of the 
devotee of Your Lordship, but it can cover the eyes of the nondevotee. 
The nondevotee is unable to see You eye to eye, just as a person whose 
eyes are interrupted by the covering of a cloud cannot see the sun, although 
persons who are flying above the cloud can see the sunshine brilliantly, as 
The Kidnapping of Suhhadra 
235 
it is. My dear Lord, I offer my respectful obeisances unto You. My dear 
self-effulgent Lord, I amY our eternal servitor. Therefore, kindly order me 
-what can I do for You? The conditioned soul feels the pangs of material 
contamination as threefold miseries as long as You are not visible to him. 
And as soon as You are visible by development of Kr§pa consciousness, all 
miseries of material existence simultaneously become vanquished." 
The Supreme Personality of Godhead Kr§pa is naturally very much 
affectionately inclined to His devotees. When He heard Srutadeva 's prayers 
of pure devotion, He was very much pleased and immediately caught his 
hands and began to address Him thus: "My dear Srutadeva, all these great 
sages and saintly persons have been very kind to you by personally coming 
here to see you. You should consider this opportunity to be a great fortune 
for you. They are so kind that they are traveling with Me, and wherever 
they go they immediately make the whole atmosphere as pure as transcen­
dence simply by the touch of the dust of their feet. People are accustomed 
to go to the temples of God. They also visit holy places of pilgrimage, and 
after prolonged association with such activities, for many days by touch 
and by worship, gradually they become purified. But the influence of great 
sages and saintly persons is so great that by seeing them one immediately 
becomes completely purified. 
"Moreover, the very purifying potency of pilgrimages or worship of 
different demigods is also achieved by the grace of saintly persons. A 
pilgrimage site becomes a holy place because of the presence of the 
saintly persons there. My dear Srutadeva, when a person is born as a 
briihmarw, he immediately becomes the best of all human beings. And if 
such a brahmapa, remaining self-satisfied, practices austerities, studies the 
Vedas and engages in My devotional service, as is the duty of the briihmap.a 
-or in other words, if a briihmap.a becomes a Vai§pava-how wonderful 
is his greatness! My feature of four-handed Narayapa is not so pleasing or 
dear to Me as is a briihmana Vaisnava. Briihmana means 'one well con-
. 
. 
. 
. 
versant with Vedic knowledge'; a briihmap.a is the insignia of perfect 
knowledge, and I am the full-fledged manifestation of all gods. The less 
intelligent class of men do not understand Me as the highest knowledge, 
nor do they understand the influence of the briihmap.a Vai§pava. They are 
influenced by the three modes of material nature and thus dare to 
criticize Me and My pure devotees. A briihmar;ta Vai§pava, or a devotee 
already on the brahminical platform, can realize Me within his heart, and 
therefore he definitely concludes that the whole cosmic manifestation and 
its different features are effects of different energies of the Lord. Thus he 
has a clear conception of the whole material nature and the total material 
236 
Kr��a, the Supreme Personality of Godhead 
energy, and in every action such a devotee sees Me only, and nothing else. 
"My dear Srutadeva, you may therefore accept all these great saintly 
persons, briihmarws and sages as My bona fide representatives. By wor­
shiping them faithfully, you will be worshiping Me more diligently. I con­
sider worship of My devotees to be better than direct worship of Me. If 
someone attempts to worship Me directly without worshiping My devotees, 
I do not accept such worship, even though it may be presented with great 
opulence." 
In this way both the briihmar;w, Srutadeva, and the King of Mithila, 
under the direction of the Lord, worshiped both Kr�!la and His followers, 
the great sages and saintly briihmaras, on an equal level of spiritual im­
portance. Both briihmara and King ultimately achieved the supreme goal 
of being transferred to the spiritual worl�. The devotee does not know 
anyone except Lord Kr�!J.a, and Kr�!la is most affectionate to His devotee. 
Lord Krsna remained in Mithila both at the house of the briihmana
Srutade;�. and at the palace of King Bahulasva. And after favoring th�m 
lavishly by His transcendental instructions, He went back to His capital 
city, Dvaraka. 
The instruction we receive from this incident is that King Bahulasva 
and Srutadeva the briihmara were accepted by the Lord on the same level 
because both were pure devotees. This is the real qualification for being 
recognized by the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Because it has become 
the fashion of this age to become falsely proud of having taken birth in the 
family of a k§atriya or of a briihmara, we see persons without any qualifi­
cation other than birth claiming to be briihmara or k§atriya or vaisya. But 
as it is stated in the scriptures, kalau sildra-sambhava: "In this age of 
Kali, everyone is a sudra." This is because there is no performance of the 
purificatory processes known as sarhskiiras, which begin from the time of 
the mother's pregnancy and continue up to the point of the individual's 
death. No one can be classified as a member of a particular caste, especially 
of a higher caste -briihmara, k§atriya or vaisya-simply by birthright. If one 
is not purified by the process of the seed -giving ceremony, or Garb hiidhiina­
sarhskiira, he is immediately classified amongst the sildras, because only 
the sudras do not undergo this purificatory process. Sex life without the 
purificatory process of Kr�!la consciousness is merely the seed-giving process 
of the sudras or the animals. But Krwa consciousness is the highest per­
fection, by which everyone can come to the platform of a Vai�!J.ava. This 
includes having all the qualifications of a briihmara. The V ai�!J.avas are 
trained to become freed from the four kinds of sinful activities-illicit sex, 
indulgence in intoxicants, gambling, and eating animal foodstuffs. No one 
The Kidnapping of Subhadri 
237 
can he on the hrahminical platform without having these preliminary 
qualifications, and without becoming a qualified brahmap.a, one cannot 
become a pure devotee. 
, 
Thus ends the Bhaktivedanta purport of the Second Volume, Thirty­
First Chapter, of Kr�!J.a, "The Kidnapping of Subhadrtitflnd Lord Kr�p.a's 
Visiting Srutadeva and Bahultisva."

32 I Prayers by the Personified Vedas 
King Parik�it inquired from Sukadeva Gosvami about a very important
topic in understanding transcendental subject matter. His question was,
"Since Vedic knowledge generally deals with the subject matter of the
three qualities of the material world, how then can it approach the subject
matter of transcendence, which is beyond the approach of the three 
material modes? Since the mind is material and the vibration of words is a 
material sound, how can the Vedic knowledge, expressing by material 
sound the thoughts of the mind, approach transcendence? Description of 
a subject matter necessitates describing its source of emanation, its quali­
ties and its activities. Such description can be possible only by thinking 
with the material mind and by vibrating material words. Although Brah­
man, or the Absolute Truth, has no material qualities, our power of 
speaking does not go beyond the material qualities. How then can Brah­
man, the Absolute Truth, be described by your words? I do not see how it 
is possible to understand transcendence from such expressions of material 
sound." 
· 
The purpose of King Parik�it's inquiring was to ascertain from Sukadeva
Gosvami whether the Vedas ultimately describe the Absolute Truth as 
impersonal or as personal. Understanding of the Absolute Truth progresses 
in three features-impersonal Brahman, Paramatma localized in everyone's 
heart and, at last, the Supreme Personality of Godhead Kr��a. 
The Vedas deal with three departments of activities. One is called 
karma-kiirz!la, or activities under Vedic injunction which gradually purify 
one to understand his real position; the next is jiiiina-kar4a, the process of 
understanding the Absolute Truth by speculative methods; and the third is 
upiisanii-kiirzl)a, or worship of the Supreme Personality of Godhead and 
sometimes of the demigods also. The worship of the demigods recom­
mended in the Vedas is ordered with the understanding of the demigods' 
238 
Prayers by the Personified Vedas 
239 
relationship to the Personality of Godhead. The Supreme Personality of 
Godhead has many parts and parcels; some are called sviimsas, or His 
personal expansions, and some are called vibhinniimsas, the living entities. 
All such expansions, both sviimsas and vibhinniimsas, are emanations from 
the original Personality of Godhead. Sviimsa expansions are called Vi§{lU­
tattva, whereas the vibhinniimsa expansions are called jiva-tattva. The dif­
ferent demigods are jiva-tattva. The conditioned souls are generally put 
into the activities of the material world for sense gratification; therefore, 
as stated in the Bhagavad-gitii, to regulate those who are very much addict­
ed to different kinds of sense gratification the worship of demigods is 
sometimes recommended. For example, for persons who are very much 
addicted to meat-eating, the Vedic injunction recommends that after 
worshiping the form of the goddess Kali and sacrificing a goat (not any 
other animal) under karma-kiirt)a regulation, the worshipers may be 
allowed to eat meat. The idea is not to encourage one to eat meat, but to 
allow one who is persistent to eat meat under certain restricted conditions. 
Therefore, worship of the demigods is not worship of the Absolute Truth, 
but by worshiping the demigods one gradually comes to accept the 
Supreme Personality of Godhead in an indirect way. This indirect accept­
ance is described in the Bhagavad-gitii as avidhi. Avidhi means not bona 
fide. Since demigod worship is not bona fide, the impersonalists stress 
concentration on the impersonal feature of the Absolute Truth. King 
Parik�it's question .was, which is the ultimate target of Vedic knowledge:­
this concentration on the impersonal feature of the Absolute Truth or 
concentration on the personal feature? After all, both the impersonal and 
personal features of the Supreme Lord are beyond our material concep­
tion. The impersonal feature of the Absolute, the Brahman effulgence, is 
but the rays of the personal body of Kr�!la. These rays of the personal 
body of Kr�!la are cast all over the creation of the Lord, and the portion 
of the effulgence which is covered by the material cloud is called the 
created cosmos of the three material qualities-sattva, rajas and tamas: 
How can persons who are within this clouded portion called the material 
world conceive of the Absolute Truth by the speculative method? 
In answering King Parik�it's question, Sukadeva Gosvami replied that 
the Supreme Personality of Godhead has created the mind, senses and 
living force for the purpose of sense gratification in transmigration from 
one kind of body to another, as well as for the purpose of allowing 
liberation from the material conditions. In other words, the senses, mind 
and living force can be utilized for sense gratification and transmigration 
from one body to another or for the matter of liberation. The Vedic 
240 
Kr��a, the Supreme Personality of Godhead 
injunctions are there just to give the conditioned souls the chance for 
sense gratification under regulative principles, and thereby also give them 
the chance for promotion to the higher conditions of life; ultimately, if 
the consciousness is purified, one comes to his original position and goes 
back home, back to Godhead. 
The living force is intelligent. One therefore has to utilize his intelli­
gence over the mind and the senses. When the mind and senses are purified 
by the proper use of intelligence, then the conditioned soul is liberated; 
otherwise, if the intelligence is not properly utilized in controlling the 
senses and mind, the conditioned soul continues to transmigrate from one 
kind of body to another simply for sense gratification. Another point 
clearly stated in the answer of Sukadeva Gosvami is that the Lord created 
the mind, senses and intelligence of the individual living force. It is not 
stated that the living entities themselves were ever created. Just as the 
shining particles of the sun's rays are always existing along with the sun, 
the living entities exist eternally as parts and parcels of the Supreme 
Personality of Godhead. The conditioned souls, althougJ:l eternally existing 
as part of the Supreme Lord, are sometimes put within the cloud of the 
material concept of life, in the darkness of ignorance. The whole Vedic 
process is to alleviate that darkened condition. Ultimately, when the senses 
and mind of the conditioned being become fully purified, he then comes 
to the original position, called Kr§�a consciousness, and that is liberation. 
In the Vediinta-siltra, the first siltra, or code, questions about the 
Absolute Truth . Athiito brahma-jijiiiisii: What is the nature of the Absolute 
Truth? The next siltra answers that the nature of the Absolute Truth is 
that He is the origin of everything. Whatever we experience, even in this 
material condition of life, is hut an emanation from Him. The Absolute 
Truth created the mind and senses and intelligence. This means that the 
Absolute Truth is not without mind, intelligence and senses. In other 
words, He is not impersonal. The very word "created" means that He has 
transcendental intelligence. For example, when the father begets a child, 
the child has senses because the father also has senses. The child is born 
with hands and legs because the father also has hands and legs. Sometimes 
it is said, therefore, that man is made after the image of God. The Absolute 
Truth is therefore the Supreme Personality, with transcendental mind, 
senses and intelligence. When one's mind, intelligence and senses are puri­
fied of material contamination, one can understand the original feature of 
the Absolute Truth as a person. 
The Vedic process is to gradually promote the conditioned soul from 
the mode of ignorance to the mode of passion and from the mode of 
Prayers by the Personified Vedas 
241 
passion to the mode of goodness. In the mode of goodness there is suffi­
cient light for understanding things as they are. For example, from earth 
a tree grows, and from the wood of the tree, fire is ignited. In that igniting 
process we first of all find the smoke, and the next stage is heat, and then 
fire. When there is actually fire, we can utilize it for various purposes; 
therefore, fire is the ultimate goal. Similarly, in the gross material stage of 
life the quality of ignorance is very much prominent. Dissipation of this 
ignorance takes place in the gradual progress of civilization from the 
barbarian stage to civilized life, and when one comes to the form of 
civilized life, he is said to he in the mode of passion. In the barbarian stage, 
or in the mode of ignorance, the senses are gratified in a very crude 
way, whereas in the mode of passion or in the civilized stage of life, 
the senses are gratified in a polished manner. But when one is pro­
moted to the mode of goodness, one can understand that the senses and 
the mind are only engaged in material activities due to being covered by 
perverted consciousness. When this perverted consciousness is gradually 
transformed into Kr§pa consciousness, then the path of liberation is 
opened. So it is not that one is unable to approach the Absolute Truth by 
the senses and the mind. The conclusion is, rather, that the senses, mind 
and intelligence in the gross stage of contamination cannot appreciate the 
nature of the Absolute Truth, but, when purified, the senses, mind and 
intelligence can understand what the Absolute Truth is. This purifying 
process is called devotional service, or Kr§pa consciousness. 
In the Bhagavad-gita it is clearly stated that the purpose of Vedic know­
ledge is to understand Kr§pa, and Kr§pa is understood by devotional 
service, beginning with the process of surrender. As stated in the Bhagavad­
gita, one has to think of Kr§pa always. One has to render loving service to 
Kr§pa always, and one has to always worship and bow down before Kr§pa. 
By this process only can one enter into the kingdom of God without any 
doubt. 
When one is enlightened in the mode of goodness by the process of 
devotional service, he is freed from the modes of ignorance and passion. 
The word atmane indicates the stage of brahminical qualification in which 
one is allowed to study the Vedic literatures known as the Upani§ads. The 
Upani§ads describe in different ways the transcendental qualities of the 
Supreme Lord. The Absolute Truth, the Supreme Lord, is called nirgup.a. 
That does not mean that He has no qualities. It is only because He has 
qualities that the conditioned living entities can have qualities. The pur­
pose of studying the Upani§ads is to understand the transcendental quality 
of the Absolute Truth, as opposed to the material qualities of ignorance, 
242 
Kf�na, the Supreme Personality of Godhead 
passion and goodness. That is the way of Vedic understanding. Great sages 
like the four Kumaras, headed by Sanaka, followed these principles of 
Vedic knowledge and came gradually from impersonal understanding to 
the platform of personal worship of the Supreme Lord. It is therefore rec­
ommended that we must follow the great personalities. Sukadeva Go­
svami is also one of the great personalities, and his answer to the inquiry 
of Maharaja Parik�it is authorized. One who follows in the footsteps of such 
great personalities surely walks very easily on the path of liberation and 
ultimately goes back to home, back to Godhead. That is the way of per-
fecting this human form of life.

Sukadeva Gosvami continued to speak to Parilqit Maharaja. "My dear 
King," he said, "I will narrate in this regard a nice story. This story is im­
portant because it is in connection with Naraya�a, the Supreme Person­
ality of Godhead. This narration is a conversation between Naraya�a ��i 
and the great sage Narada. Naraya�a J.t�i still resides in Badarikasrama in 
the Himalayan hills and is accepted as an incarnation of Naraya�a. Once 
when Narada, the great devotee and ascetic. amongst the demigods, was 
traveling in different planets, he desired to personally meet the ascetic 
Naraya�a in Badarikasrama and offer him his respects. This great sage in­
carnation of Godhead, Naraya�a ��i, has been undergoing great penances 
and austerities from the very beginning of the creation in order to teach 
the inhabitants of Bharatavar�a how to attain the highest perfectional 
stage of going back to Godhead. His austerities and penances are exem­
plary practices for the human being." 
Badarikasrama is situated in the northernmost part of the Himalayan 
Mountains and is always covered with snow. Religious Indians still go to 
visit this place during the summer season, when the snowfall is not very 
severe. Once, the incarnation of God Naraya�a ��i was sitting amongst 
many devotees in the village known as Kalapagrama. Of course, these were 
not ordinary sages who were sitting with him, and the great sage Narada 
also appeared there. After offering his respects to Naraya�a J.t�i, Narada 
asked him exactly the same question asked by King Parik�it of Sukadeva 
Gosvami. When Narada asked his question of Naraya�a ��i, the ��i also 
answered by following in the footsteps of his predecessors. He narrated a 
story of how the same question had been discussed on the planet known 
as J analoka. J analoka is above the Svargaloka planets, such as the moon, 
Venus, etc. In this planet, great sages and saintly persons live, and they 
were also discussing the same point regarding the understanding of Brah­
man and His real identity. 
The great sage Naraya�a began to speak. "My dear Narada," he said, "I

will tell you a story which took place long, long ago. There was a great 
meeting of the denizens of the heavenly planets. and almost all the 
important brahmaciins, such as the four Kumaras-Sanat, Sanandana, 
Sanaka and Sanatana Kumara-attended. Their discussion was on the 
subject matter of understanding the Absolute Truth, Brahman. You were 
not present at that meeting because you went to see My expansion Ani­
ruddha, who lives on the island of Svetadvipa. In this meeting, all the 
great sages and brahmaciins very elaborately discussed the point about 
which you have asked me, and it was very interesting. The discussion was 
so delicate that even the Vedas were unable to answer the intricate ques­
tions raised. 
Narayana ��i told Naradaji that the same question which Naradaji had 
raised had been discussed in that meeting in J analoka. This is the way of 
understanding through the paramparii, or disciplic succession. Maharaja 
Parik�it was sent to Sukadeva Gosvami; Sukadeva Gosvami referred the 
matter to Narada, who had in the same way questioned Narayana ��i, who 
had put the matter to still higher authorities in the planet of Janaloka, 
where it was discussed among the great Kumaras-Sanat, Sanatana, Sanaka 
Kumara and Sanandana. These four brahmaciiris are recognized scholars 
in the Vedas and siistras. Their unlimited volumes of knowledge, backed 
by austerities and penances, are exhibited by their sublime, ideal character. 
They are very amiable and gentle in behavior, and for them there is no 
distinction between friends, well-wishers and enemies. Being transcenden­
tally situated, such personalities as the Kumaras are above all material 
considerations and are always neutral in respect to material dualities. In 
the discussions held among the four brothers, one of them, namely 
Sanandana, was selected to speak, and the other brothers became the 
audience to hear him. 
Sanandana said, "After the dissolution of the whole cosmic manifesta­
tion, the entire energy and the whole creation in its nucleus form enters 
into the body of Garbhodakasayi Vi�pu. The Lord at that time remains 
asleep for a long, long time, and where there is again necessity of creation, 
the Vedas personified assemble around the Lord and begin to glorify Him, 
describing His wonderful transcendental pastimes. It is exactly like a king: 
when he is asleep in the morning, the appointed reciters come around his 
bedroom and begin to sing of his chivalrous activities, and while hearing 
of his glorious activities, the king gradually awakens. 
"The Vedic reciters or the personified Vedas sing thus: '0 unconquer­
able, You are the Supreme Personality. No one is equal to You or greater 
than You. No one can be more glorious in His activities. All glories unto 
244 
Kf�l).a, the Supreme Personality of Godhead 
You! All glories unto You! By Your own transcendental nature You fully 
possess all six opulences. As such, You are able to deliver all conditioned 
souls from the clutches of miiyii. 0 Lord, we fervently pray that You 
kindly do so. All the living entities, being Your parts and parcels, are 
naturally joyful, eternal and full of knowledge, but due to their own 
faults they try to imitate You by trying to become the supreme enjoyer; 
thus they disobey Your supremacy and become offenders. And because 
of their offenses, Your material energy has taken charge of them; thus, 
their transcendental qualities of joyfulness, bliss and wisdom have been 
covered by the clouds of the three material qualities. This cosmic mani­
festation, made of the three material qualities, is just like a prison house 
for the conditioned souls. The conditioned souls are struggling very hard 
to escape from the material bondage, and according to their different 
conditions of life they have been given different types of engagement. But 
all engagements are based on Your knowledge. Pious activities can be 
executed only when inspired by Your mercy. Therefore, without taking 
shelter at Your lotus feet one cannot surpass the influence of material 
energy. Actually, we, as personified Vedic knowledge, are always engaged 
in Your service to help the conditioned soul understand You."' 
This prayer of the Vedas personified illustrates that the Vedas are meant 
for helping the conditioned souls to understand Kf§!la. All the srutis or 
personified Vedas offered glories to the Lord again and again, singing, 
"]aya! ]aya!" This indicates that the Lord is praised for His glories. Of all 
His glories the most important is His causeless mercy upon the conditioned 
souls in reclaiming them from the clutches of mayii. 
There are unlimited numbers of living entities in different varieties of 
bodies, some moving and some standing in one place, and the condi­
tioned life of these living entities is due only to their forgetfulness of their 
eternal relationship with the Supreme Personality of Godhead. When the 
living entity wants to lord it over the material energy by imitating the posi­
tion of Kr�l).a, he is immediately captured by the material energy and, 
according to his desire, is offered a variety of 8,400,000 different kinds of 
bodies. Although undergoing the threefold miseries of material existence, 
the illusioned living entity falsely thinks himself the master of all he sur­
veys. Under the spell of the material energy, which represents the three­
fold material qualities, the living entity is so entangled that it is not at all 
possible for him to become free unless he is graced by the Supreme Lord. 
The living entity cannot conquer the influence of the material modes of 
nature by his own endeavor, but because material nature is working under 
the control of the Supreme Lord, the Lord is beyond its jurisdiction. 
Prayers by the Personified Vedas 
245 
Except for Him, all living entities, beginning from Brahma down to an 
ant, are conquered by the contact of material_ nature. 
Because He possesses in full the six opulences of wealth, strength, fame, 
beauty, knowledge and renunciation, the Lord alone is beyond the spell of 
material nature. Unless the living entity is situated in Kf§!la consciousness, 
he cannot approach the Supreme Personality of Godhead, yet the Lord, 
by His omnipotency, can dictate from within as the Supersoul. In the 
Bhagavad-gitii, the Lord advises, "Whatever you do, do for Me; whatever 
you eat, first of all offer to Me; whatever charity you want to give, first 
give to Me; and whatever austerities and penances you want to perform, 
perform for Me." In this way the karmis are directed to gradually develop 
Krwa consciousness. Similarly, Kr�!la directs the philosophers to approach 
Him gradually by discriminating between Brahman and miiyii. At last 
when one is mature in knowledge, he surrenders unto Kr�!J.a. As Kr�!la 
says in Bhagavad-gitii, "After many, many births, the wise philosopher 
surrenders unto Me." The yogis are also directed to concentrate their 
meditation upon Krwa within the heart, and by such continued process of 
Kr�!la consciousness the yogi can become free from the clutches of material 
energy. But, as is stated in Bhagavad-gitii, because the devotees are en­
gaged in devotional service with love and affection from the very beginning, 
the Lord directs them so that they can approach Him without difficulty or 
deviation. Only by the grace of the Lord can the living entity understand 
the exact position of Brahman, Paramatma and Bhagavan. 
The statements of the personified Vedas give clear evidence that the 
Vedic literature is presented only for understanding Kr�!J.a. It is confirmed 
in the Bhagavad-gitii that through all the Vedas it is Kr�!la alone who has to 
be understood. Kr§!la is always enjoying, either in the material world or in 
the spiritual world; because He is the supreme enjoyer, for Him there is no 
distinction between the material world and spiritual worlds. The material 
world is an impediment for the ordinary living entities because they are 
under its control, but Kr�!J.a, being the controller of the material world, 
has nothing to do with the impediments it offers. Therefore, in different 
parts of the Upani§ads, the Vedas declare: "Brahman is eternal, full of all 
knowledge and all bliss, but the one Supreme Personality of Godhead is 
existing in the heart of every living entity." Because of His all-pervasiveness, 
He is able to enter not only into the hearts of the living entities, but even 
into the atoms also. As the Supersoul, He is the controller of all activities 
of the living entities. He is living within all of them and witnessing their 
actions, allowing them to act according to their desires, and also giving 
them the results of their different activities. He is the living force of all 
246 
Kr��a, the Supreme Personality of Godhead 
things, but still He is transcendental to the material qualities. He is omni­
potent; He is expert in manufacturing everything, and on account of His 
superior, natural knowledge, He can bring everyone under His control. As 
such, He is everyone's master. He is sometimes manifest on the surface of 
the globe, but He is simultaneously within all matter. Desiring to expand 
Himself in multi-forms, He glanced over the material energy, and thus innu­
merable living entities became manifest. Everything is created by His 
superior energy, and everything in His creation appears to be perfectly 
done without deficiency. 
Those who aspire for liberation from this material world must therefore 
worship the Supreme Personality of Godhead, the ultimate cause of all 
causes. He is just like the total mass of earth, from which varieties of 
earthly pots are manufactured: the pots are made of earthly clay, they 
rest on the earth, and after being destroyed, their elements ultimately 
merge back into earth. Although the Personality of Godhead is the 
original cause of all varieties of manifestation, the impersonalists especially 
stress the Vedic statement, sarvam khalv idam brahma: "Everything is 
Brahman." The impersonalists do not take into account the varieties of 
manifestation emanating from the supreme cause of Brahman. They simply 
take into consideration that everything emanates from Brahman and after 
destruction merges into Brahman and that the intermediate stage of 
manifestation is also Brahman. Although the Mayavadis believe that prior 
to its manifestation the cosmos was in Brahman, after creation it remains 
in Brahman and after destruction it merges into Brahman, they do not 
know what Brahman is. This fact is clearly described in the Brahma­
samhitii: 
The living entities, space, time, and the material elements 
like fire, earth, sky, water and mind, constitute the total cosmic manifesta­
tion, known as bhilr bhuva� sva�, which is manifested by Govinda. It 
flourishes on the strength of Govinda and after annihilation enters into and 
is conserved in Govinda. Lord Brahma therefore says, "I worship Lord 
Govinda, the original personality, the cause of all causes." 
The word Brahman indicates the greatest of all and the maintainer of 
everything. The impersonalists are attracted by the greatness of the sky, 
but because of their poor fund of knowledge they are not attracted by the 
greatness of Kr�pa. In our practical life, however, we are attracted by· the 
greatness of a person and not by the greatness of a big mountain. Actually 
the term Brahman can be applie� to Kr�pa only; therefore in the Bhagavad­
gitii Arjuna admitted that Lord Kr�pa is the Parambrahman, or the su­
preme rest of everything. 
Kr�pa is the Supreme Brahman because of His unlimited knowledge, 
Prayers by the Personified Vedas 
247 
unlimited potencies, unlimited strength, unlimited influence, unlimited 
beauty and unlimited renunciation. Therefore the word Brahman can be 
applied to Krwa only. Arjuna affirms that because the impersonal Brah­
man is the effulgence emanating as rays of Kr�tta's transcendental body, 
Kr�tta is the Parambrahman. Everything is resting on Brahman, but 
Brahman itself is resting on Kr�tta. Therefore Krwa is the ultimate 
Brahman or Parambrahman. The material elements are accepted as inferior 
energies of Kr�tta because by their interaction the cosmic manifestation 
takes place, rests on Kr�tta, and after dissolution again enters into the body 
of Kr�tta as His subtle energy. Kr�tta is therefore the cause of both mani­
festation and dissolution. 
Saroarh khalv idarh brahma means everything is Krwa, and that is the 
vision of the mahiibhiigavatas. They see everything in relation to Kr�tta. 
The impersonalists argue that Kr�tta has transformed Himself into many 
and that therefore everything is Kr�tta and worship of everything is wor­
ship of Him. This false argument is answered by Krwa in the Bhagavad­
gitii: although everything is a transformation ofthe energy of Kr�tta, He is 
not present everywhere. He is simultaneously present and not present. By 
His energy He is present everywhere, but as the energetic He is not present 
everywhere. This simultaneous presence and non-presence is inconceivable 
to our present senses. But a clear explanation is given in the beginning of 
the lsopani§ad, in which it is stated that the Supreme Lord is so complete 
that although unlimited energies and their transformations are emanating 
from Kr�tta, Kr�tta's· personality is not in the least bit transformed. There­
fore, since Kr�tta is the cause of all causes, intelligent persons should take 
shelter of His lotus feet. 
Kr�tta advises everyone just to surrender unto Him alone, and that is the 
way of Vedic instruction. Since Kr�tta is the cause of all causes, He is 
worshiped by all kinds of sages and saints by observance of the regulative 
principles. When there is a necessity for meditation, great personalities 
meditate on the transcendental form of Kr�tta within the heart. In this 
way the minds of great personalities are always engaged in KHtta. With
minds engaged in Kr�tta, naturally the captivated devotees simply 
·
talk of 
Kr�tta. 
Talking of Kr�tta or singing of Kr�tta is called kirtana. Lord Caitanya 
also recommends kirtaniya� sadii har*, which means always thinking and 
talking of Kr�tta and nothing else. That is called Kr�tta consciousness. 
Kr�tta consciousness is so sublime that anyone who takes to this process is 
elevated to the highest perfection of life-far, far beyond the concept of 
liberation. In the Bhagavad-gitii, therefore, Kr�tta advises everyone to 
248 
Kr�!la, the Supreme Personality of Godhead 
always think of Him, render devotional service to Him, worship Him and 
offer obeisances to Him. In this way a devotee becomes fully Kr�!la-ized 
and, being always situated in Kr�!la consciousness, ultimately goes back to 
Krsna . 
. 
. 
. 
Although the Vedas have recommended worship of different demigods 
as different parts and parcels of Kr�!la, it is to be understood that such 
instructions are meant for the less intelligent class of men, who are still 
attracted by material sense enjoyment. But the person who actually wants 
perfect fulfillment of the mission of human life should simply worship 
Lord Kr�!la, and that will simplify the matter and completely guarantee 
the success of his human life. Although the sky, the water and the land are 
all part and parcel of the material world, when one stands on the solid 
land his position is more secure than when he stands in the sky or the 
water. An intelligent person, therefore, does not stand under the protec­
tion of different demigods, although they are part and parcel of Kr�!la. 
Rather, he stands on the solid ground of Kr�!la consciousness. That makes 
his position sound and secure. 
Impersonalists sometimes give the example that if one stands on a stone 
or a piece of wood, one certainly stands on the surface of the land, be­
cause the stone and wood are both resting on the surface of the earth. But 
it may be replied that if one stands directly on the surface of the earth, he 
is more secure than on the wood or stone which are resting on the earth. 
In other words, taking shelter of Paramatma or taking shelter of imper­
sonal Brahman is not as secure a course as taking direct shelter of Kr�!la in 
Kr�!la consciousness. The position of the jiiiinis and yogis is therefore not 
as secure as the position of the devotees of Kr�!la. Lord Kr�!la has there­
fore advised in theBhagavad-gitii that only a person who has lost his senses 
takes to the worship of demigods. And regarding persons who are attached 
to the impersonal Brahman, the Srimad-Bhiigavatam says, "My dear Lord, 
those who are thinking of themselves as liberated by mental speculation 
are not yet purified of the contamination of material nature because of 
their inability to find the shelter of Your lotus feet. Although they rise 
to the transcendental situation of existence in impersonal Brahman, they 
certainly fall from that exalted position because they have neglected to 
desire Your lotus feet." Lord Kr�!la therefore advises that the worshipers 
of the demigods are not very intelligent persons because they derive only 
temporary, exhaustible results. Their endeavors are those of less intelligent 
men. But the Lord assures that His devotee has no fear of falling. 
The personified Vedas continued to pray: "Dear Lord, considering all 
points of view, if one has to worship someone superior to him, then just 
Prayers by the Personified Vedas 
249 
out of good behavior one should stick to the worship of Your lotus feet 
because You are the ultimate controller of creation, maintenance and 
dissolution. You are the controller of the three worlds, Bhiir, Bhuvar and 
Svar, You are the controller of the fourteen upper and lower worlds, and 
You are the controller of the three material qualities. Demigods and persons 
advanced in spiritual knowledge are always engaged in hearing and chanting 
about Your transcendental pastimes because this has the specific potency 
of nullifying the accumulated results of sinful life. Intelligent persons 
factually take a dip in the ocean of Your nectarean activities and very 
patiently hear of them. Thus they immediately become freed from the 
contamination of the material qualities; they do not have to undergo severe 
penances and austerities for advancement of spiritual life. This chanting 
and hearing of Your transcendental pastimes is the easiest process for self­
realization_ Simply by submissive aural reception of the transcendental 
message, one's heart becomes cleansed of all dirty things. Thus Kr��a 
consciousness becomes fixed in the heart of a devotee. 
"The great authority Bhi�madeva has also given the opinion that this 
process of chanting and hearing about the Supreme Personality of Godhead 
is the essence of all Vedic rituaiistic performances. Dear Lord, the devotee 
who wants to elevate himself simply by this process of devotional activities, 
especially by hearing and chanting, very soon comes out of the clutches of 
the dualities of material existence. By this simple process of penance and 
austerity the Supersoul within the devotee's heart becomes very pleased 
and gives the devotee directions so that he may go back to home, back to 
Godhead. It is stated in the Bhagavad-gitii that one who engages all his 
activities and senses in the devotional service of the Lord becomes com­
pletely pacified because the Supersoul is satisfied with him; thus the 
devotee becomes transcendental to all kinds of dualities, such as heat and 
cold, honor and dishonor. Being freed from all dualities, he feels transcen­
dental bliss, and he no longer suffers cares and anxieties due to material 
existence_ Bhagavad-gitii confirms that the devotee who is always absorbed 
in Kr��a consciousness has no anxieties for his maintenance or protection. 
Being constantly absorbed in Kr��a consciousness, he ultimately achieves 
the highest perfection. While in the material existence, he lives very 
peacefully and blissfully without any cares and anxieties, and after quitting 
this body he goes back to home, back to Godhead. The Lord confirms in 
the Bhagavad-gitii, 'My supreme abode is a transcendental place where 
going no one returns to this material world. Anyone who attains the 
supreme perfection, being engaged in My personal devotional service in 
the eternal abode, reaches the highest perfection of human life and doesn't 
250 
Kr��a, the Supreme Personality of Godhead 
have to come back again to the miserable material world.' 
"My dear Lord, it is imperative that the living entities be engaged in 
Kr�tta consciousness, always rendering devotional service by prescribed 
methods such as hearing and chanting and executing Your orders. If a 
person is not engaged in ,Kr�tta consciousness and devotional service, it is
useless for him to exhibit the symptoms of life. Generally it is accepted 
that if a person is breathing he is alive. But a person without Kr�tta 
consciousness may be compared to a bellows in a blacksmith's shop. The 
big bellows is a bag of skin which exhales and inhales air, and a human 
being who is simply living within the bag of skin and bones without taking 
to Kr�tta consciousness and loving devotional service is no better than the 
bellows. Similarly, a nondevotee's long duration of life is compared to the 
long existence of a tree, his voracious eating capacity is compared to the 
. eating of dogs and hogs, and his enjoyment in sex life is compared to that 
of hogs and goats. 
"The cosmic manifestation has been possible because of the entrance of 
the Supreme Personality of Godhead as Maha-Vi�ttu within this material 
world. The total material energy becomes agitated by ·the glance o'f Maha­
Vi�tJ-u, and only then does the interaction of the three material qualities 
begin. Therefore it should be concluded that whatever material facilities 
we are trying to enjoy are available only due to the mercy of the Supreme 
Personality of Godhead. 
· "Within the body there are five different departments of existence, 
known as annamaya, priir-amaya, manomaya, vijiiiinamaya, and at last 
iinandamaya. In the beginning of life, every living entity is food conscious. 
A child or an animal is satisfied only by getting nice food. This stage of 
consciousness, in which the goal is to eat sumptuously, is called annamaya. 
Anna means food. After this one lives in the consciousness of being alive. 
If one can continue his life without being attacked or destroyed, one 
thinks himself happy. This stage is called priir-amaya, or consciousness of 
one's existence. After this stage, when one is situated on the mental 
platform, that consciousness is called manomaya. The material civilization 
is primarily situated in these three stages, annamaya, priir-amaya and 
manomaya. The first concern of civilized persons is economic develop­
ment, the next concern is defense against being annihilated, and the next 
consciousness is mental speculation, the philosophical approach to the 
values of life. 
"If by the evolutionary process of philosophical life one happens to 
reach to the platform of intellectual life and understands that he is not 
this material body, but is a spirit soul, then by evolution of spiritual life he 
Prayers by the Personified Vedas 
251 
comes to the understanding of the Supreme Lord or the Supreme Soul. 
When one develops his relationship with Him and executes devotional 
service, that stage of life is called Kr��a consciousness, the iinandamaya 
stage. Anandamaya is the blissful life of knowledge and eternity. As it is 
said in the Vediinta-siltra, iinandamayo 'bhyiisiit. The Supreme Brahman 
and the subordinate Brahman, or the Supreme Personality of Godhead and 
the living entities, are both joyful by nature. As long as the living entities 
are situated in the lower four stages of life, annamaya, priiramaya, mana­
maya and vijniinamaya, they are considered to be in the material condition 
of life, but as soon as one reaches the stage of iinandamaya he becomes a 
liberated soul. This iinandamaya stage is explained in the Bhagavad-gitii as 
the brahma-bhilta stage. There it is said that in the brahrna-bhilta stage of 
life there is no anxiety and no hankering. This stage begins when one 
becomes equally disposed toward all living entities, and it then expands to 
the stage of Kr��a consciousness in which one always hankers to render 
service unto the Supreme Personality of Godhead. This hankering for 
advancement in devotional service is not the same as hankering for sense 
gratification in material existence. In other words, hankering remains in 
spiritual life, but it becomes purified. When our senses are purified, they 
become freed from all material stages, namely annamaya, priirwmaya, 
manomaya and vijniinamaya, and they become situated in the highest 
stage-iinandamaya, or blissful life in Kr��a consciousness. The Mayavadi 
philosophers consider iinandamaya to be the state of being merged in the 
Supreme. To them, iinandamaya means that the Supersoul and the indi­
vidual soul become one. But the real fact is that oneness does not mean 
merging into the Supreme and losing one's own individual existence. 
Merging in the spiritual existence is the living entity's realization of 
qualitative oneness with the Supreme Lord in His eternity and knowledge 
aspects. But the actual iinandamaya (blissful) stage is obtained when 
one is engaged in devotional service. That is confirmed in the Bhagavad-gitii. 
Mad-bhaktirh labhate pariim: the brahma-bhilta iinandamaya stage is 
complete only when there is the exchange of love between the Supreme 
and the subordinate living entities. Unless one comes to this iinandamaya 
stage of life, his breathing is like the breathing of a bellows in a blacksmith's 
shop, his duration of life is like that of a tree, and he is no better than the 
lower animals like the camels, hogs and dogs. 
Undoubtedly the eternal living entity cannot be annihilated at any 
point. But the lower species of life exist in a miserable condition, whereas 
one who is engaged in devotional service of the Supreme Lord is situated 
in the pleasurable or iinandamaya status of life. The different stages 
252 
K.f�l)a, the Supreme Personality of Godhead 
described above are all in relationship with the Supreme Personality of 
Godhead. Although in all circumstances there exist both the Supreme 
Personality of Godhead and the living entities, the difference is that the 
Supreme Personality of Godhead always exists in the iinandamaya stage, 
whereas the subordinate living entities, because of their minute position as 
fragmental portions of the Supreme Lord, are prone to fall to the other 
stages of life. Although in all the stages both the Supreme Lord and the 
living entities exist, the Supreme Personality of Godhead is always tran­
scendental to our concept of life, whether we are in bondage or in 
liberation. The whole cosmic manifestation becomes possible by the grace 
of the Supreme Lord, it exists by the grace of the Supreme Lord, and 
when it is annihilated, it merges into the existence of the Supreme Lord. 
As such, the Supreme Lord is the supreme existence, the cause of all 
causes. Therefore the conclusion is that without development of Kr�:pa 
consciousness, one's life is simply a waste of time. 
Those who are very materialistic and cannot understand the situation 
of the spiritual world cannot understand the abode. of Kr�:pa. For such 
persons, great sages have recommended the yogic process whereby one 
gradually rises from meditation on the adbomen, which is called miiliidhiira 
or marzipiiraka meditation. Miiliidhiira and marzipiiraka are technical terms 
which refer to the intestines within the abdomen. Grossly materialistic 
persons think that economic development is of foremost importance 
because they are under the impression that a living entity exists only by 
eating. Such grossly materialistic persons forget that although we may eat 
as much as we like, if the food is not digested it produces the troubles of 
indigestion and acidity. Therefore, in itself, eating is not the cause of the 
vital energy of life. For digestion of eatables we have to take shelter of 
another, superior energy, which is mentioned in the Bhagavad-gitii as 
vaisviinara. Lord Kr�:pa says in the Bhagavad-gitii that He helps the digestion 
in the form of vaisviinara. The Supreme Personality of Godhead is all­
pervasive; therefore, His presence as vaisviinara is not extraordinary. 
Krwa is actually present everywhere. The V ai�:pava, therefore, marks 
his body with temples of Vi�:pu: he first marks a tilaka temple on the 
abdomen, then on the chest, then between the collarbones, then on the 
forehead, and gradually he marks the top of the head, the brahma-randhra. 
The thirteen temples of tilaka marked on the body of a Vai�:pava are known 
as follows: On the forehead is the temple of Lord Kesava, on the belly is 
the temple of Lord Naraya:pa, on the chest is the temple of Lord Madhava, 
and on the throat, between the two collarbones, is the temple of Lord 
Govinda. On the right side of the waist is the temple of Lord Viwu, on 
Prayers by the Personified Vedas 
253 
the right arm is the temple of Lord Madhusiidana, and on the right side 
of the collarbone is the temple of Lord Trivikrama. Similarly, on the left 
side of the waist is the temple of Lord Vamanadeva, on the left arm 
is the temple of Sridhara, on the left side of the collarbone is the 
temple of Hr�ike8a, on the upper back the temple is called Padmanabha, 
and on the lower back the temple is called Damodara. On the top of the 
head the temple is called Vasudeva. This is the process of meditation on 
the Lord's situation in the different parts of the body, but for those who 
are not Vai��avas, great sages recommend meditation on the bodily con­
cept of life-meditation on the intestines, on the heart, on the throat, on 
the eyebrows, on the forehead and then on the top of the head. Some of 
the sages in the disciplic succession from the great saint Aru�a meditate on 
the heart because the Supersoul is also staying within the heart along with 
the living entity. This is confirmed in Bhagavad-gitii, Fifteenth Chapter, 
wherein the Lord states, "I am situated in everyone's heart." 
For the Vai��ava, the protection of the body for the service of the Lord 
is a part of devotional service, but those who are gross materialists accept 
the body as the self. They worship the body by the yogic process of medi­
tation on the different bodily parts, such as mapipilraka, dahara and 
hrdaya, gradually rising to the brahma-randhra on the top of the head. 
The first-class yogi who has attained perfection in the practice of the yoga 
system ultimately passes through the brahma-randhra to any one of the 
planets in either the material or spiritual worlds. How a yogi can transfer 
himself to another· planet is very vividly described in the Second Canto of 
S rimad-B hiigavatam. 
In this regard, Sukadeva Gosvami has recomrpended that the beginners 
worship the virata puru§a, the gigantic universal form of the Lord. One 
who cannot believe that the Lord can be worshiped with equal success in 
the Deity or area form, or who cannot concentrate on this form, is advised 
to worship the universal form of the Lord. The lower part of the universe 
is considered the feet and legs of the Lord's universal form, the middle 
part of the universe is considered the navel or abdomen of the Lord, the 
upper planetary systems such as Janaloka and Maharloka are the heart of 
the Lord, and the topmost planetary system, Brahmaloka, is considered 
the top of the Lord's head. There are different processes recommended 
by great sages, according to the position of the worshiper, but the ultimate 
aim of all meditational and yogic processes is to go back home, back to 
Godhead. 
As 
stated 
in 
Bhagavad-gitii, 
anyone 
who 
reaches 
the 
highest planet, the abode of Kr��a, or even the V aiku�tha planets, never 
has to come down again to this miserable material condition of life. 
The Vedic recommendation, therefore, is that one make the lotus feet 
I.
254 
.Kr�tJ.a, the Supreme Personality of Godhead 
of Viwu the target of all one's efforts. Tad virrwlz. paramam padam, Vi�pu­
loka or the Vi�pu planets, are situated above all the material planets. These 
VaikutJ.tha planets are known as saniitana-dhiima, and they are eternal. 
They are never annihilated, not even by the annihilation of this material 
world. The conclusion is that if a human being does not fulfill the mission 
of his life by worshiping the Supreme Lord and does not go back to God­
head, then it is to be understood that he has been frustrated in fulfilling 
the main purpoes of human life. 
The next prayer of the personified Vedas to the Lord concerns His 
entering into different species of life. It is stated in Bhagavad-giHi, Four­
teenth Chapter, that in every species and form of life the spiritual part 
and parcel of the Supreme Lord is present. The Lord Himself claims in the 
Gitii that He is the seed-giving father of all forms and species, and there­
fore they must all be considered sons of the Lord. The entrance of the 
Supreme Lord into everyone's heart as Paramatma sometimes bewilders 
the impersonalists, who think in terms of the equality of the living entities 
with the Supreme Lord. They think that because the Supreme Lord enters 
into different bodies along with the individual soul, there is no distinction 
between the Lord and the individual entities. Their challenge is, "Why 
should individual souls worship the Paramatma or Supersoul?" According 
to them, both the Supersoul and the individual soul are on the same level; 
they are one, without any difference between them. There is a difference, 
however, between the Supersoul and in the individual soul, and this is 
explained in Bhagavad-gitii, Fifteenth Chapter, wherein the Lord says that 
although He is situated with the living entity in the same body, He 
is superior. He is dictating to or giving intelligence to the individual soul 
from within. It is clearly stated in the Gitii that the Lord gives intelligence 
to the individual soul and that both memory and forgetfulness are due to 
the influence of the Supersoul. No one can act independently of the sanc­
tion of the Supersoul. Therefore, the individual soul acts according to his 
past karma, reminded by the Lord. The nature of the individual soul is 
forgetfulness, but the presence of the Lord within the heart reminds him 
of what he wanted to do in his past life. The intelligence of the individual 
soul is exhibited like fire in wood. Although fire is always fire, it is 
exhibited in a size proportionate to the size of the wood. Similarly, 
although the individual soul is qualitatively one with the Supreme Lord, 
he exhibits himself according to the limitations of his present body. 
The Supreme Lord or the Supersoul is said to be eka-rasa. Eka means 
one, and rasa means mellow. The transcendental position of the Supreme 
Lord is that of eternity, bliss and full knowledge. His position of eka-rasa 
Prayers by the Personified Vedas 
255 
does not change in the slightest when He becomes a witness and advisor to 
the individual soul in each individual body. 
The individual soul, beginning from Lord Brahma down to the ant, 
exhibits his spiritual potency according to his present body. The demigods 
are in the same category with the individual souls in the bodies of the 
human beings or in the bodies of lower animals. Intelligent persons, there­
fore, do not worship different demigods, who are simply infinitesimal 
representatives of Kr�!la manifesting in conditioned bodies. The individual 
soul can exhibit his power and potencies only in proportion to the shape 
and constitution of the body. The Supreme Personality of Godhead, how­
ever, can exhibit His full potencies in any shape or form without any 
change. The Mayavadi philosophers' thesis that God and the individual 
soul are one and the same cannot be accepted because the individual soul 
has to develop his power and potencies according to the development of 
different types of bodies. The individual soul in the body of a baby 
cannot show the full power and potency of a grown man, but the Supreme 
Personality of Godhead Kr�!la, even when lying on the lap of His mother 
as a baby, could exhibit His full potency and power by killing Putana and 
other demons who tried to attack Him. Therefore the spiritual potency of 
the Supreme Personality of Godhead is said to be eka-rasa, or without 
change. Therefore the Supreme Personality of Godhead is the only wor­
shipable object, and this is perfectly known to persons who are uncon­
taminated by the force of material nature. In other words, only the liber­
ated souls can worship the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Less intelli­
gent Mayavadis take to the worship of demigods, thinking that the demi­
gods and the Supreme Personality of Godhead are on the same level. 
The personified Vedas continued to offer their obeisances. "Dear Lord," 
they prayed, "after many, many births, those who have actually become 
wise take to the worship of Your lotus feet in complete knowledge." This 
is also confirmed in the Bhagavad-gitii, wherein the Lord says that after 
many, many births, a great soul or mahatma surrenders unto the Lord, 
knowing well that Vasudeva, Krwa, is the cause of all causes. The Vedas 
continued: "As has already been explained, since our mind, intelligence 
and senses have been given to us by God, when these instruments are 
actually purified there is no alternative than to engage them all in the 
devotional service of the Lord. A living entity's entrapment in different 
species of life is due to the misapplication of his mind, intelligence and 
senses in material activities. Various kinds of bodies are awarded as the 
result of a living entity's actions, and they are created by the material 
nature according to the living entity's desire. Because a living entity 
256 
Kr��a, the Supreme Personality of Godhead 
desires and deserves a particular kind of body, it is given to him by the 
material nature under the order of the Supreme Lord. 
In the Srimad-Bhagavatam, Third Canto, it is explained that under the 
control of superior authority a living entity is put within the semina of a 
male and injected into the womb of a particular female in order to develop 
a particular type of body. A living entity utilizes his senses, intelligence, 
mind, etc., in a specific way of his own choosing and thus develops a 
particular type of body within whit;:h he becomes encaged. In this way the 
living entity becomes situated in different species of life, either in a demi­
god, human or animal body, according to different situations and circum­
stances. 
It is explained in the Vedic literatures that the living entities entrapped 
in different species of life are part and parcel of the Supreme Lord. The 
M�y.vadi philosophers mistake the living entity for the Paramatma, who is 
actually sitting with the living entity as a friend. Because the Paramatma, 
the localized aspect of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and the 
individual living entity are both within the body, 
;:t misunderstanding 
sometimes takes place that there is no difference between the two. But 
there is a definite difference between the individual soul and the Super­
soul, and it is explained in the Variiha Puriirw as follows. The Supreme 
Lord has two kinds of parts and parcels: the living entity is called vibhin­
niirhsa, and the Paramatma or the plenary expansion of the Supreme Lord 
is called sviirhsa. The sviirhsa plenary expansion of the Supreme Personality 
is as powerful as the Supreme Personality of Godhead Himself. There is not 
even the slightest difference between the potency of the Supreme Person 
and that of His plenary expansion as Paramatma, but the vibhinniirhsa 
parts and parcels possess only a minute portion of the potencies of the 
Lord. The Niiriiyarw-Paficariitra states that the living entities who are the 
marginal potency of the Supreme Lord are undoubtedly of the same 
quality of spiritual existence as the Lord Himself, but they are prone 
to be tinged with the material qualities. Because he is prone to be 
subjected to the influence of material qualities, the minute living entity is 
called jiva. Sometimes the Supreme Personality of Godhead is also known 
as Siva, the all-auspicious. So the difference between Siva and jiva is that 
the all-auspicious Personality of Godhead is never affected by the material 
qualities, whereas the minute portions of the Supreme Personality of God­
head are prone to be affected by the qualities of material nature. 
The Supersoul within the body of a particular living entity, although a 
plenary portion of the Lord, is worshipable by the individual living entity. 
Great sages have therefore concluded that the process of meditation is 
Prayers by the Personified Vedas 
257 
designed so that the individual living entity may concentrate his attention 
on the lotus feet of the Supersoul form (Vi��u). That is the real form of 
samiidhi. The living entity cannot become liberated from material entan­
glement by his own effort. He must therefore take to the devotional 
service of the lotus feet of the Supreme Lord, or the Supersoul within 
himself. Sridhara Svami, the great commentator on Srimad-Bhiigavatam, 
has composed a nice verse in this regard, the purport of which is as 
follows: "My dear Lord, I am eternally Your part and parcel, but I have 
been entrapped by the material potencies, which are also an emanation 
from You. As the cause of all causes, You have entered my body as the 
Supersoul, and I have the prerogative to enjoy the supreme blissful life of 
knowledge along with You. Therefore, my dear Lord, please order me to 
render You loving service so that I can again be brought to my original 
position of transcendental bliss." 
Great personalities understand that a living entity entangled in this 
material world cannot become freed by his own efforts. With firm faith 
and devotion, such great personalities engage themselves in rendering tran­
scendental loving service to the Lord. That is the verdict of the personified 
Vedas. 
The personified Vedas continued: "Dear Lord, it is very difficult to 
achieve perfect knowledge of the Absolute Truth. Your Lordship is so kind' 
to the fallen souls that You appear in different incarnations and execute 
different activities._ You appear even as a historical personality of this 
material world, and Your pastimes are very nicely described in the 
Vedic literatures. Such pastimes are as attractive as the ocean of tran­
scendental bliss. People in general have a natural inclination to read narra­
tions in which ordinary jivas are glorified, but when they become attracted 
by the Vedic literatures which delineate Your eternal pastimes, they 
actually dip into the ocean of transcendental bliss. As a fatigued man 
feels refreshed by dipping into a reservoir of water, so the conditioned 
soul who is very much disgusted with material activities becomes refreshed 
and forgets all the fatigue of material activities simply by dipping into the 
transcendental ocean of Your pastimes. And eventually he merges in the 
ocean of transcendental bliss. The most intelligent devotees, therefore, do 
not take to any means of self-realization except devotional service and 
constant engagement in the nine different processes of devotional life, 
especially hearing and chanting. When hearing and chanting about Your 
transcendental pastimes, Your devotees do not care even for the transcen­
dental bliss derived from liberation or from merging into the existence of 
the Supreme. Such devotees are not interested even in so-called liberation, 
258 
Kr��a, the Supreme Personality of Godhead 
and certainly they have no interest in material activities for elevation to 
the heavenly planets for sense gratification. Pure devotees seek only the 
association of paramaharhsas, or great liberated devotees, so that they can 
continually hear and chant about Your glories. For this purpose the pure 
devotees are prepared to sacrifice all comforts of life, even giving up the 
material comforts of family life and so-called society, friendship and love. 
Those who have tasted the nectar of devotion by relishing the transcen­
dental vibration of chanting Your glories, Hare Kr§�a, Hare Kr§�a, Kr§�a 
Krsna, Hare Hare/ Hare Rama, Hare Rama, Rama Rama, Hare Hare, do not 
.
.
. 
care for any other spiritual bliss or for material comforts, which appear to 
the pure devotee to be less important than the straw in the street." 
The personified Vedas continued: "Dear Lord, when a person is able to 
purify his mind, senses and intelligence by engaging himself in devotional 
service in full Krsna consciousness, his mind becomes his friend. Otherwise, 
.
.
. 
his mind is always his enemy. When the mind is engaged in devotional 
service of the Lord, it becomes the intimate friend of the living entity 
because the mind can then think of the Supreme Lord always. Your 
Lordship is eternally dear to the living entity, �o when ·the mind is engaged 
in thought of You, one immediately feels the great satisfaction for which 
he has been hankering life after life. When one's mind is thus fixed on the 
lotus feet of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, one does not take to 
any kind of inferior worship or inferior process of self-realization. By 
attempting to worship a demigod or by taking to any other process of 
self-realization, the living entity becomes a victim of the cycle of birth and 
death, and no one can estimate how much the living entity becomes 
degraded by entering the abominable species of life such as the cats and 
dogs." 
Sri Narottama dasa Thakur has sung that persons who do not take to 
devotional service of the Lord but are attracted to the process of philo­
sophical speculation and fruitive activities drink the poisonous results of 
such actions. Such persons are forced to take birth in different species of 
life and are forced to adopt obnoxious practices like meat-eating and 
intoxication. Materialistic persons generally worship the transient material 
body and forget the welfare of the spirit soul within the body. Some take 
shelter of materialistic science to improve bodily comforts, and some take 
to the worship of demigods in order to be promoted to the heavenly 
planets. Their goal in life is to make the material body comfortable while 
forgetting the interest of the spirit soul. Such persons are described in the 
Vedic literature as suicidal because attachment for the material body and 
its comforts forces the living entity to wander through the process of birth 
Prayers by the Personified Vedas 
259 
and death perpetually and suffer the material pangs as a matter of course. 
The human form of life is a chance for one to understand his position, and 
the most intelligent person takes to devotional service just to engage his 
mind, senses and body in the service of the Lord without deviation. 
The personified Vedas continued: "Dear Lord, there are many mystic 
yogis who are very learned and deliberate in achieving the highest per­
fection of life. They engage themselves in the yogic process of controlling 
the life-air within the body. Concentrating the mind upon the form of 
Vi��u and controlling the senses very rigidly, they practice the yoga 
system, but even after much laborious austerity, penance, and regulation, 
they achieve the same destination as persons who are inimical toward You. 
In other words, both the yogis and great, wise philosophical speculators 
ultimately attain the impersonal Brahman effulgence, which. is also auto­
matically attained by the demons who are regular. enemies of the Lord. 
Demons like Kamsa, Sisupala and Dantavakra also attain the Brahman 
effulgence because they constantly meditate upon the Supreme Personality 
of Godhead. Women such as the go pis were attached to Kr��a and capti­
vated by His beauty, and their mental concentration on Krwa was 
provoked by lust. They wanted to be embraced by the arms of Kr��a, 
which resemble the beautiful round shape of a snake. Similarly, there are 
the Vedic hymns, and we also simply concentrate our minds on the lotus 
feet of Your Lordship. Women like the gopis concentrate upon You 
dictated by lust, and we concentrate upon Your lotus feet to go back 
home, back to Godhead. Your enemies also concentrate upon You, think­
ing always how to kill You, and the yogis undertake great penances and 
austerities just to attain Your impersonal effulgence. All these different 
persons, although concentrating their minds in different ways, achieve 
spiritual perfection according to their different perspectives because You 
are equal to all Your devotees." 
. 
Sridhara Svami has composed a nice verse in this regard: "My dear Lord, 
to be engaged always in thinking of Your lotus feet is very difficult. It is 
possible by great devotees who have already achieved love for You and 
who are engaged in transcendental loving service. My dear Lord, I wish 
that my mind also may be engaged somehow or other on Your lotus feet, 
at least for some time." 
The attainment of spiritual perfection by different spiritualists is ex­
plained in the Bhagavad-gitii, wherein the Lord says that He grants the 
perfection the devotee desires in proportion to the devotee's surrender 
unto Him. The impersonalists, yogis and the enemies of the Lord enter 
into the Lord's transcendental effulgence, but the personalists who are 
260 
Kf��a, the Supreme Personality of Godhead 
following in the footsteps of the inhabitants of v rndavana or strictly follow­
ing the path of devotional service are elevated to the personal abode of 
Kf§�a, Goloka Vrndavana, or to the Vaiku�tha planets. Both the imper­
sonalists and the personalists enter into the spiritual realm or the spiritual 
sky, but the impersonalists are given their place in the impersonal Brahman 
effulgence, whereas the personalists are given a position in the V aiku�tha 
planets or in the V rndavana planet, according to their desire to serve the 
Lord in different mellows. 
The personified Vedas stated that persons who are born after the 
creation of this material world cannot understand the existence of the 
Supreme Personality of Godhead by manipulating their material know­
ledge. Just as a person born in a particular family cannot understand the 
position of his great-grandfather who lived before the birth of the recent 
generation, we are unable to understand the Supreme Personality of 
Godhead, Naraya�a or Kr§�a, who exists eternally in the spiritual world. 
In the Eighth Chapter of the Bhagavad-gitii it is clearly said that the 
Supreme Person, who lives eternally in the spiritual kingdom of God 
(saniitana-dhiima), can be approached only by devotional service. 
As for the material creation, Brahma is the first created person. Before 
Brahma there was no living creature within this material world; it was void 
and dark until Brahma was born on the lotus flower sprouted from the 
abdomen of Garbhodakasayi Vi§�U. Garbhodakasayi Viwu is an expansion 
of Kara�odakasayi Vi§�u, Kara�odakasayi Vi§�U is an expansion of San­
kar§a�a, and Sankar§a�a is an expansion of Balarama. Balarama is an 
immediate expansion of Lord Kr§�a. After the creation of Brahma, .the 
two kinds of demigods were born: demigods like the four brothers Sanaka, 
Sanatana, Sananda and Sanat-kumara, who are representatives of renun­
ciation of the world, and demigods like Marici and their descendants who 
are meant to enjoy this material world. From these two kinds of demigods 
were gradually manifested all other living entities, including the human 
beings. Thus any living creature within this material world, including 
Brahma, all the demigods and all the riik§asas, are to be considered 
modern. This means that they were all recently born. Therefore, just as a 
person recently born in a family cannot understand the situation of his 
distant forefather, so anyone within this material world cannot understand 
the position of the Supreme Lord in the spiritual world because the 
material world has only recently been created. Although they have a long 
duration of existence, all the manifestations of the material world, namely, 
the time elements, the living entities, the Vedas, and the gross and subtle 
elements, are all created at some point. Anything manufactured within 
Prayers by the Personified Vedas 
261 
this created situation or accepted as a means to understanding the 
original source of creation is to be considered modern. 
Therefore by the process of self-realization or God realization through 
fruitive activities, philosophical speculation or mystic yoga, one cannot 
actually approach the supreme source of everything. When the creation is 
completely terminated, when there is no existence of the Vedas, no exist­
ence of material time, no existence of the gross and subtle material ele­
ments, and when all the living entities are in the nonmanifested stage resting 
within Naraya!la, then all these manufactured processes become null and 
void and cannot act. Devotional service, however, is eternally going on in the 
eternal spiritual world. Therefore the only factual process of self-realization 
or God realization is devotional service, and if one takes to this process he 
takes to the real process of God realization. Srila Sridhara Svami has 
therefore composed a verse in this regard which conveys the idea that the 
supreme source of everything, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, is so 
great and unlimited that it is not possible for the living entity to understand 
Him by any material acquisition. Everyone should therefore pray to the 
Lord to be engaged in His devotional service eternally, so that by the grace 
of the Lord one can understand the supreme source of creation. The 
supreme source of creation, the Supreme Lord, reveals Himself only to 
the devotees. In the Fourth Chapter of Bhagavad-gitii the Lord says to 
Arjuna, "My dear Arjuna, because you are My devotee and because you are 
My intimate friend I shall therefore reveal to you the process of under­
standing Me." In other words, the supreme source of creation, the Supreme 
Personality of Godhead, cannot be understood by our own endeavor. 
We have to please Him with devotional service, and then He will reveal 
Himself to us. Then we can understand Him to some extent. 
There are different kinds of philosophers who have tried to understand 
the supreme source by their mental speculation. There are generally six 
kinds of mental speculators, and they are called §afl-darsana. All these 
philosophers are impersonalists and are known as Mayavadis. Every one 
of them has tried to establish his own opinion, although they all have 
later compromised and stated that all opinions lead to the same goal and 
that every opinion is therefore valid. According to the prayers of the 
personified Vedas, however, none of them are valid because their process 
of knowledge is created within the temporary material world. They have all 
missed the real point: the Supreme Personality of Godhead or the Absolute 
Truth can be understood only by devotional service. 
One class of philosophers, known as Mimamsakas, represented by sages 
such as Jaimini, have concluded that everyone should be engaged in pious 
262 
Kr��a, the Supreme Personality of Godhead 
activities or prescribed duties and that such activities will lead one to the 
highest perfection. But this is contradicted in the Ninth Chapter of 
Bhagavad-gitii, where Lord Kr��a says that by pious activities one may be 
elevated to the heavenly planets, but as soon as one's accumulation of 
pious activities is used up, one has to leave the enjoyment of a higher 
standard of material prosperity in the heavenly planets and immediately 
come down again to these lower planets, where the duration of life is very 
short and where the standard of material happiness is of a lower grade. The 
exact words used in the Gitii are k§ire purye martya-lokam visanti. There­
fore the conclusion of the Mimamsaka philosophers, that pious activities 
will lead one to the Absolute Truth, is not valid. Although a pure devotee 
is by nature inclined to pious activities, no one can attain the favor of the 
Supreme Personality of Godhead by pious activities alone. Pious activities 
may purify one of the contamination caused by ignorance and passion, 
but this is automatically attained by a devotee who is constantly engaged 
in hearing the transcendental message of Godhead in the form of the 
Bhagavad-gitii, Srimad-Bhiigavatam or similar scriptures. From the Bhagavad­
gitii we understand that even a person who is not up to the. standard 
of pious activities but who is absolutely engaged in devotional service is to 
be considered well situated on the path of spiritual perfection. It is also said 
in the Bhagavad-gitii that a person who is engaged in devotional service 
with love and faith is guided from within by the Supreme Personality of 
Godhead. The Lord Himself as Paramatma, or the spiritual master sitting 
within one's heart, gives the devotee exact direction by which he can 
gradually go back to Godhead. 
The conclusion of the Mimamsaka 
philosophers is not actually the truth which can lead one to real under­
standing. 
Similarly, there are Sankhya philosophers, metaphysicians or material 
scientists who study this cosmic manifestation by their invented scientific 
method and who do not recognize the supreme authority of God as the 
creator of the cosmic manifestation. Rather, they wrongly conclude that 
the reaction of material elements is the original cause of creation. The 
Bhagavad-gitii, however, does not accept this theory. It is clearly said 
therein that behind the cosmic activities is the direction of the Supreme 
Personality of Godhead. This fact is corroborated by the Vedic injunction 
asad vii idam agra iisit, which means that the origin of the creation existed 
before the cosmic manifestation. Therefore, the material elements cannot 
be the cause of material creation. Although the material elements are 
accepted as material causes� the ultimate cause is the Supreme Personality 
of Godhead Himself. The Bhagavad-gitii says, therefore, that material nature 
works under the direction of Kr��a. 
Prayers by the Personified Vedas 
263 
The conclusion of the atheistic Sankhya philosophy is that because the 
effects of the. material worlds are temporary or illusory, the cause is 
therefore also illusory. The Sankhya philosophers are in favor of voidism, 
but the actual fact is that the original cause is the Supreme Personality 
of Godhead and this cosmic manifestation is the temporary manifestation 
of His material energy. When this temporary manifestation is annihilated, 
its cause, the eternal existence of the spiritual world, continues as it is, 
and therefore the spiritual world is called saniitana-dhiima, the eternal 
abode. The conclusion of the Sankhya philosopher is therefore not valid. 
Then there are the philosophers headed by Gautama and Ka�ada. 
They have very minutely studied the cause and effect of the material 
elements and have ultimately come to the conclusion that atomic combina­
tion is the original cause of creation. Present material scientists also follow 
in the footsteps of Gautama and Ka�ada, who propounded this theory 
of paramiinuviida. This theory, however, cannot be supported because the 
original cause of everything is not inert atoms. This is confirmed in 
Bhagavad-gitii and Srimad-Bhiigavatam as well as in the Vedas, wherein 
it is stated eko niiriiyarw iisit, only Naraya�a existed before the creation. 
The Srimad-Bhiigavatam and Vediinta-siitra also say that the original cause 
is sentient and both indirectly and directly cognizant of everything within 
this creation. In the Bhagavad-gitii Kr��a says, aham sarvasya prabhava[i: 
"I am the original cause of everything," and matta� sarvam pravartate: 
"From Me everythi�g comes into existence.�' Therefore, atoms may form 
the basic combinatiQns of material existence, but these atoms are generated 
from the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Thus the philosophy of 
Gautama and Ka�ada cannot be supported. 
Similarly, impersonalists headed by A�tavakra and later on by Sankar­
acarya accept the impersonal Brahman effulgence as the cause of every­
thing. According to their theory, the material manifestation is temporary 
and unreal, whereas the impersonal Brahman effulgence is reality. But this 
theory cannot be supported either, because the Lord Himself says in the 
Bhagavad-gitii that this Brahman effulgence is resting on His personality. 
It is also confirmed in the Brahma-samhitii that the Brahman effulgence 
is the personal bodily rays of Kr��a. As such, impersonal Brahman cannot 
be the original cause of the cosmic manifestation. The original cause is the 
all-perfect sentient Personality of Godhead, Govinda. 
� 
The most dangerous theory of the impersonalists is that when God comes 
as an incarnation He accepts a material body created by the three modes of 
material nature. This Mayavadi theory has been condemned by Lord 
Caitanya as most offensive. He has said that anyone who accepts 
the transcendental body of the Personality of Godhead to be made of 
264 
Kf�l)a, the Supreme Personality of Godhead 
this material nature commits the greatest offense at the lotus feet of Vi�!lu. 
Similarly, the Bhagavad-gitii also states that only the fools and rascals 
deride the Personality of Godhead when He descends in a human form. 
Lord Kr�!la, Lord Rama and Lord Caitanya actually move within human 
society as human beings. 
The personified Vedas condemn the impersonal conception as a gross 
misrepresentation. In the Brahma-sarhhitii, the body of the Supreme 
Personality of Godhead is described as iinanda-cin-maya-rasa. The Supreme 
Personality of Godhead possesses a spiritual body, not a material body. 
He can enjoy anything through any part of His body, and therefore He is 
omnipotent. The limbs of a material body can perform only a particular 
function, just as hands can hold, but they cannot see or hear. Because the 
body of the Supreme Personality of Godhead is made of iinanda-cin-maya­
rasa or sac-cid-iinanda-vigraha, He can enjoy anything and do everything 
with any of His limbs. Acceptance of the spiritual body of the Lord as 
material is dictated by the tendency to make the Supreme Personality of 
Godhead equal to the conditioned soul. The conditioned soul has a material
body. Therefore, if God also has a material body, th�n the impers
.
onalistic 
theory that the Supreme Personality of Godhead and the living entities are 
one and the same can be very easily propagandized. 
· 
Factually, when the Supreme Personality of Godhead comes He exhibits 
different pastimes, and yet there is no difference between His childish body 
when He is lying on the lap of His mother Y asoda and His so-called grown 
up body fighting with the demons. In His childhood bt>dy also, He fought 
with demons such as Piitana, Tr!lavarta; Aghasura, etc., with strength 
equal to that with which He fought in His youth against demons like 
Dantavakra, Sisupala and others. In material life, as soon as a conditioned 
soul changes his body, he forgets everything of his past body, but from the 
Bhagavad�gitii we understand that Kr�!la, because He has a sac-cid-iinanda 
body, did not forget instructing the sun-god about the Bhagavad-gitii 
millions of years ago. The Lord is therefore known as Puru�ottama 
because He is transcendental to both material and spiritual existence. That 
He is the cause of all causes means that He is the cause of the spiritual 
world and of the material world as well. The. Supreme Personality of 
Godhead is omnipotent and omniscient. Therefore, because a material 
body can be neither omnipotent nor omniscient, the Lord's body surely is 
not material. The Mayavadi theory that the Personality of Godhead comes 
within this material world with a material body cannot be supported by 
any means. 
It can be concluded that all the theories of the material philosophers 
are generated from the temporary illusory existence, like the conclusions 
Prayers by the Personified Vedas

in a dream. Such conclusions certainly cannot lead us to the Absolute 
Truth. The Absolute Truth can only be realized through devotional service. 
As the Lord says in the Bhagavad-gitii, bhaktyii miim abhijiiniiti, "Only by 
devotional service can one understand Me." Srila Sridhara Svami has 
composed a nice verse in this regard, which states: "My dear Lord, let 
others be engaged in false argument and dry speculation, theorizing upon 
their great philosophical theses. Let them loiter in the darkness of ignorance 
and illusion, falsely enjoying as if very learned scholars, although they are 
without knowledge of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. As far as 
I am concerned, I wish to be liberated simply by chanting the holy names 
of the all-beautiful Supreme Personality of Godhead-Madhava. Vamana. 
Trinayana, Sankar�apa, Sripati and Govinda. Simply by chanting His 
transcendental names, let me become free from the contamination of this 
material existence." 
In this way the personified Vedas said, "My dear Lord, when a living 
entity, by Your grace only, comes to the right conclusion about Your 
exalted transcendental position, at that time he no longer bothers with the 
different theories manufactured by the mental speculators or so-called 
philosophers. This is a reference to the speculative theories of Gautama, 
Ka!lada, Patafijali and Kapila (Nirisvara). There are actually two Kapilas: 
one Kapila, the son of Kardama Muni, is an incarnation of God, and the 
other is an atheist of the modern age. The atheistic Kapila is often 
misrepresented to be the Supreme Personality of Godhead who appeared 
as the son of Kardama Muni during the time of Svayambhuva Manu. 
Lord Kapila, the incarnation of Godhead, appeared long long ago; the 
modern age is the age of Vaivasvata Manu, whereas He appeared during 
the time of Svayambhuva Manu. 
According to Mayavadi philosophy, this manifested world or the material 
world is mithyii or miiyii, false. Their preaching principle is brahma-satya 
jagat-mithyii. According to them, only the Brahman effulgence is true, 
and the cosmic manifestation is illusory or false. But according to V ai�!lava 
philosophy, this cosmic manifestation is caused by the Supreme Personality 
of Godhead. In the Bhagavad-gitii the Lord says that He enters within this 
material world by one of His plenary portions, and thus the creation takes 
place. From the Vedas also, we can understand that this asat or temporary 
cosmic manifestation is also an emanation from the Supreme sat or fact. 
From the Vediinta-siitra also it is understood that everything has emanated 
from the Supreme Brahman. As such the Vai�pavas do not take this cosmic 
manifestation to be false. The V ai�!lava philosopher sees everything in this 
material world in relationship with the Supreme Lord. 
266 
Kr��a, the Supreme Personality of Godhead 
This conception of the material world is very nicely explained by 
Srila Riipa Gosvami, who said that renunciation of this material world as 
illusory or false without knowledge that the material world is also the 
manifestation of the Supreme Lord is of no practical value. The V ai�!lavas, 
however, are free of attachment to this world because generally the material 
world is accepted as an object of sense gratification. The V ai�!lavas are not 
in favor of sense gratification; therefore, they are not attached to material 
activities. The V ai�!J.ava accepts this material world according to the 
regulative principles of the Vedic injunctions. Since the Supreme Person­
ality of Godhead is the original cause of everything, the V ai�pava sees 
everything in relationship with Kr�!la, even in this material world. By such 
advanced knowledge, everything becomes spiritualized. In other words, 
everything in the material world is already spiritual, but due to our lack 
of knowledge we see things as material. 
The personified Vedas presented the example that those who are seek­
ing after gold do not reject gold earrings, gold bangles or anything else 
made of gold simply because they are shaped differently from the o"riginal 
-�old. All living entities are part and parcel of the Supreme Lord and are 
qualitatively one, but they are now differently shaped in 8,400,000 species 
of life, just like many different ornaments which have been manufactured 
from the same source of gold. As one who is interested in gold accepts all 
the differently shaped gold ornaments, so a V ai�!lava, knowing well that 
all living entities are of the same quality as the Supreme Personality of 
Godhead, accepts all living entities as eternal servants of God. As a 
V ai�!lava, then, one has ample opportunity to serve the Supreme Person­
ality of Godhead simply by reclaiming these conditioned, misled living 
entities, training them in Kr�!la consciousness and leading them back to 
home, back to Godhead. The fact is that the minds of the living entities 
are now agitated by the three material qualities, and the living entities are 
therefore transmigrating, as if in dreams, from one body to another. When 
their consciousness is changed into Kr�!la consciousness, however, they 
immediately fix Kr�!la within their hearts, and thus their path for liberation 
becomes clear. 
In all the Vedas the Supreme Personality of Godhead and the living 
entities are stated to be of the same quality-caitanya, or spiritual. This 
is also confirmed in the Padma Purif!w, wherein it is said that there are 
two kinds of spiritual entities; one is called the jiva, and the other is called 
the Supreme Lord. Beginning from Lord Brahma down to the ant, all 
living entities are jivas, whereas the Lord is the Supreme four-handed Vi�pu 
or Janaradana. The worH iitmii can be applied only to the Supreme Person-

267 
ality of Godhead, but because the living entities are His parts and parcels, 
sometimes the word iitmii is applied to them also. The living entities are 
therefore called jiviitmii, and the Supreme Lord is called Paramiitmii. Both 
the Paramiitmii and jiviitmii are within this material world, and therefore 
this material has a purpose other than sense gratification. The conception 
of a life of sense gratification is illusion, but the conception of service by 
the jiviitmii to the Paramiitmii, even in this material world, is not at all 
illusory. A Kf�l)a conscious person is fully aware of this fact, and thus he 
does not take this material world to be false, but acts in the reality of tran­
scendental service. The devotee therefore sees everything in this material 
world as an opportunity to serve the Lord. He does not reject anything as 
material, but dovetails everything in the service of the Lord. Thus a devotee 
is always in the transcendental position, and everything that he uses 
becomes spiritually purified by being used in the service of the Lord. 
Sridhara Svami has composed a nice verse in this regard: "I worship the 
Supreme Personality of Godhead who is always manifested as reality even 
within this material world, which is considered by some to be false." The 
conception of the falsity of this material world is due to lack of knowledge, 
but a person advanced in Krwa consciousness sees the Supreme Person­
ality of Godhead in everything. This is actually realization of the Vedic 
aphorism, sarvarh khalv idarh brahma: "Everything is Brahman." 
The personified Vedas continued: "Dear Lord, less intelligent men take 
to other ways of self-realization, but actually there is no chance to become 
purified from material contamination or to stop the repeated cycle of 
birth and death unless one is a thoroughly pure devotee. Our dear Lord, 
everything is resting on Your different potencies; and everyone is supported 
by You, as is stated in the Vedas ( eko bahilniirh yo vidadhiiti kiimiin). 
Therefore Your Lordship is the supporter and maintainer of all living 
entities-demigods, human beings and animals. Everyone is supported 
by You, and You are also situated in everyone's heart. In other words, You 
are the root of the whole creation. Therefore those who are engaged in 
Your devotional service without deviation always worship You. Such 
devotees actually pour water on the root of the universal tree. By devo­
tional service, therefore, one satisfies not only the Personality of Godhead 
but also all others, because everyone is maintained and supported by Him. 
Because he understands the all-pervasive feature of the Supreme Person­
ality of Godhead, a devotee is the most practical philanthropist and al­
truist. Such pure devotees, thoroughly engaged in Kr�l)a consciousness, 
very easily overcome the cycle of birth and death, and they as much as 
jump over the head of death." 
268 
Kr��a, the Supreme Personality of Godhead 
A devotee is never afraid of death or of changing his body; his con­
sciousness is transformed into Kr§!la consciousness, and even if he does 
not go back to Godhead, even if he transmigrates to another material body, 
he has nothing to fear. A vivid example is Bharata Maharaja. Although in 
his next life he became a deer, in the life after that he became completely 
free from all material contamination and was elevated to the kingdom of 
God. The Bhagavad-gitii affirms, therefore, that a devotee is never van­
quished. A devotee's path to the spiritual kingdom, back home, back to 
Godhead, is guaranteed. Even though a devotee slips in one birth, the con­
tinuation of his Kr§!la consciousness elevates him further and further until 
he goes back to Godhead. Not only does a pure devotee purify his own 
personal existence, but whoever becomes his disciple also ultimately be­
comes purified and able to enter the kingdom of God without difficulty. 
Not only can a pure devotee easily surpass death, but by his grace his 
followers also can do so without difficulty. The power of devotional 
service is so great that a pure devotee can electrify another person by his 
transcendental instruction on crossing over the ocean of nescience. 
The instructions of a pure devotee to his disciple are also very simple. 
No one feels any difficulty in following in the footsteps of a pure devotee. 
Anyone who follows in disciplic succession from recognized devotees of 
the Lord, such as Lord Brahma, Lord Siva, the Kumaras, Manu, Kapila, 
King Prahlada, King Janaka, Sukadeva Gosvami, Yamaraja, etc., very 
easily finds the door of liberation open. On the other hand, those who are 
not devotees but are engaged in uncertain processes of self-realization, such 
as jiiiina, yoga and karma, are understood to be still contaminated. Such 
contaminated persons, although apparently advanced in self-realization, 
cannot even liberate themselves, not to speak of others who follow them. 
Such nondevotees are compared to chained animals, for they are not able 
to go beyond the jurisdiction of the formalities of a certain type of faith. 
In the Bhagavad-gitii they are condemned as veda-viidah. They cannot 
understand that the Vedas deal with activities of the material modes of 
nature-goodness, passion and ignorance. 
Lord Kr§!la advised Arjuna that one has to go beyond the jurisdiction 
of the duties prescribed in the Vedas and take to Kr§!la consciousness, 
devotional service. It is said in the Bhagavad-gitii, nistraiguryo bhaviirjuna, 
"My dear Arjuna, just try to become transcendental to the Vedic rituals." 
This transcendental position beyond the Vedic ritualistic performances is 
devotional service. In the Bhagavad-gitii the Lord clearly says that persons 
who are engaged in His devotional service without adulteration are situated 
in Brahman. Actual Brahman realization means Kr§!la consciousness and 
Prayers by the Personified Vedas 
269 
engagement in devotional service. The devotees are therefore real brahma­
ciiris because their activities are always in Kr��a consciousness, devotional 
serVIce. 
The Krwa consciousness movement is therefore a supreme call to all 
kinds of religionists asking them with great authority to join this move­
ment by which one can learn how to love God and thus surpass all formu­
las and formalities of scriptural injunction. A person who cannot overcome 
the jurisdiction of stereotyped religious principles is compared to an 
animal chained up by his master. The purpose of all religion is to under­
stand God and develop one's dormant love of Godhead. If one simply 
sticks to the religious formulas and formalities and does not become 
elevated to the position of love of God, he is considered to be a chained 
animal. In other words, if one is not in Kr��a consciousness, he is not 
eligibl 
for liberation from the contamination of material existence. 
Srila Sridhara Svami has composed a nice verse which says, "Let others 
engage in severe austerities, let others fall to the land from the tops of hills 
and give up their lives, let others travel to many holy places of pilgrimage 
for salvation, or let them be engaged in deep study of philosophy and 
Vedic literatures; let the mystic yogis engage in their meditational service, 
and let the different sects engage in unnecessary arguing as to which is the 
best. But it is a fact that unless one is Kr��a conscious, unless one is 
engaged in devotional service, and unless one has the mercy of the Supreme 
Personality of Godhead, he cannot cross over this material ocean." An 
intelligent person," therefore, gives up all stereotyped ideas and joins the 
Kr��a consciousness movement for factual liberation. 
The personified Vedas continued their prayers. "Our dear Lord, Your 
impersonal feature is explained in the Vedas: You have no hands, but You 
can accept all sacrifices which are offered to You; You have no legs, but 
You can walk more swiftly than anyone. Although You have no eyes, You 
can see whatever happens in the past, present and future. Although You 
have no ears, You can hear everything that is said. Although You have no 
mind, You know everyone and everyone's activities, past, present and 
future, and yet no one knows who You are. You know everyone, but no 
one knows You; therefore, You are the oldest and supreme personality." 
Similarly, in another part of the Vedas it is said, "You have nothing to 
do. You are so perfect in Your knowledge and potency that everything 
becomes manifest simply by Your will. There is no one equal to or greater 
than You, and everyone is acting as Your eternal servant." Thus the 
Vedic statements describe that the Absolute has no legs, no hands, no 
eyes, no ears and no mind, and yet He can act through His potencies and 
270 
.Kf�!la, the Supreme Personality of Godhead 
fulfill the needs of all living entities. As stated in the Bhagavad-gita, His 
hands and legs are everywhere; He is all-pervasive. The hands, legs, ears 
and eyes of all living entities are acting and moving by the direction of the 
Supersoul sitting within the living entity's heart. Unless the Supersoul is 
present, it is not possible for the hands and legs to be active. The Supreme 
Personality of Godhead is so great, independent and perfect, however, that 
even without having any eyes, legs and ears, He is not dependent on others 
for His activities. On the contrary, others are dependent on Him for the 
activities of their different sense organs. Unless the living entity is inspired 
and directed by the Supersoul, he cannot act. 
The fact is that ultimately the Absolute Truth is the Supreme Person. 
But because He is acting through His different potencies which are impos­
sible for the gross materialists to see, the ·materialists accept Him as 
impersonal. For example, one can observe the personal artistic work in a 
painting of a flower, and one can understand that the color adjustment, 
the shape, etc., have demanded the minute attention of the artist. The 
artist's work is clearly exhibited in a painting of different blooming 
flowers. But the gross materialist, without seeing the hand of God in such 
artistic manifestations as the actual flowers blooming in nature, concludes 
that the Absolute Truth is impersonal. Actually, the Absolute is personal, 
but He is independent. He does not require to personally take a brush and 
colors to paint the flowers, but His potencies are acting so wonderfully 
that it appears as if flowers have come into being without the aid of an. 
artist. The impersonal view of the Absolute Truth is accepted by less 
intelligent men because unless one is engaged in the service of the Lord, 
he cannot understand how the Supreme is acting-he cannot even know 
His name. Everything about His activities and personal features is revealed 
to the devotee only through his loving service attitude. 
In the Bhagavad-gita it is clearly said, bhokturarh yajiia tapasiim: the 
Lord is the enjoyer of all kinds of sacrifices and of the results of all 
austerities. Then again the Lord says, sarva-loka-mahesvaram: "I am the 
proprietor of all planets." So that is the position of the Supreme Per­
sonality of Godhead. Although He is present in Vrndavana and enjoys 
transcendental pleasure in the company of His eternal associates, the go pis 
and the cowherd boys, His potencies are acting under His direction all over 
the creation. They do not disturb His eternal pastimes. 
Through devotional service only can one understand how the Supreme 
Personality of Godhead, by His inconceivable potencies, simultaneously 
acts impersonally and as a person, He is acting just like the supreme

emperor, and many thousands of kings and chiefs are working under Him. 
The Supreme Personality of Godhead is the supreme independent control­
ling person, and all the demigods-including Lord Brahma, Lord Siva, 
Indra the king of heaven, the king of the moon planet, and the king of the 
sun planet-are working under His direction. It is confirmed in the Vedas 
that the sun is shining, the air is blowing, and fire is distributing heat out 
of fear of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. The material nature is 
producing all kinds of movable and immovable objects within the material 
world, but none of them can independently act or create without the 
direction of the Supreme Lord. All of them are acting as tributaries, just 
like subordinate kings who offer their annual taxes to the emperor. 
The Vedic injunction states that every living entity lives by eating the 
remnants of foodstuffs offered to the Personality of Godhead. In great 
sacrifices the injunction is that Naraya�a should be present as the supreme 
predominating Deity of the sacrifice, and after the sacrifice is performed, 
the remnants of foodstuffs are distributed amongst the demigods. This is 
called yajfia-bhiiga. Every demigod has an allotment of yajfia-bhiiga which 
he accepts as prasiidam. The conclusion is that the demigods are not 
independently powerful; they are posted as different executives under the 
order of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and they are eating 
prasiidam or the remnants of sacrifices. They are executing the order of 
the Supreme Lord exactly according to His plan. The Supreme Personality 
of Godhead is in the background, and His orders are carried out by others. 
It only appears that He is impersonal. In our grossly materialistic way, we 
cannot conceive how the Supreme Person is above the impersonal activities 
of material nature. Therefore the Lord explains in the Bhagavad-gitii that 
there is nothing superior to Himself and that the impersonal Brahman is 
subordinately situated as a manifestation of His personal rays. Sripada Srila 
Sr'idhara Svam'i has therefore composed a nice verse in this regard: "Let 
me offer my respectful obeisances unto the Supreme Personality of God­
head, who has no material senses but through whose direction and will all 
the material senses are working. He is the supreme potency of alfmaterial 
senses or sense organs. He is omnipotent, and He is the supreme performer 
of everything. Therefore He is worshipable by everyone. Unto that Supreme 
Person do I offer my respectful obeisances." 
Kr§�a Himself declares in the Bhagavad-gitii that He is Puru§ottama, 
which means the Supreme Personality. Puru�a means person, and uttama 
means supreme or transcendental. Also in Bhagavad-gitii the Lord declares 
that because He is transcendental to all sentient and insentient beings, He 
272 
Kf��a, the Supreme Personality of Godhead 
is therefore known as the puru§ottama. In another place the �ord says 
that as the air is situated in the all-pervading sky, so everyone is situated 
in Him, and everyone is acting under His direction. 
The Vedas personified continued. "Our dear Lord," they prayed, "You 
are equal to all, with no partiality toward a particular type of living entity. 
As Your parts and parcels, all living entities enjoy or suffer in different 
conditions of life. They are just like the sparks of a fire. Just as sparks 
dance on a blazing fire, so all living entities are dancing on Your support. 
You are providing them with everything they desire, and yet You are not 
responsible for their position of enjoyment or suffering. There are different 
types of living entities-demigods, human beings, animals, trees, birds, 
beasts, germs, worms, insects and aquatics-and all are enjoying or suf­
fering in life by resting on You. The living entities are of two kinds: one 
class is called ever-liberated, nitya-mukta, and the other class is called 
nitya-baddha. The nitya-mukta living entities are in the spiritual kingdom, 
and the nitya-baddha are in the material world. 
"In the spiritual world both the Lord and the living entities are mani­
fest in their original status, like live sparks in a blazing fire. But in the 
material world, although the Lord is all-pervasive in His impersonal feature, 
the living entities have forgotten their Kr�tJ.a consciousness, just as sparks 
sometimes fall from a blazing fire and lose their original brilliant condition. 
Some sparks fall onto dry grass and thus ignite another big fire. This is a 
reference to the pure devotees who take compassion on the poor and 
innocent living entities. The pure devotee enlightens Kr�tJ.a consciousness 
in the hearts of the conditioned souls, and thus the blazing fire of the 
spiritual world becomes manifest even within this material world. Some 
sparks fall onto water; they immediately lose their original brilliance and 
become almost extinct. This is comparable to the living entities who take 
their birth in the midst of gross materialists, in which case their original 
Kr�tla consciousness becomes almost extinct. Some sparks fall to the 
ground and remain midway between the blazing and extinct conditions. 
Thus some living entities are without Kr�tJ.a consciousness, some are 
between having and not having Kr�tla consciousness, and some are actually 
situated in Kr�tla consciousness. The demigods in the higher planets, 
beginning from Lord Brahma, lndra, Candra, the sun-god, the moon-god, 
and various other demigods, are all Kr�tla conscious. Human society is 
between the demigods and the animals, and thus some are more or less 
Kr�tla conscious, and some are completely forgetful of Kr�tJ.a conscious­
ness. The third-grade living entities, namely the animals, beasts, plants, 
trees and aquatics, have completely forgotten Kr�tla consciousness. This 
Prayers by the Personified Vedas 
273 
example stated in the Vedas of the sparks of a blazing fire is very 
appropriate for understanding the condition of different types of living 
entities. But above all other living entities is the Supreme Personality of 
Godhead, Kr§!la or Puru§ottama, who is always liberated from all material 
conditions. 
"The question may he raised as to why the living entities have fallen by 
chance into different conditions of life. To answer this question, we first 
have to understand that there cannot be any influence of chance for the 
living entities; chance is for nonliving entities. According to the Vedic 
literatures, living entities have knowledge, and thus they are called cui­
tanya, which means in knowledge. Their situation in different conditions 
of life, therefore, is not accidental. It is by their choice because they have 
knowledge. In the Bhagavad-gitii the Lord says, 'Give up everything and 
just surrender unto Me.' This process of realizing the Supreme Personality 
of Godhead is open for everyone, but still it is the choice of the particular 
living entity whether to accept or reject this proposal. In the last portion 
of the Bhagavad-gitii, Lord Kr§!la very plainly said to Arjuna, 'My dear 
Arjuna, now I have spoken everything to You. Everything now depends 
on whether you choose to accept it.' Similarly, the living entities who have 
come down to this material world have made their own choice to enjoy this 
material world. It is not that Krwa sent them into this material world. 
The material world is created for the enjoyment of living entities who 
wanted to give up the eternal service of the Lord to become the supreme 
enjoyer themselves. · According to Vai§!lava philosophy, when a living 
entity desires to gratify his senses and forgets the service of the Lord, he is 
given a place in the material world to act freely according to his desire, and 
therefore he creates a condition of life in which he either enjoys or suffers. 
We should know definitely that both the Lord and the living entities are 
eternally cognizant. There is no birth and death for either the Lord or the 
living entities. When creation takes place, it does not mean that the living 
entities are created. The Lord creates this material world to give the 
conditioned souls a chance to elevate themselves to the higher platform of 
Kf§!la consciousness. If the conditioned soul does not take advantage of 
this opportunity, then after the dissolution of this material world, he 
enters into the body of Nadiya!la and remains there in deep sleep until 
the time of another creation. 
"In this connection the example of the rainy season is very appropriate. 
Seasonal rainfall may he taken as the agent for creation because after the 
rainfall the wet fields are favorable for growing different types of vegeta­
tion. Similarly, as se�on as there is creation by the Lord's glancing over the 
274 
Kr��a, the Supreme Personality of Godhead 
material nature, immediately the living entities spring up in their different 
living conditions, just as different types of vegetation grow after a rainfall. 
The rainfall is one, but the creation of the different vegetables is varied. 
The rain falls equally on the whole field, but the different vegetables 
sprout up in different shapes and different forms according to the seeds 
planted. Similarly, the seeds of our desires are varied. Every living entity 
has a different type of desire, and that desire is the seed which causes his 
growth in a certain type of body. This is explained by Riipa Gosvami by 
the word papa-bija. Papa means sinful. All our material desires are to be 
taken as papa-bija, or the seeds of sinful desires. Bhagavad-gita explains 
that our sinful desire is that we do not surrender unto the Supreme Lord. 
The Lord therefore says in Bhagavad-gita, 'I shall give you protection 
from the resultant actions of sinful desires.' These sinful desires are 
manifested in different types of bodies; therefore, no one can accuse the 
Supreme Lord of partiality in His giving one type of body to a certain 
type of living entity and another type of body to another living entity. All 
the bodies of the 8,400,000 species come according to the mental condi­
tion of the individual living entities. The Supreme Personality of God­
head, Puru�ottama, only gives them a chance to act according to their 
desires. Therefore, the living entities are acting, taking advantage of the 
facility given by the Lord. 
"At the same time, they are born from the transcendental body of the 
Lord. This relationship between the Lord and the living entities is ex­
plained in the Vedic literatures, wherein it is said that the Supreme Lord . 
maintains all His children, giving them whatever they want. Similarly, in 
the Bhagavad-gita, the Lord says, 'I am the seed-giving father of all living 
entities.' It is very simple to understand that the father gives birth to the 
children, but the children act according to their own desires. Therefore 
the father is never responsible for the different futures of his children. 
Each child can take advantage of the father's property and instruction, but 
even though the inheritance and instruction may be the same for all the 
children, out of their different desires, each child creates a different life 
and thereby suffers or en.Joys. 
"Similarly, the Bhagavad-gita's instructions are equal for everyone; 
everyone should surrender unto the Supreme Lord, and He will take 
charge of them and protect them from sinful reactions. The facilities of 
living in the creation of the Lord are equally offered to all living entities. 
Whatever there is, either on the land, on water or in the sky, is equally 
given to all living entities. Since they are all sons of the Supreme 
Lord, everyone can enjoy the material facilities given by the Lord, but 
Prayers by the Personified Vedas 
275 
unfortunate living entities create unfavorable conditions of life by fighting 
among themselves. The responsibility for this fighting and creating fa­
vorable and unfavorable situations of life lies with the living entities, not 
with the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Therefore, if the living entities 
take advantage of the Lord's instructions as given in the Bhagavad-gitii and 
develop Kr�!la consciousness, then their lives become sublime, and they 
can go back to Godhead. 
.
"One may argue that because this material world is created by the Lord, 
He is therefore responsible for its condition. Certainly He is indirectly 
responsible for the creation and maintenance of this material world, but 
He is never responsible for the different conditions of the living entities. 
The Lord's creation of this material world is compared to the cloud's 
creation of vegetation. In the rainy season the cloud creates different 
varieties of vegetables. The cloud pours water on the surface of the earth, 
hut it never touches the earth directly. Similarly, the Lord creates this 
material world simply by glancing over the material energy. This is 
confirmed in the Vedas: He threw His glance over the material nature, and 
thus there was creation. In the Bhagavad-gitii it is also confirmed that 
simply by His transcendental glance over the material nature, He creates 
different varieties of entities, both movable and immovable, living and 
dead. 
"The creation of the material world can therefore be taken as one of 
the pastimes of the Lord; it is called one of the pastimes of the Lord 
because He creates this material world whenever He desires. This desire of 
the Supreme Personality of Godhead is also extreme mercy on His part 
because it gives another chance to the conditioned souls to develop their 
original consciousness and thus go back to Godhead. Therefore no one can 
blame the Supreme Lord for creating this material world. 
"From the subject matter under discussion, we can gain a clear under­
standing of the difference between the impersonalists and the personalists. 
The impersonal conception recommends merging in the existence of the 
Supreme, and the voidist philosophy recommends making all material 
varieties void. Both these philosophies are known as Mayavada. Certainly 
the cosmic manifestation comes to a close and becomes void when the 
living entities merge into the body of Naraya!la to rest until another 
creation, and this may be called an impersonal condition, but these 
conditions are never eternal. The cessation of the variegatedness of the 
material world and the merging of the living entities into the body of the 
Supreme are not permanent because the creation will take place again. and 
the living entities who merge into the body of the Supreme without 
276 
Kr��a, the Supreme Personality of Godhead 
having developed their Kr��a consciousness will again appear in this 
material world when there is another creation. The Bhagavad-gitii confirms 
the fact that this material world is created and annihilated. This is going 
on perpetually, and conditioned souls who are without Kr��a conscious­
ness come back again and again whenever the material creation is manifest. 
If such conditioned souls take advantage of this opportunity and develop 
Kr��a consciousness under the direct instruction of the Lord, then they 
are transferred to the spiritual world and do not have to come back again 
to the material creation. It is said, therefore, that the voidists and the 
impersonalists are not very intelligent because they do not take shelter 
under the lotus feet of the Lord. Because they are less intelligent, these 
voidists and impersonalists take to different types of austerities, either to 
attain the stage of nirviirw, which means finishing the material conditions 
of life, or to attain oneness by merging into the body of the Lord. All of 
them again fall down because they neglect the lotus feet of the Lord." 
In the Caitanya-caritiimrta, the author, Kr��adasa Kaviraja Gosvami, 
after studying all the Vedic literature and hearing from all authorities, has 
given his opinion that Kr��a is the only supreme master and that all living 
entities are His eternal servants. His statement is confirmed in the prayers 
by the personified Vedas. The conclusion is, therefore, that everyone is 
under the control of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, everyone is 
serving under the supreme direction of the Lord, and everyone is afraid of 
the Supreme Personality of Godhead. It is out of fear of Him that activities 
are being rightly executed. Everyone's position is to be subordinate to the 
Supreme Lord, yet the Lord has no partiality in His view of the living 
entities. He is just like the unlimited sky; as the sparks of a fire dance in 
the fire, similarly, all living entities are like birds flying in the unlimited sky. 
Some of them are flying very high, some are flying at a lesser altitude, and 
some are flying at a still lesser altitude. The different birds are flying in 
different positions according to their respective abilities to fly, but the 
sky has nothing to do with this ability. In the Bhagavad-gitii also, the Lord 
confirms that He awards different positions to different living entities 
accbrding to their proportionate surrender. This proportionate reward by 
the Personality of Godhead to the living entities is not partiality. There­
fore, in spite of the living entities' being situated in different positions, in 
different spheres, and in different species of life, all of them are always 
under the control of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and yet He is 
never responsible for their different living conditions. It is foolish and 
artificial, therefore, to think oneself equal to the Supreme Lord, and it is 
still more foolish to think that one has not seen God. Everyone is seeing 
Prayers by the Personified Vedas 
277 
God in His different aspects; the only difference is that the theist sees God 
as the Supreme Personality, the most beloved, Kr§:tta, and the atheist sees 
the Absolute Truth as ultimate death. 
The personified Vedas continued to pray. "Our dear Lord, from all 
Vedic information it is understood that You are the supreme controller, 
and all living entities are controlled. Both the Lord and the living entities 
are called nitya, eternal, and so are qualitatively one, yet the singular 
nitya, or the Supreme Lord, is the controller, whereas the plural nityas 
are controlled. The individual controlled living entity resides within the 
body, and the supreme controller, as Supersoul, is also present there, but 
the Supersoul is controlling the individual soul. That is the verdict of the 
Vedas. If the individual soul were not controlled by the Supersoul, then 
how could one explain the Vedic version that a living entity transmigrates 
from one body to another, enjoying and suffering the effects of his past 
deeds? Sometimes he is promoted to a higher standard of life, and some­
times he is degraded to a lower standard of life. Thus the conditioned souls 
are not only under the control of the Supreme Lord, but they are also 
conditioned by the control of the material nature. This relationship of the 
living entities to the Supreme Lord as the controlled and the controller 
definitely proves that although the Supersoul is all-pervasive, the individual 
living entities are never all-pervasive. If the individual souls were all­
pervasive, there would be no question of their being controlled. The theory 
that the Supersoul and the individual soul are equal is therefore a polluted 
conclusion, and no sensible person accepts it; rather, one should try to 
understand the distinctions between the supreme eternal and the subor­
dinate eternals." 
The personified Vedas therefore concluded, "0 Lord, both You and 
the limited dhruvas, the living entities, are eternal. The form of the 
unlimited eternal is sometimes calculated as the universal form, and in the 
Vedic literatures like the Upani§ads, the form of the limited eternal is 
vividly described. It is said therein that the original spiritual form of the 
living entity is one ten-thousandth the size of the tip of a hair. It is stated 
that the spirit is greater than the greatest and smaller than the smallest. 
The individual living entities, who are eternally part and parcel of God, 
are smaller than the smallest. With our material senses, we can perceive 
neither the Supreme, who is greater than the greatest, nor the individual 
soul, who is smaller than the smallest. We have to understand both the 
greatest and the smallest from the authoritative sources of Vedic literature. 
Vedic literature states that the Supersoul is sitting within the body of a 
living entity and is as big as a thumb. Therefore the argument may be put 
278 
Kr�!J.a, the Supreme Personality of Godhead 
forward, how can something the size of a thumb be accommodated within 
the heart of an ant? The answer is that this thumb measurement of the 
Supersoul is imagined in proportion to the body of the living entity. In all 
circumstances, therefore, the Supersoul and the individual living entity 
cannot be taken as one, although both of them enter within the material 
body of a living entity. The Supersoul living within the heart is for 
directing or controlling the individual living entity. Although both are 
dhruva, or eternal, the living entity is always under the direction of the 
Supreme. 
"It may be argued that because the living entities are born of the material 
nature, they are all equal and independent. In the Vedic literature, however, 
it is said that the Supreme Personality of Godhead impregnates the material 
nature with the living entities, and then they come out. Therefore, the 
appearance of the individual living entities is not factually due to material 
nature alone, just as a child produced by a woman is not her independent 
production. A woman is first impregnated by a man, and then a child is 
produced. As such, the child produced by the woman i� part and parcel of 
the man. Similarly, the living entities are apparently produced by the 
material nature, but not independently. It is due to the impregnation of 
material nature by the supreme father that the living entities are present. 
Therefore the argument that the individual living entities are not part and 
parcel of the Supreme cannot stand. For example, the different parts and 
parcels of the body cannot be taken as equal to the whole; rather, the 
whole body is the controller of the different limbs. Similarly, the parts 
and parcels of the supreme whole are always dependent and are always 
controlled by the source of the parts and parcels. It is confirmed in the 
Bhagavad-gitii that the living entities are part and parcel of Kr�!J.a: 
mamaiviimso. No sane man, therefore, will accept the theory that the 
Supersoul and the individual soul are of the same category. They are 
equal in quality, but quantitatively the Supersoul is always the Supreme, 
and the individual soul is always subordinate to the Supersoul. That is the 
conclusion of the Vedas. " 
Two significant words used in this connection are yanmaya and cinmaya. 
In Sanskrit grammar, the word mayat is used in the sense of transformation, 
and also in the sense of sufficiency. The Mayavadi philosophers interpret 
that yanmaya or cinmaya indicates that the living entity is always equal to 
the Supreme. But one has to consider whether this affix, mayat, is used for 
sufficiency or for transformation. The living entity never possesses anything 
exactly in the same proportion as the Supreme Personality of Godhead. 
Therefore, this mayat affix cannot be used to mean that the individual 
Prayers by the Personified Vedas 
279 
living entity is self-sufficient. The individual living entity never has suf­
ficient knowledge; otherwise, how could he have come under the control 
of maya, or the material energy? The word sufficient can be accepted, 
therefore, only in proportion to the magnitude of the living entity. The 
spiritual oneness of the Supreme Lord and the living entities is never to be 
accepted as homogeneity. Each and every living entity is individual. If 
homogenous oneness is accepted, then by the liberation of one individual 
soul, all other individual souls would have been liberated immediately. 
But the fact is that every individual soul is differently enjoying and 
suffering in the material world. 
The word mayat is also used in the sense of transformation, or sometimes 
it is used to mean by-product. The impersonalist theory is that Brahman 
Himself has accepted different types of bodies and that this is His lilii or 
pastime. There are, however, many hundreds and thousands of species of 
life in different standards of living conditions, such as human beings, 
demigods, animals, birds and beasts, and if all of them were expansions of 
the Supreme Absolute Truth, then there would be no question of liberation 
because Brahman is already liberated. Another interpretation put forward 
by the Mayavadis is that in every millennium different types of bodies are 
manifested, and when the millennium is closed, all the different bodies or 
expansions of Brahman automatically become one, ending all different 
manifestations. Then in the next millennium, according to this theory, 
Brahman again expands in different bodily forms. If we accept this theory, 
then Brahman becomes subject to change. But this cannot be accepted. 
From Vediinta-siltra we understand that Brahman is by nature joyful. He 
cannot, therefore, change Himself into a body which is subject to painful 
conditions. Actually, the living entities who are part and parcel of Brahman 
are infinitesimal particles prone to be covered by the illusory energy. As 
explained before, the particles of Brahman are like sparks blissfully dancing 
within a fire, but there is a chance of their falling from the fire to smoke, 
although smoke is another condition of fire. This material world is just 
like smoke, and the spiritual world is just like a blazing fire. The innumerable 
living entities are prone to fall down to the material world from the 
spiritual world when influenced by illusory energy, and it is also possible 
for the living entity to become liberated again when by cultivation of real 
knowledge he becomes completely freed from the contamination of the 
material world. 
The theory of th,e asuras is that the living entities are born of material 
nature, or prakrti, in touch with the puru§a. This theory also cannot be 
accepted because both the material nature and the Supreme Personality 
280 
Kr��a, the Supreme Personality of Godhead 
of Godhead are eternally existing. Neither the material nature nor the 
Supreme Personality of Godhead can be born. The Supreme Lord is known 
as aja, or unborn. Similarly, the material nature is also called ajii. Both 
these terms, aja and ajii, mean unborn. Because both the material nature 
and the Supreme Lord are unborn, it is not possible that they can beget 
the living entities. As water in contact with air sometimes presents 
innumerable bubbles, so a combination of material nature and the Supreme 
Person causes the appearence of the living entities within this material 
world. As bubbles in the water appear in different shapes, similarly the 
living entities also appear in the material world in different shapes and 
conditions, influenced by the modes of material nature. As such, it is not 
improper to conclude that the living entities appearing within this material 
world in different shapes, such as human beings, demigods, animals, birds, 
beasts, etc., all get their respective bodies due to different desires. No one 
can say when such desires were awakened in them, and therefore it is said, 
aniidi-karma: the cause of such material existence is untraceable. No one 
knows when material life began, but it is a fact that it does have a point of 
beginning because originally every living entity is a spiritual spark. As 
sparks falling onto the ground from a fire have a beginning, similarly the liv­
ing entities coming to this material world have a beginning, but no one can 
say when. Even during the time of dissolution, these living entities remain 
merged in the spiritual existence of the Lord, as if in deep sleep, but their 
original desires to lord it over the material nature do not subside. Again, 
when there is cosmic manifestation, they come out to fulfill the same 
desires, and therefore they appear in different species of life. 
This merging into the Supreme at the time of dissolution is compared 
to honey. In the honeycomb, the taste of different flowers and fruits are 
conserved. When one drinks honey, one cannot distinguish what sort of 
honey has been collected from what sort of flower, but the palatable taste 
of the honey presupposes that the honey is not homogenous, but is a 
combination of different tastes. Another example is that although different 
rivers ultimately mix with the water of the sea, that does not mean that 
the individual identities of the rivers are thereby lost. Although the water 
of the Ganges and the Yam una mixes with the water of the sea, the River 
Ganges and River Yamuna still continue to exist independently. The 
merging of different living entities into Brahman at the time of dissolution 
involves the dissolution of different types of bodies, but the living entities, 
along with their different tastes, remain individually submerged in Brahman 
until another manifestation of the material world. As the salty taste of sea 
water and the sweet taste of Ganges water are different, and this difference 
Prayers by the Personified Vedas 
281 
continually exists, so the difference between the Supreme Lord and the 
living entities continually exists, even though it appears that at the time of 
dissolution they merge. The conclusion is, therefore, that even when the 
living entities become free from all contamination of material conditions, 
they merge into the spiritual kingdom, but still their individual tastes in 
relationship with the Supreme Lord continue to exist. 
The personified Vedas continued: "Our dear Lord, it is our conclusion 
that all living entities are attracted by Your material energy, and only due 
to their mistakenly identifying themselves as products of the material 
nature are they transmigrating from one kind of body to another in 
forgetfulness of their eternal relationship with You. Because of ignorance, 
these living entities are misidentifying themselves in different species of 
life, and especially when they are elevated to the human form of life, they 
identify with a particular class of men, or a particular nation or race or so­
called religion, forgetting their real identity as eternal servants of Your 
Lordship. Due to this faulty conception of life, they are undergoing 
repeated birth and death. Out of many millions of them, if one becomes 
intelligent enough, by association with pure devotees, he comes to the 
understanding of Kr§�a consciousness and comes out of the jurisdiction of 
the material misconception." 
In the Caitanya-caritamrta it is confirmed by Lord Caitanya that the 
living entities are wandering within this universe in different species of life, 
but if one of them becomes intelligent enough, by the mercy of the spiri­
tual master and the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Kr§�a, then he 
begins his devotional life in Kr§�a consciousness. It is said, harim vinii 
na mrtim taranti: without the help of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, 
one cannot get out of the clutches of repeated birth and death. In other 
words, only the Supreme Lord, the Personality of Godhead, can relieve 
the conditioned souls from the cycle of repeated birth and death. 
The personified Vedas continued: "The influence of time-past, present 
and future-and the material miseries, such as excessive heat, excessive 
cold, birth, death, old age, disease, are all simply the movement of Your 
eyebrows. Everything is working under Your direction. It is said in the 
Bhagavad-gitii that all material activity is going on under the direction of 
the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Kr§�a. All the conditions of material 
existence are opposing elements for persons who are not surrendered unto 
You. But for those who are surrendered souls and are in full Kr§�a 
consciousness, these things cannot be a source of fearfulness. When Lord . 
Nrsimhadeva appeared, Prahlada Maharaja was never afraid of Him, where­
as his atheist father was immediately faced with death personified and 
282 
.Kf�pa, the Supreme Personality of Godhead 
was killed. Therefore, although Lord Nrsimhadeva appears as death for 
an atheist like Hira�yakasipu, He is always kind and is the reservoir 
of all pleasure to the devotees like Prahlada. A pure devotee is not, 
therefore, afraid of birth, death, old age and disease. 
Sripada Sridhara Svami has composed a nice verse, the purport of which 
is as follows: "My dear Lord, I am a living entity perpetually disturbed by 
the conditions of material existence. I have been cracked into different 
pieces by the smashing wheel of material existence, and because of my 
various sinful activities while existing in this material world, I am burning 
in the blazing fire of material reaction. Somehow or other, my dear Lord, 
I have come to take shelter under Your lotus feet. Please accept me and 
give me protection." Srila Narottama dasa Thakur also prays like this: "My 
dear Lord, 0 son of Nanda Maharaja, associated with the daughter of 
Vr�abhanu, I have come to take shelter under Your lotus feet after 
suffering greatly in the material condition of life, and I am praying that 
You please be merciful upon me. Please do not kick me away; I have no 
other shelter but You." 
The conclusion is that any process of self-realization or God realization 
other than bhakti-yoga, or devotional service, is extremely difficult. 
Taking shelter of devotional service to the Lord in full Kr��a consciousness 
is therefore the only way to become free from the contamination of ma­
terial conditional life, especially in this age. Those who are not in Kr§!la 
consciousness are simply wasting their time, and they have no tangible 
proof of spiritual life. 
It is said by Lord Ramacandra, "I always give confidence and security 
to anyone who surrenders unto Me and decides definitely that He is My 
eternal servant because that is My natural inclination." Similarly, Lord 
Krwa says in the Bhagavad-gitii, "The influence of the material nature is 
insurmountable, but anyone who surrenders unto Me can verily overcome 
the influence of material nature." The devotees are not at all interested in 
arguing with the nondevotees to nullify their theories. Rather than wasting 
their time, they always engage themselves in the transcendental loving 
service of the Lord in full Kr§�a consciousness. 
The personified Vedas continued: 
"Our dear Lord, although great 
mystic yogis may have full control over the elephant of the mind and the 
hurricane of the senses, unless they take shelter of a bona fide spiritual 
master, they fall victims to the material influence and never become 
successful in their attempts at self-realization. Such unguided persons are 
compared to merchants going to sea on a ship without a captain. By his 
personal attempts, therefore, no one can get free from the clutches of 
Prayers by the Personified Vedas 
283 
material nature. One has to accept a bona fide spiritual master and work 
according to his direction. Then it is possible to cross over the nescience 
of material conditions. Sripada Sridhara Svami has composed a nice verse in 
this connection, in which he says, "0 all-merciful spiritual master, repre­
sentative of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, when will my mind be 
completely surrendered unto your lotus feet? At that time, only by your 
mercy, I shall be able to get relief from all obstacles to spiritual life, and I 
shall be situated in blissful life." 
Actually, ecstatic samiidhi or absorption in the Supreme Personality of 
Godhead can be achieved by constant engagement in His service, and this 
constant engagement in devotional service can be performed only when 
one is working under the direction of a bona fide spiritual master. The 
Vedas therefore instruct that in order to know the science of devotional 
service, one has to submit himself unto the bona fide spiritual master. The 
bona fide spiritual master is he who knows the science of devotional 
service in disciplic succession. This disciplic succession is called srotriyam. 
The prime symptom of one who has become a spiritual master in disciplic 
succession is that he is one hundred percent fixed in bhakti-yoga. Some­
times people neglect to accept a spiritual master, and instead they en­
deavor for self-realization by mystic yoga practice, but there are many 
instances of failure, even by great yogis like Visvamitra. Arjuna said in the 
Bhagavad-gitii that controlling the mind is as impractical as stopping the 
blowing of a hurricane. Sometimes the mind is compared to a maddened 
elephant. Without following the direction of a spiritual master one cannot 
control the mind and the senses. In other words, if one practices yoga 
mysticism and does not accept a bona fide spiritual master, he will surely 
fail. He will simply waste his valuable time. The Vedic injunction is that 
no one can have full knowledge without being under the guidance of an 
iiciirya. Aciiryaviin pum§O veda: one who has accepted an iiciirya knows 
what is what. The Absolute Truth cannot be understood by arguments. 
One who has attained the perfect brahminical stage naturally becomes 
renounced; he does not strive for material gain because by spiritual know­
ledge he has come to the conclusion that in this world there is no in­
sufficiency. Everything is sufficiently provided by the Supreme Personality 
of Godhead. A real briihmana, therefore, does not endeavor for material 
perfection; rather, he approaches a bona fide spiritual master to accept 
orders from him. A spiritual master's qualification is that he is brahmani­
§{ham, which means that he has given up all other activities and has
dedicated his life to working only for the Supreme Personality of Godhead, 
Kr§�a. When a bona fide student approaches a bona fide spiritual master, 
284 
Kf�l}-a, the Supreme Personality of Godhead 
he submissively prays to the spiritual master, "My dear Lord, kindly 
accept me as your student and train me in such a way that I will be able 
to give up all other kinds of processes for self-realization and simply 
engage in Kr�tla consciousness, devotional service." 
The devotee engaged by the direction of the spiritual master in the 
transcendental loving service of the Lord contemplates as follows: "My 
dear Lord, You are the reservoir of pleasure. Since You are present, what 
is the use of the transient pleasure derived from society, friendship and 
love? Persons who are unaware of the supreme reservoir of pleasure 
falsely engage in deriving pleasure from sense gratification, but this is 
transient and illusory." In this connection, Vidyapati, a great Vai�tlava 
devotee and poet, says, "My dear Lord, undoubtedly there is some plea­
sure in the midst of society, friendship and love, although it is materially 
conceived, but such pleasure cannot satisfy my heart, which is like a 
desert." In a desert there is need of an ocean of water. But if only a drop 
of water is poured on the desert, what is the value of such water? Similarly, 
our material hearts are full of multi-desires, which eannot be fulfilled 
within the material society of friendship and love. When our hearts begin 
to derive pleasure from the supreme reservoir of pleasure, then we can be 
satisfied. That transcendental satisfaction is only possible in devotional 
service, in full Kr�tla consciousness. 
The personified Vedas continued: "Our dear Lord, You are sac-cid­
iinanda-vigraha, the ever-blissful form of knowledge, and because the living 
entities are parts and parcels of Your personality, their natural state of ex­
istence is to be fully conscious of You. In this material world, anyone who 
has developed such Kr�tla consciousness is no longer interested in the 
materialistic way of life. A Kr�tla conscious being becomes disinterested in 
family life or opulent living conditions, and he requires only a little con­
cession for his bodily needs. In other words, he is no longer interested in 
sense gratification. The perfection of human life is based on knowledge and 
renunciation, but it is very difficult to attempt to reach the stage of know­
ledge and renunciation while in family life. Kr��a conscious persons there­
fore take shelter of the association of devotees or sanctified places of 
pilgrimage. Such persons are aware of the relationship between the Super­
soul and the individual living entities, and they are never in the bodily 
concept of life. Because they always carry You in full consciousness 
within their hearts, they are so purified that any place they go becomes 
a holy place of pilgrimage, and the water which washes their feet is able 
to deliver many sinful persons hovering within this material world." 
When Prahlada Maharaja was asked by his atheistic father to describe 
Prayers by the Personified Vedas 
285 
something very good which he had learned, he replied to his father that 
for a materialistic person who is always full of anxieties due to being 
engaged in temporary and relative truths, the best course is to give up the 
bli�d well of family life and go to the forest to take shelter of the Supreme 
Lord. Those who are actually pure devotees are celebrated as mahiitmiis, 
or great sages, personalities pe�fect in knowledge. They always think of the 
Supreme Lord and His lotus feet, and thus they become automatically 
liberated. Devotees who are always situated in that position become 
electrified by the inconceivable potencies of the Lord, and thus they them­
selves become the source of liberation for their followers and devotees. 
A Kr§-!la conscious person is fully electrified spiritually, and therefore 
anyone who touches or takes shelter of such a pure devotee becomes 
similarly electrified with spiritual potencies. Such devotees are never 
puffed up with material opulences. Generally, the material opulences are 
good parentage, education, beauty and riches, but although a devotee of 
the Lord may possess all four of these material opulences, he is never 
carried away by the pride of possessing such distinctions. Great devotees 
of the Lord travel all over the world from one place of pilgrimage to 
another, and on their way they meet many conditioned souls and deliver 
them by their association and distribution of transcendental knowledge. 
They reside in places like Vrndavana, Mathura, Dvaraka, Jagannatha Puri 
and Navadvipa because only devotees assemble in such places. In this way 
they take advantage of saintly association, and by such association the 
devotees advance more and more in Kr§-!la consciousness. Such advance­
ment is not possible in ordinary household life which is devoid of Kr§-!la 
consciOusness. 
The personified Vedas continue: "Our dear Lord, there are two classes 
of transcendentalists, the impersonalists and the personalists. The opinion 
of the impersonalists is that this material manifestation is false and that 
only the Absolute Truth is factual. The view of the personalist, however, 
is that the material world, although very temporary, is nevertheless not 
false, but is factual. Such transcendentalists have different arguments to 
establish the validity of their philosophies. Factually, the material world 
is simultaneously both truth and untruth. It is truth because everything is 
an expansion of the Supreme Absolute Truth, and it is untruth because the 
existence of the material world is temporary; it is created, and it is 
annihilated. Because of its different conditions of existence, the cosmic 
manifestation has no fixed position. Those who advocate acceptance of 
this material world as false are generally known by the maxim brahma 
satya jagan mithyii. They put forward the argument that everything in the 
286 
Kr�na, the Supreme Personality of Godhead 
material world is prepared from matter. For example, there are many 
things made of clay, such as earthen pots, dishes and bails. After their 
annihilation, these things may become transformed into many other 
material objects, but in all cases, their existence as clay continues. An 
earthen water jug, after being broken, may be transformed into a bowl 
or dish, but either as a dish, bowl or water jug, the earth itself continues 
to exist. Therefore, the forms of a water jug, bowl or dish are false, but 
their existence as earth is real. This is the impersonalists' version. This cos­
mic manifestation is certainly produced from the Absolute Truth, but 
because its existence is temporary, it is therefore false; the impersonalists' 
understanding is that the Absolute Truth, which is always present, is the 
only truth. In the opinion of other transcendentalists, however, this 
material world, being produced of the Absolute Truth, is also truth. The 
impersonalists' counter-argument is that the material world is not factual 
because sometimes it is found that matter is produced from spirit soul, and 
sometimes spirit soul is produced from matter. Such philosophers push for­
ward the argument that although cow dung is dead matter, sometimes it is 
found tnat scorpions come out of cow dung. Similarly, dead matter like 
nails and hair comes out of the living body. Therefore, things produced of 
of a certain thing are not always the same. On the strength of this 
argument, Mayavadi philosophers establish that although this cosmic 
manifestation is certainly an emanation from the Absolute Truth, the 
cosmic manifestation does not necessarily have truth in it. According to 
this view, the Absolute Truth, Brahman, should therefore be accepted as 
truth, whereas the cosmic manifestation, although a product of the Abso­
lute Truth, cannot be taken as truth. 
The view of the Mayavadi philosopher, however, is stated in the 
Bhagavad-gitii to be the view of the asuras, or demons. The Lord says in 
Bhagavad-gitii, asatyam aprati§{ham te jagad iihur anisvaram. The asuras' 
view of this cosmic manifesattion is that the whole creation is false. The 
asuras think that the mere interaction of matter is the source of the 
creation, and there is no controller or God. But actually that is not the 
fact. From the Seventh Chapter of the Bhagavad-gitii, we understand that 
the five gross elements-earth, water, air, fire and sky-plus the subtle 
elements-mind, intelligence and false ego-are the eight separated energies 
of the Supreme Lord. Beyond this inferior material energy, there is a 
spiritual energy, which is known as the living entities. The living entities 
are also accepted as the superior energy of the Lord. The whole cosmic 
manifestation is a combination of the inferior and superior energies, and 
the source of the energies is the Supreme Personality of Godhead. The 
Supreme Personality of Godhead has many different types of energies.

That is confirmed in the Vedas: pariisya saktir vividhaiva srilyate 
the 
transcendental energies of the Lord are variegated, and because such 
varieties have emanated from the Supreme Lord, they cannot be false. The 
Lord is ever-existing, and the energies are ever-existing. Some of the energy 
is temporary-sometimes manifested and sometimes unmanifested-but that 
does not mean that it is false. The example may be given that when a person 
is angry he does things which are different from his normal condition of 
life, but that the mood of anger only appears and disappears does not mean 
that the energy of anger is false. As such, the argument of the Mayavadi 
philosophers that this world is false is not accepted by the V ai�ttava 
philosophers. It is confirmed by the Lord Himself that the view that 
there is no supreme cause of this material manifestation, that there is no 
God, and that everything is only the creation of the interaction of matter 
is a view of the asuras. 
The Mayavadi philosopher sometimes puts forward the argument of the 
snake and the rope. In the dark of evening, a curled up rope is sometimes, 
due to ignorance, taken for a snake. But mistaking the rope as a snake does 
not mean that the rope or the snake is false, and therefore this example, 
used by the Mayavadis to illustrate the falsity of this material world, is not 
valid. When a thing is taken as fact but actually has no existence at all, it 
is called false. But if something is mistaken for something else, that does 
not mean that it is false. The V aiwava philosophers use a very appropriate 
example comparing· this material world to an earthen pot. When we see an 
earthen pot, it does not at once disappear and turn into something else. 
It may be temporary, but the earthen pot is taken into use for bringing 
water, and we continue to see it as an earthen pot. Therefore, although 
the earthen pot is temporary and is different from the original earth, still 
we cannot say that it is false. We should therefore conclude that the 
entire earth and the earthen pot are both truths because one is the 
product of the other. We understand from Bhagavad-gitii that after the 
dissolution of this cosmic manifestation, the energy enters into the 
Supreme Personality of Godhead. The Supreme Personality of Godhead is 
ever-existing with His varied energies. Because the material creation is an 
emanation from Him, we cannot say that this cosmic manifestation is a 
product of something void. ���Ja is not void. Whenever we speak of 
K���Ja, He is present with 
His form, quality, name, entourage and 
paraphernalia. Therefore, K��tta is not impersonal. The original cause of 
everything is neither void nor impersonal, but is the Supreme Person. 
Demons may say that this material creation is anisvara, without a controller 
or God, but such arguments ultimately cannot stand. 
The example given by the Mayavadi philosophers that inanimate matter 
288 
Kr��a, the Supreme Personality of Godhead 
like nails and hair comes out from the living body is not a very sound 
argument. Nails and hair are undoubtedly inanimate, but they come not 
from the animate living being, but from the inanimate material body. 
Similarly, the argument that the scorpion comes from cow dung, meaning 
that a living entity comes from matter, is also not sound. The scorpion 
which comes out of the cow dung is certainly a living entity, but the 
living entity does not come out of the cow dung. Only the living entity's 
material body, or the body of the scorpion, comes out of the cow dung. 
The sparks of the living entity, as we understand from Bhagavad-gitii, are 
impregnated within material nature, and then they come out. The body of 
the living entity in different forms is supplied by material nature, but the 
living entity himself is begotten by the Supreme Lord. The father and the 
mother give the body which is necessary for the living entity under certain 
conditions. The living entity transmigrates from one body to another 
according to his different desires. The desires in the subtle form of 
intelligence, mind and false ego accompany the living entity from body to 
body, and by superior arrangement a living entity is pu_t into the womb of 
a certain type of material body, and then he develops a similar body. 
Therefore, the spirit souris not produced from matter, but it takes on a 
particular type of body under superior arrangement. To our present 
experience, this material world is a combination of matter and spirit. The 
spirit is moving the matter. The spirit soul (the living entity) and matter 
are different energies· of the Supreme Lord. Since both the energies are 
products of the supreme eternal or the supreme truth, they are therefore 
factual; they are not false. Because the living entity is part and parcel of 
the Supreme, he is existing eternally. Therefore, there cannot be any 
question of birth or death. So-called birth and death occur because of the 
material body. The Vedic version sarvarh khalv idarh brahma means that 
since both the energies have emanated from the Supreme Brahman, every­
thing that we experience is not different from Brahman. 
There are many arguments about the existence of this material world, 
but the Vai�ttava philosophical conclusion is the best. The example of the 
earthen pot is very suitable: the form of the earthen pot may be tempo­
rary, but it has a specific purpose. The purpose of the earthen pot is to 
carry water from one place to another. Similarly, this material body, 
although temporary, has a special use. The living entity is given a chance 
from the beginning of the creation to evolve different kinds of material 
bodies according to the reserve desires he has accumulated from time 
immemorial. The human form of body is a special chance in which the 
developed form of consciousness can be utilized.

Sometimes the Mayavadi philosophers push forward the argument that 
if this material world is truth, then why are householders advised to give 
up their connection with this material world and take sannytisa? But the 
Vai§�ava philosopher's view of sannytisa is not that because th� world is 
false, one must therefore give up material activities. The purpose of 
Vai§�ava sannytisa is to utilize things as they are intended. Srila Riipa 
Gosvami has given two formulas for our dealing with this material world. 
When a V ai§�ava renounces this materialistic way of life and takes to 
sannyiisa, it is not on the conception of the falsity of the material world, 
but to devote himself fully to engaging everything in the service of the 
Lord. Srila Riipa Gosvami therefore gives this formula: one should be 
unattached to the material world because material attachment is meaning­
less. The entire material world, the entire cosmic manifestation, belongs to 
God, Kr§I].a. Therefore, everything should be utilized for Kr§I].a, and the 
devotee should remain unattached to material things. This is the purpose 
of Vai§�ava sannytisa. A materialist sticks to the world for sense gratifi­
cation, but a Vai§�ava sannytisi, although not accepting anything for his 
personal sense gratification, knows the art of utilizing everything for the 
service of the Lord. Srila Riipa Gosvami has therefore criticized the 
Mayavadi sann ytisis because they do not know that everything has a 
utilization for the service of the Lord. On the contrary, they take the 
world to be false and thus falsely think of being liberated from the 
contamination of the material world. Since everything is an expansion of 
the energy of the Supreme Lord, the expansions are as real as the Supreme 
Lord is. 
That the cosmic world is only temporarily manifested does not mean 
that it is false or that the source of its manifestation is false. Since the 
source of its manifestation is truth, the manifestation is also truth, but 
one must know how to utilize it. The same example can be cited: the 
temporary earthen pot is produced from the whole earth, but when it is 
utilized for a proper purpose, the earthen pot is not false. The V ai§�ava 
philosophers know how to utilize the temporary construction of this 
material world, just as a sane man knows how to utilize the temporary 
construction of the earthen pot. When the earthen pot is utilized for a 
wrong purpose, that is false. Similarly, this human form of body, or this 
material world, when utilized for false sense gratification, is false. But if 
this human form of body and the material creation are utilized for the 
service of the Supreme Lord, their activities are never false. It is therefore 
confirmed in the Bhagavad-gita that a little service attitude in utilizing 
this body and the material world for the service of the Lord can deliver a 
290 
Kf��a, the Supreme Personality of Godhead 
person from the gravest danger of life. When they are properly utilized, 
neither the superior nor inferior energies emanating from the Supreme 
Personality of Godhead are_ false. As far as fruitive activities are concerned, 
they are mainly based on the platform of sense gratification. Therefore an 
advanced K�§I}-a conscious person does not take to them. The result of 
fruitive activities can elevate one to the higher planetary system, but as it 
is said in the Bhagavad-gitii, foolish persons, after exhausting the results of 
their pious activities in the heavenly kingdom, come back again to this 
lower planetary system and then again try to go to the higher planetary 
system. Their only profit is to take the trouble of going and coming back, 
just as at present many material scientists are spoiling their time by trying 
to go to the moon planet and again come back. Those who are engaged in 
such activities are described by the Vedas personified as andha-paramparii, 
or blind followers of the Vedic ritualistic ceremonies. Although such 
ceremonies are certainly mentioned in the Vedas, they are not meant for 
the intelligent class of men. Men who are too much attached to material 
enjoyment are captivated by the prospect of being elevated to the higher 
planetary systems, and so they take to such ritualistic activities. But a 
person who is intelligent, or who has taken shelter of a bona fide spiritual 
master to see things as they are, does not take to fruitive activities, but 
engages himself in the transcendental loving service of the Lord. 
Persons who are not devotees take to the Vedic ritualistic ceremonies 
for materialistic reasons, and then they are bewildered. A vivid example 
can be given: an intelligent person possessing millions of dollars in currency 
notes does not hold the money without using it, even though he knows 
perfectly well that the currency notes in themselves are nothing but paper. 
When one has one million dollars in currency notes, he is actually holding 
only a huge bunch of papers, but if he utilizes it for a purpose, then he 
benefits. Similarly, although this material world may be false, just like the 
paper, it has its proper beneficial utilization. Because the currency notes, 
although paper, are issued by the government, they therefore have full 
value. Similarly, this material world may be false or temporary, but 
because it is an emanation from the Supreme Lord, it has its full value. 
The Vai§�ava philosopher acknowledges the full value of this material 
world and knows how to properly utilize it, whereas the Mayavadi philoso­
pher, mistaking the currency note for false paper, gives it up and cannot 
utilize the money. Srila Riipa Gosvami therefore declares that if one 
rejects this material world as false, not considering the importance of this 
material world as a means to serve the Supreme Personality of Godhead, 
such renunciation has very little value. A person who knows the intrinsic 
Prayers by the Personified Vedas 
291 
value of this material world for the service of the Lord, who is not attached 
to the material world, and who renounces the material world by not 
accepting it for sense gratification is situated in real renunciation. This 
material world is an expansion of the material energy of the Lord. There­
fore it is real. It is not false, as it is sometimes concluded from the example 
of the snake and the rope. 
The personified Vedas continued: "The cosmic manifestation, because 
of 
the 
flickering 
nature 
of 
its 
impermanent 
existence, 
appears 
to less intelligent men to he false." The Mayavadi philosophers take 
advantage of the flickering nature of this cosmic manifestation to prove 
their thesis that this world is false. According to the Vedic version, before 
the creation this world had no existence, and after dissolution the world 
will no longer by manifested. V oidists also take advantage of this Vedic 
version and conclude that the cause of this material world is void. But 
Vedic injunction does not say that it is void. The Vedic injunction defines 
the source of creation and dissolution as yato vii imani bhiitiini jayante, 
"He from whom this cosmic manifestation has emanated and in whom, 
after annihilation, everything will merge." The same is explained in the 
Vediinta-siitra and in the first verse of the First Chapter of Srimad­
Bhagavatam by the word janmadyasya, He from whom all things emanate. 
All these Vedic injunctions indicate that the cosmic manifestation is due 
to the Supreme Absolute Personality of Godhead, and when it is dissolved 
it merges into Him. The same is confirmed in the Bhagavad-gitii: this 
cosmic manifestation is coming into existence and again dissolving, and 
after dissolution it merges into the existence of the Supreme Lord. This 
statement definitely confirms that the particular energy known as bahi­
ranga-maya, or the external energy, although of flickering nature, is the 
energy of the Supreme Lord, and as such it cannot he false. It simply 
appears to be false. The Mayavadi philosophers conclude that because the 
material nature has no existence in the beginning and is nonexistent after 
dissolution, it is therefore false. But by the example of the earthen pots 
and dishes the Vedic version is presented: although the existence of the 
particular by-products of the Absolute Truth are temporary, the energy 
of the Supreme Lord is permanent. The earthen pot or water jug may be 
broken or transformed into another shape, such as that of a dish or 
or bowl, but the ingredient, or the material basis, namely the earth, 
continues to be the same. The basic principle of this cosmic manifestation 
is always the same, Brahman, or the Absolute Truth; therefore, the 
Mayavadi philosophers' theory that it is false is certainly only mental 
concoction. That the cosmic manifestation is flickering and tempo-
292 
Kr��a, the Supreme Personality of Godhead 
rary dose not mean that it is false. The definition of falsity is that 
which never had any existence but is existing only in name. For instance, 
the eggs of a horse or the flower of the sky or the horn of a rabbit are 
phenomena which exist only in name. There is no horse's eggs, there is no 
rabbit's horn, nor are there flowers growing in the sky. There are many 
things which exist in name or imagination but actually have no factual 
manifestation. Such things can be called false. But the V ai��ava cannot 
take this material world to be false simply because its temporary nature is 
manifesting and again dissolving. 
The personified Vedas continued to say that the Supersoul and the 
individual soul, or Paramatma and jiviitmii, cannot be equal in any 
circumstance, although both of them are sitting within the same body, 
like two birds sitting in the same tree. As declared in the Vedas, these two 
birds, although sitting as friends, are not equal. One is simply a witness. 
This bird is Paramatma, or the Supersoul. And the other bird is eating the 
fruit of the tree. That is jiviitmii. When there is cosmic manifestation, the 
jiviitmii, or the individual soul, appears in the creation in different forms, 
according to his previous fruitive activities, and due to his long forgetfulness 
of real existence, he identifies himself with a particular form awarded to 
him by the laws of material nature. After assuming a material form, he 
becomes subjected to the three material modes of nature and acts accord­
ingly to continue his existence in the material world. While enwrapped in 
such ignorance, his natural opulences, although existing in minute quantity, 
are almost extinct. The opulences of the Supersoul, or the Supreme 
Personality of Godhead, however, are not diminished, although He appears 
within this material world. He maintains all opulences and perfections in 
full and yet keeps Himself apart from all the tribulations of this material 
world. The conditioned soul becomes entrapped in the material world, 
whereas the Supersoul, or the Supreme Personality of Godhead, leaves it 
without affection, just as a snake sheds his skin. The distinction between 
the Supersoul and the conditioned individual soul is that the Supersoul, 
or the Supreme Personality of Godhead, maintains His natural opulences, 
known as §a�-aisvarya, a§ta-siddhi and a§ta-gupa. 
Because of their poor fund .of knowledge, the Mayavadi philosophers 
forget the fact that Kr��a is always full of six opulences, eight transcendental 
qualities and eight kinds of perfection. The six opulences are that no one is 
greater than Kf�p.a in wealth, in strength, in beauty, in fame, in knowledge 
and in renunciation. The first of Kr�p.a 's six transcendental qualities is that 
He is always untouched by the contamination of material existence. This 
is also mentioned in the Isopani§ad: apiipa-viddham: just as the sun is 
Prayers by the Personified Vedas 
293 
never polluted by any contamination, the Supreme Lord is never polluted 
by any sinful activities. Similarly, although Kr�J)a's actions might sometimes 
seem to he impious, He is never polluted by such actions. The second 
transcendental quality is that Kr�J)a never dies. In the Bhagavad-gitii., Fourth 
Chapter, He informs Arjuna that both He and Arjuna had many appearances 
in this material world, hut He alone remembers all such activities-past, 
present and future. This means that He never dies. Forgetfulness is due to 
death. As we die, we change our bodies. That is forgetfulness. Kr�p.a, 
however, is never forgetful. He can remember everything that has happened 
in the past. Otherwise, how could He remember that He first taught the 
Bhagavad-gitii. yoga system to the sun-god, Vivasvan? Therefore, He never 
dies. Nor does He ever become an old man. Although Kr�J)a was a great­
grandfather when He appeared on the Battlefield of Kuruk�etra, He did not 
appear as an old man. Kf�J)a cannot he polluted by any sinful activities, 
Kf�J)a never dies, Kf�J)a never becomes old, Kr�p.a never becomes subjected 
to any lamentation, Kf�J)a is never hungry, and He is never thirsty. What­
ever He desires is perfectly lawful, and whatever He decides cannot he 
changed by anyone. These are the transcendental qualities of Kr�p.a. 
Besides that, Kr�q.a is known as Y ogesvara. He has all the opulences or 
fa<;ilities of mystic powers, such as a!Lima-siddhi, the power to become 
smaller than the smallest. It is stated in the Brahma-samhitii that Krwa has 
entered even within the atom, a!Lt)iintarastha-paramii.rtu-cayiintarastham. 
Similarly, Kr�p.a, as Garhhodakasayi Vi�p.u, is within the gigantic universe, 
and He is lying in the Causal Ocean as Maha-Vi�J)U in a body so gigantic 
that when He exhales, millions and trillions of universes emanate from His 
body. This is called mahima-siddhi. Kr§p.a also has the perfection of 
laghimii: He can become the lightest. It is stated in the Bhagavad-gitii that 
it is because Kr§p.a enters within this universe and within the atoms that 
all the planets are floating in the air. That is the explan_ation of weightless­
ness. Kr�p.a also has the perfection of priipti: He can get whatever He 
likes. Similarly, He has the facility of isitii., controlling power. He is 
called the supreme controller, Paramesvara. In addition, Kr�p.a can bring 
anyone under His influence. This is called vasitii.. 
Kr�p.a is endowed with all opulences, transcendental qualities and mystic 
powers. No ordinary living being can he compared to Him. Therefore, the 
Mayavadis' theory that the Supersoul and the individual soul are equal is 
only a misconception. The conclusion is, therefore, that Krwa is worship­
able and that all other living entities are simply His servants. This under­
standing is called self-realization. Any other realization of one's self beyond 
this relationship of eternal servitorship of Kr�p.a is impelled by mii.yii.. It is 
294 
Kr��a, the Supreme Personality of Godhead 
said that the last snare of maya is to dictate to the living entity to try to 
become equal to the Supreme Personality of Godhead. The Mayavadi 
philosopher claims to be equal to God, but he cannot reply to the question 
of why he has fallen into material entanglement. If He is the Supreme God, 
then how is it that he has been overtaken by impious activities and thereby 
subjected to the tribulations of the law of karma? When the Mayavadis are 
asked about this, they cannot properly answer. The speculation that one is 
equal to the Supreme Personality of Godhead is another symptom of 
sinful life. One cannot take to Kr��a consciousness unless he is completely 
freed from all sinful activities. The very fact that the Mayavadi claims to 
become one with the Supreme Lord means that he is not yet freed from 
the reactions of sinful activities. Srimad-Bhagavatam says that such persons 
are avisuddha-buddhaya, which means that they falsely think themselves 
liberated, although at the same time they think themselves equal with the 
Absolute Truth. Their intelligence is not purified. 
The personified Vedas said that if the yogis and the jnanis do not free 
themselves from sinful desires, then their particular process ·of self­
realization will never be successful. "My dear Lord," the personified Vedas 
continued, "if saintly persons do not take care to eradicate completely the 
roots of sinful desires, they cannot experience the Supersoul, although He 
is sitting side by side with the individual soul. Samadhi, or meditation, 
means that one has to find the Supersoul within himself. One who is not 
free from sinful reactions cannot see the Supersoul. If a person has a 
jeweled locket in his necklace but forgets the jewel, it is almost as though 
he does not. possess it. Similarly, if an individual soul meditates bd does 
not actually perceive the presence of the Supersoul within himself, he has 
not realized the Supersoul. Persons who have taken to the path of self­
realization must therefore be very careful to be uncontaminated by the 
influence of maya. Srila Riipa Gosvami says that a devotee should be 
completely free from all sorts of material desires. A devotee should not 
be affected by the resultant actions of karma and jnana. One simply has to 
understand Kr��a and carry out His desires. That is the pure devotional 
stage. Mystic yogis who still have contaminated desires for sense gratifica­
tion never become successful in their attempt, nor can they realize the 
Supersoul within the individual self. As such, the so-called yogis and jnanis 
who are simply wasting their time in different types of sense gratification, 
either by mental speculation or by exhibition of limited mystic powers, will 
never become liberated from conditional life and will continue to go 
through repeated births and deaths. For such persons, both this life and 
the next life becomes sources of tribulation. Such sinful persons are al-
Prayers by the Personified Vedas 
295 
ready suffering tribulation in this life, and because they are not perfect in 
self-realization, they will be plagued with further tribulation in the next 
life. Despite all endeavors to attain perfection, such yogis, contaminated 
by desires for sense gratification, will continue to suffer in this life and in 
the next. 
Srila Visvanatha Cakravarti Thakur remarks in this connection that if 
sannyiisis and persons in the renounced order of life who have left their 
homes for self-realization do not engage themselves in the devotional 
service of the Lord but become attracted by philanthropic work, such as 
opening educational institutions, hospitals, or even monastaries, churches 
or temples of demigods, they find only trouble from such engagements, 
not only in this life but in the next. Sannyiisis who do not take advantage 
of this life to realize Kr��a simply waste their time and energy in activities 
outside the jurisdiction of the renounced order of life. A devotee's attempt 
to engage his energies in such activities as constructing a Vi��u temple is, 
however, never wasted. Such engagements are called Knrarthe akhila­
ce§tii, variegated activities performed to please Kr��a. A philanthropist's 
opening a school building and a devotee's constructing a temple are not on 
the same level. Although a philanthropist's opening an educational insti­
tution may be pious activity, it comes under the laws of karma, whereas 
constructing a temple for Vi��u is devotional service. 
Devotional service is never within the jurisdiction of the law of karma. 
It is stated in the Bhagavad-gitii that devotees transcend the reaction of the 
three modes of material nature and stand on the platform of Brahman 
realization: brahma-bhiiyiiya kalpate. The Bhagavad-gitii says, sa gurz,iin 
samatityaitiin brahma-bhiiyiiya: kalpate: devotees of the Personality of 
Godhead transcend all the reactions of the three modes of material nature 
and are situated on the transcendental Brahman platform. The devotees 
are liberated both in this life and in the next life. Any work done in this 
material world for Y ajfia or Vi��u or Kr��a is considered to be liberated 
work, but without connection with Acyuta, the infallible Supreme Person­
ality of Godhead, there is no possibility of stopping the resultant actions 
of the law of karma. The life of Kr��a consciousness is the life of libera­
tion. The conclusion is that a devotee, by the grace of the Lord, is 
liberated, both in this life and the next, whereas karmis, jiiiinis and yogis 
are never liberated, either in this life or in the next. 
The personified Vedas continued: "Dear Lord, anyone who, by Your 
grace, has understood the glories of Your lotus feet is callous to material 
happiness and distress. The material pangs are inevitable as long as we are 
existing within the material world, but a devotee does not divert his atten-
296 
Kr��a, the Supreme Personality of Godhead 
tion to such actions and reactions, which are the result of pious and im­
pious activities. Nor is a devotee very much disturbed or pleased by 
praise or condemnation by the people in general. A devotee is sometimes 
greatly praised by the people in general because of his transcendental 
activities, and sometimes he is criticized, even though there is no reason 
for adverse criticism. The pure devotee is always callous to praise or 
condemnation by the ordinary people. Actually, the devotee's activities 
are on the transcendental plane. He is not interested in the praise or 
condemnation of people engaged in material activities. If the devotee can 
thus maintain his transcendental position, then his liberation in this life 
and in the next life is guaranteed by the Supreme Personality of Godhead. 
A devotee's transcendental position within this material world is maintained 
in the association of pure devotees, simply by hearing the glorious activities 
enacted by the Lord in different ages and in different incarnations." 
The Kr��a consciousness movement is based on this principle. Srila 
Narottama dasa Thakur has sung, "My dear Lord, let me be engaged in 
Your transcendental loving service, as indicated by the previou.s iiciiryas, 
and let me live in the association of pure devotees. That is my desire, life 
after life." In other words, a devotee does not much care whether or not 
he is liberated, but he is anxious only for devotional service. Devotional 
service means that one does not do anything independently of the sanction 
of the iiciiryas. The action� of the Kr��a consciousness movement are 
directed by the previous iiciiryas, headed by Srila Rupa Gosvami; in the 
association of devotees following these principles, a devotee is able to 
perfectly maintain his transcendental position. 
In the Bhagavad-gitii, the Lord says that a devotee who knows Him 
perfectly is very dear to Him. Four kinds of pious men take to devotional 
service. If a man is pious, then in his distressed condition he approaches 
the Lord for mitigation of his distress. If a pious man is in need of material 
help, he also prays to the Lord for such help. If a pious man is actually 
inquisitive about the science of God, he also approaches the Supreme 
Personality of Godhead, Kr��a. Similarly, a pious man who is simply 
anxious to know the science of Kr§�a also approaches the Supreme Lord. 
Out of these four classes of men, the last is praised by Kr§�a Himself in 
the Bhagavad-gitii. A person who tries to understand Kr§�a with full 
knowledge and devotion by following in the footsteps of previous iiciiryas 
conversant with the scientific knowledge of the Supreme Lord is praise­
worthy. Such a devotee can understand that all conditions of life, favorable 
and unfavorable, are created by the supreme will of the Lord. And when 
he has fully surrendered unto the lotus feet of the Supreme Lord, he does 
Prayers by the Personified Vedas 
297 
not care whether his condition of life is favorable or unfavorable. A devotee 
takes even an unfavorable condition to be the special favor of the Person­
ality of Godhead. Actually, there are no unfavorable conditions for a 
devotee. He sees everything coming by the will of the Lord as favorable, 
and in any condition of life he is simply enthusiastic to discharge his 
devotional service. This devotional attitude is explained in the Bhagavad­
gita: a devotee is never distressed in reverse conditions of life, nor is he 
overjoyed in favorable conditions. In the higher stages of devotional 
service, a devotee is not even concerned with the list of do's and do not's. 
Such a position can be maintained only by following in the footsteps of 
the iicaryas. Because a pure devotee follows in the footsteps of the iiciiryas, 
any action he performs to discharge devotional service is to be understood 
to be on the transcendental platform. Lord Kr�l).a therefore instructs us 
that an iiciirya is above criticism. A neophyte devotee should not consider 
himself to be on the same plane as the iiciirya. It should be accepted that 
the iicaryas are on the same platform as the Supreme Personality of God­
head, and as such, neither Kr�l).a nor His representative iiciirya should be 
subject to any adverse criticism by the neophyte devotees. 
The personified Vedas thus worshiped the Supreme Personality of 
Godhead in different ways. Offering worship to the Supreme Lord by 
praying means remembering His transcendental qualities, pastimes and 
activities. But the Lord's pastimes and qualities are unlimited. It is not 
possible for us to r�member all the qualities of the Lord. Therefore, the 
personified Vedas worshiped to the best of their ability, and at the end 
they spoke as follows. 
"Our dear Lord, although Lord Brahma, the predominating deity of the 
highest planet, Brahmaloka, and King lndra, the predominating demigod 
of the heavenly planet, as well as the predominating deities of the sun 
planet, the moon planet, etc., are all very confidential directors of this 
material world, they have very little knowledge about You. And what to 
speak of ordinary human beings and mental speculators? It is not possible 
for anyone to enumerate the unlimited transcendental qualities of Your 
Lordship. No one, including the mental speculators and the demigods in 
higher planetary systems, is actually able to estimate the length and 
breadth of Your form and characteristics. We think that even Your 
Lordship does not have complete knowledge of Your transcendental 
qualities. The reason is that You are unlimited. Although it is not befitting 
in Your case to say that You do not know Yourself, it is nevertheless 
practical to understand that because You have unlimited qualities and 
energies and because Your knowledge is also unlimited, there is unlimited 
298 
Kr��a, the Supreme Personality of Godhead 
competition between Your knowledge and Your expansion of energies." 
The idea is that because God and His knowledge are both unlimited, as 
soon as God is cognizant of some of His energies, He perceives that He has 
still more energies. In this way, both His energies and His knowledge 
increase. Because both of them are unlimited, there is no end to the 
energies and no end to the knowledge with which to understand the 
energies. God is undoubtedly omniscient, but the personified Vedas say 
that even God Himself does not know the full extent of His energies. This 
does not mean that God is not omniscient. When an actual fact is unknown 
to a certain person, this is called ignorance or lack of knowledge. This is 
not applicable to God, however, because He knows Himself perfectly, but 
still His energies and activities increase. Therefore He also increases His 
knowledge to understand it. Both are increasing unlimitedly, and there is 
no end to it. In that sense it can be said that even God Himself does not 
know the limit of His energies and qualities. 
How God is unlimited in His expansion of energies and activities can be 
roughly calculated by any sane and sober living entity. It is said in the Vedic 
literature that innumerable universes issue forth wheri Maha-Vi�ttu exhales 
in His yoga-nidrii, and innumerable universes enter His body when He again 
inhales. We have to imagine that these universes, which, according to our 
limited knowledge, are expanded unlimitedly, are so great that the gross 
ingredients, the five elements of the cosmic manifestation, namely earth, 
water, fire, air and sky, are not only within the universe, but are covering 
the universe in seven layers, each layer ten times bigger than the previous 
one. In this way, each and every universe is very securely packed, and there 
are numberless universes. All these universes are floating within the 
innumerable pores of the transcendental body of Maha-Vi§tJ.U- It is stated 
that just as the atoms and particles of dust are floating within the air along 
with the birds and their number cannot be calculated, so innumerable 
universes are floating within the, pores of the transcendental body of the 
Lord. For this reason, the Vedas say that God is beyond the capacity of 
our knowledge. Abiinmanasagocara: to understand the length and breadth 
of God is beyond the jurisdiction of our mental speculation. Therefore, a 
person who is actually learned and sane does not claim to be God, but tries 
to understand God, making distinctions between spirit and matter. By 
such careful discrimination, one can clearly understand that the Supreme 
Soul is transcendental to both the superior and inferior energies, although 
He has a direct connection with both. In the Bhagavad-gitii, Lord Kr�tta 
explains that although everything is resting on His energy, He is different 
or separate from the energy. 
Nature and the living entities are sometimes designated as prakrti and 
Prayers by the Personified Vedas 
299 
puru§a respectively. The whole cosmic manifestation is an amalgamation 
of the prakrti and puru§a. Nature is the ingredient cause, and the living 
entities are the effective cause. These two causes combine together, and 
the effect is this cosmic manifestation. When one is fortunate enough to 
come to the right conclusion about this cosmic manifestation and every­
thing which is going on within it, he knows it to be caused directly and 
indirectly by the Supreme Personality of Godhead Himself. It is concluded 
in the Brahma-sarhhita, therefore, iSvara� parama� k[§[ta� sac-cid-unanda­
vigraha� anadir adir govinda� sarva-kurarw-kurar-am. 
After much deliberation and consideration, when one has attained the 
the perfection of knowledge, he comes to the conclusion that Kr�!la, or 
God, is the original cause of all causes. Instead of speculating about the 
measurement of God-whether He is so long or so wide-or philosophizing, 
one should come to the conclusion of Brahma-sarhhitu: sarva-kurarza­
kurarzam: "Kr�!la, or God, is the cause of all causes." That is the perfection 
of knowledge. 
Thus the Veda-stuti, or the prayers offered by the personified Vedas to 
the Garbhodakasayi Vi�!lu, were first narrated in disciplic succession by 
Sanandana to his brothers, all of whom were born of Brahma. In the 
beginning the four Kumaras were the first-born of Brahma; therefore they 
are known as pfirva-juta. It is stated in the Bhagavad-gita that the param­
para system, or the disciplic succession, begins with Krwa Himself. 
Similarly, here, in the prayers of the personified Vedas, it is to be under­
stood that the parampara system begins with the Personality of Godhead 
Naraya!la ��i. We should remember that this Veda-stuti is being narrated 
by Kumara Sanandana, and the narration is being repeated by Naraya!la 
��i in Bodi Asrama. Naraya!la ��i is the incarnation of Kr�!la for 
showing us the path of self-realization by undergoing severe austerities. 
In this age Lord Caitanya demonstrated the path of pure devotional service 
by putting Himself in the role of a pure devotee. Similarly, in the past 
Lord Naraya!la ��i was an incarnation of Kr�!la who performed severe 
austerities in the Himalayan ranges. Sri Narada Muni was hearing from 
Him. So in the statement given by Naraya!la ��i to Narada Muni, as it was 
narrated by Kumara Sanandana in the form of Veda-stuti, it is understood 
that God is the one supreme and that all others are His servants. 
In the Caitanya-caritumrta it is stated, ekalii isvara kr§rza: "Kr�!la is the 
only Supreme God." Ara sava bhrtya: "All others are His servants." Yiire 
yaiche niiciiya, se taiche kare nrtya: "The Supreme Lord, as He desires, is 
engaging all the living entities in different activities, and thus they are exhib­
iting their different talents and tendencies." This Veda-stuti is thus the orig­
inal instruction regarding the relationship existing between the living entity 
300 
Kr��a, the Supreme Personality of Godhead 
their different talents and tendencies." This Veda-stuti is thus the original 
instruction regarding the relationship existing between the living entity 
and the Supreme Personality of Godhead. The highest platform of realiza­
tion for the living entity is the attainment of this devotional life. One 
cannot be engaged in devotional life or Kr�tta consciousness unless he is 
fully free from material contamination. Narayatta ��i informed Narada 
Muni that the essence of all Vedas and Vedic literatures (namely, the four 
Vedas, the Upani§ads, the Purarws) teaches the rendering of transcendental 
loving service to the Lord. In this connection Narayatta ��i has used one 
particular word -rasa. In devotional service this rasa is the via media or the 
basic principle for exchanging a relationship between the Lord and the 
living entity. A rasa is also described in the Vedas as iSavasya: "The 
Supreme Lord is the reservoir of all pleasure." All the Vedic literatures, the 
Purii"[WS, the Vedas, the Upani§ads, the Vedanta-siitras, etc., are teaching 
the living entities how to attain the stage of rasa. The Bhagavatam also 
says that the statements in the Mahiipuriira (Srimad-Bhiigavatam) contain 
the essence of rasas in all Vedic literatures. Nigama-kalpa-taror galitarh 
phalarh. The Bhiigavata m is the essence of the ripen fruit in the tree of the 
Vedic literature. 
We understand that with the breathing of the Supreme Personality of 
Godhead there issued forth the four Vedas, namely the J.{g-veda, the 
Siima-veda, Y ajur-veda, and the A tharva-veda, and the histories like the 
Mahiibhiirata and all the Puriirws, which are also considered to be the 
history of the world. The Vedic histories like the Puriiras and Mahii­
bhiirata are called the fifth Veda. 
The verses of Veda-stuti are to be considered the essence of all Vedic 
knowledge. The four Kumaras and all other authorized sages know per­
fectly that devotional service in Kr�tta consciousness is the essence of all 
Vedic literatures, and they are preaching this in different planets, traveling 
in outer space. It is stated herein that such sages, including Narada Muni, 
hardly ever travel on land; they are perpetually traveling in space. 
Sages like Narada and the Kumaras travel throughout the universe in 
order to educate the conditioned souls and show them that their business 
in the world is not that of sense gratification, but of reinstating themselves 
again in their original position of devotional service to the Supreme Person­
ality of Godhead. It is stated in several places that the living entities are 
like sparks of the fire, and the Supreme Personality of Godhead is like the 
fire itself. Somehow or other when the sparks fall out of the fire they lose 
their natural illumination; thus it is ascertained that the living entities 
come into this material world exactly as sparks fall from a great fire. The 
Prayers by the Personified Vedas 
301 
reason for this fall, as stated by the Gosvamis, is sense gratification. The 
living entity wants to imitate Kr��a and tries to lord it over material nature; 
thus he forgets his original position, and his illuminating power, his 
spiritual identity, is extinguished. However, if a living entity takes to Kr��a 
consciousness, he is reinstated in his original position. Sages and saints like 
Narada and the Kumaras are traveling all over the universe educating 
people and encouraging their disciples to preach this process of devotional 
service so that all the conditioned souls may be able to revive their original 
consciousness, or Kr��a consciousness, and thus gain relief from the 
miserable conditions of material life. 
· 
Sri Narada Muni is nai§tika-brahmaciiri. 
There are four types of 
brahmaciiri, and the first is called siivitra, which refers to a brahmaciiri 
who, after initiation and the sacred thread ceremony, must observe at 
least three days celibacy. The next is called priijiipatya, which refers to a 
brahmaciiri who strictly observes celibacy for at least one year after 
initiation. 
The next is called briihma-brahmaciiri, which refers to a 
brahmaciiri who observes celibacy from the time of initiation up to the 
time of the completion of his study of Vedic literature. The next stage is 
called nai§tika, which refers to a brahmaciiri who is celibate throughout his 
whole life. Out of these, the first three are upakurviina, which means that 
the brahmaciiri can marry later on after the brahmaciiri period is over. The 
nai§tika-brahmaciiri is completely reluctant to have any sex life; therefore 
the Kumaras and Narada are known as nai§tika-brahmaciiris. The brahma­
ciiri system of life is especially advantageous in that it increases the power 
of memory and determination. It is specifically mentioned in this connec­
tion that because Narada was nai§tika-brahmaciiri he could remember 
whatever he heard from his spiritual master and would never forget it. One 
who can remember everything perpetually is called sruta-dhara. A sruta­
dhara brahmaciiri can repeat all that he has heard verbatim without notes 
and without reference to books. The great sage Narada has this qualifica­
tion, and therefore, taking instruction from Nar:Iyap.a ��i, he is engaged in 
propagating the philosophy of devotional service all over the world. 
Because such great sages can remember everything, they are very much 
thoughtful, self-realized and completely fixed in the service of the Lord. 
Thus the great sage Narada, after hearing from his spiritual master 
Naraya�a ��i, became completely realized. He became established in the 
truth, and he became so happy that he offered the following prayers to 
Naraya�a ��i. 
A nai§thika-brahmaciiri is also called vira-vrata. Narada Muni addressed 
Naraya�a ��i as an incarnation of Kr��a, and he specifically addressed him 
302 
Kr��a, the Supreme Personality of Godhead 
as the supreme well-wisher of the conditioned souls. It is stated in the 
Bhagavad-gitii that Lord Kr��a descends in every millennium just to give 
protection to His devotees and to annihilate the nondevotees. Naraya�a 
:{t�i, also being an incarnation of Kr��a, is also addressed as the well-wisher 
of the conditioned souls. As is stated in the Bhagavad-gitii, everyone 
should know that there is no well-wisher like Kr��a. Everyone should 
understand that Lord Kr��a is the well-wisher of everyone and should 
take shelter unto Kr��a. In this way one can become completely 
confident and satisfied knowing that he has someone who is able to give 
him all protection. Kr��a Himself, His incarnations and His plenary 
expansions are all supreme well-wishers of the conditioned souls, but 
Kr��a is the well-wisher even for the demons, for He gave salvation to all 
demons who came to kill Him at Vrndavana; therefore Kr��a's welfare 
activities are absolute, for even though He annihilates a demon or gives 
protection to a devotee, His activities are one and the same. It is said that 
the demon Piitana was elevated to the same position as Kr��a 's mother. 
When KH�a kills a demon it should be known that the demon is supremely 
benefitted by this; however, a pure devotee is always protected by the 
Lord. 
Narada Muni, after offering respects,to his spiritual master, went to the 
iisrama of Vyasadeva and narrated the entire story to his disciple. Thus 
Narada Muni, being properly received by Vyasadeva in his iisrama and 
seated very comfortably, began to narrate what he had heard from 
Naraya�a :{t�i. In this way Sukadeva Gosvami informed Maharaja Parik�it 
of the answers to his questions regarding the essence of Vedic knowledge 
and regarding what is considered to be the ultimate goal in the Vedas. The 
supreme goal in life is to seek the transcendental blessings of the Supreme 
Personality of Godhead and thus become engaged in the loving service of 
the Lord. One should follow in the footsteps of Sukadeva Gosvami and all 
the V ai��avas in the disciplic succession and should pay respectful obei­
sances unto Lord Kr��a the Supreme Personality of Godhead Hari. The 
four sects of V ai��ava disciplic succession, namely the Madhva-sampra­
daya, the Ramanuja-sampradaya, the Vi��usvami-sampradaya, and the 
Nimbarka-sampradaya, in pursuance of all Vedic conclusions, agree that 
one should surrender unto the Supreme Personality of Godhead. 
The Vedic literatures are divided into two parts: the srutis and the 
smrtis. The srutis are the four Vedas: .f{k, Siima, Atharva and Yajus, and 
the Upan�ads, and the smrtis are the Purarws like Mahiibhiirata, which 
includes Bhagavad-gitii. The conclusion of all these is that one should 
know Sri Kr��a as the Supreme Personality ,of Godhead. He is the 
Prayers by the Personified Vedas 
303 
Parampuru�a, or the Supreme Personality of Godhead under whose super­
intendence material nature works, being created, maintained and de­
stroyed. After the creation, the Supreme Lord incarnates into three, 
Brahma, Viwu and Lord Siva. All of these take charge of the three 
qualities of material nature, but the ultimate direction is in the hand of 
Lord Vi�!J.U. The complete activities of material nature under the three 
modes are being conducted under the direction of the Supreme Personality 
of Godhead, Kr�!J.a. This is confirmed in the Bhagavad-gitii, nyadarsana, 
and in the Vedas: sa aik�ata. 
The atheistic Sankhyaite philosophers offer their arguments that this 
material cosmic manifestation is due to prakrti and puru§a. They argue 
that nature and material energy constitute the material cause and the 
effective cause. But Kr�!la is the cause of all causes. He is the cause of all 
material and effective causes. Prakrti and puru§a are not the ultimate 
cause. Superficially it appears that a child is born due to the combination 
of the father and mother, but the ultimate cause of both the father and the 
mother is Kr�!J.a. He is therefore the original cause, or the cause of all 
causes, as is confirmed in the Brahma-sarhhitii. 
In the material nature, both the Supreme Lord and the living entities 
enter. The Supreme Lord Kr�!J.a, by one of His plenary expansions, 
manifests as the K�irodakasayi Vi�!J.U and the Maha-Vi�!J.U, the gigantic 
Vi�!J.U form lying in the Causal Ocean. Then from that gigantic form of 
the Maha-Vi�!lu, the Garbhodakasayi Vi�!J.U expands in every universe. 
From Him, Brahma, Vi�!lu and Siva expand. Vi�!J.U enters into the hearts 
of all living entities, as well as into all material elements, including the 
atom. The Brahma-sarhhitii says: arfliintarastha-paramiiru-cayiintarastham. 
He is within this universe and also within every atom. 
The living entity has a small material body. taken from various species 
and forms, and similarly the whole universe is but the material body of 
the Supreme Personality of Godhead. This body is described in the siistras 
as viriita riipa. As the individual living entity maintains his particular body, 
the Supreme Personality of Godhead maintains the whole cosmic creation 
and everything within it. As soon as the individual living entity leaves the 
material body, the body is immediately annihilated, and similarly as soon 
as Lord Vi�!J.U leaves the cosmic manifestation, everything is annihilated. 
Only when the individual living entity surrenders unto�the Supreme 
Personality of Godhead is his liberation from material existence assured. 
This is confirmed in the Bhagavad-gitii: miim eva ye prapadyante miiyiim 
etiirh taranti te. Surrendering unto the Supreme Personality of Godhead is 
therefore the cause of liberation and nothing else. How the living entity 
304 
Kr��a, the Supreme Personality of Godhead 
becomes liberated from the modes of material nature after surrendering 
unto the Supreme Personality of Godhead is illustrated by a sleeping man 
within a room. When a man is sleeping, everyone sees that he is present 
within the room, but actually the man himself is not within that body, for 
while sleeping a man forgets his bodily existence, although others may see 
that his body is present. Similarly, a liberated person engaged in devotional 
service of the Lord may be seen by others to be engaged in the household 
duties of the material world, but since his consciousness is fixed in Kr�.t;ta 
he does not live within this world. His engagements are different, exactly 
as the sleeping man's engagements are different from his bodily engage­
ments. It is confirmed in the Bhagavad-gitii that a devotee engaged full 
time in the transcendental loving service of the Lord has already surpassed 
the influence of the three modes of material nature. He is already situated 
on the Brahman platform of spiritual realization, although he appears to 
be living with the body or within the material world. 
Srlla Riipa Gosvami stated in this connection in his Bhakti-rasiimrta­
sindhu that the person whose only desire is to serve the Supreme Person­
ality of Godhead may be situated in any condition in the material 
world, but he is to be understood as jivanmukta, that is to say he is to be 
considered liberated while living within the body or the material world. 
The conclusion, therefore, is that a person fully engaged in Kr�.t;ta 
consciousness is a liberated person. Such a person has actually nothing to 
do with the material world. Those who are not in Kr�.t;ta consciousness 
are called karmis and jfiiinis, and they hover on the bodily and mental 
platform and thus are not liberated. This situation is called kaivalya­
nirasta-yoni. A person situated on the transcendental platform becomes 
freed from the repetition of birth and death. This is also confirmed in 
Bhagavad-gitii, Fourth Chapter. Simply by knowing the transcendental 
nature of the Supreme Personality of Godhead K��.t;ta, one becomes free 
from the chains of the repetition of birth and death, and after quitting 
his present body he goes back home, back to Godhead. This is the 
conclusion of all the Vedas. Thus one should surrender unto the lotus feet 
of Lord Kr�.t;ta after understanding the prayers offered by the personified 
Vedas. 
Thus end the Bhaktivedanta purports of the Second Volume, Thirty­
Second Chapter of Kr�va, "Prayers by the Personified Vedas." 
33 I Deliverance of Lord Siva 
As a great devotee of Kr�!la, King Parik�it was already liberated, but for 
clarification he was asking various questions of Sukadeva Gosvami In the 
previous chapter, King Pan"K�it's question was, "What is the ultimate goal 
of the 
Vedas?" And Sukadeva Gosvami explained the matter, giving 
authoritative descriptions from the disciplic succession, beginning with 
Sanandana down to Naraya!la ��i, Narada, Vyasadeva, and then he himself. 
The conclusion was that devotional service, or bhakti, is the ultimate goal 
of the Vedas. A neophyte devotee may question, "If the ultimate goal of 
life, or the conclusion of the Vedas, is to elevate oneself to the platform 
of devotional service, then why is it observed that a devotee of Lord Viwu 
is generally not very prosperous materially, whereas a devotee of Lord Siva 
is found to be very opulent?" In order to clarify this matter, Parik�it 
Maharaja asked Sukadeva Gosvami: "My dear Sukadeva Gosvami, it is 
generally found that those who engage in the worship of Lord Siva, 
whether in human, demoniac, or demigod society, become very opulent 
materially, although Lord Siva himself lives just like a poverty-stricken 
person. On the other hand, the devotees of Lord Vi�!lu, who is the 
controller of the goddess of fortune, do not appear to be very prosperous, 
and sometimes they are even found to be living without any material opu­
lence at all. Lord Siva lives underneath a tree or in the snow of the 
Himalayan Mountains. He does not even construct a house for himself, but 
still the worshipers of Lord Siva are very rich. Kr�!la, or Lord Vi�pu, 
however, lives very opulently, whether in Vaikuptha or in this material 
world, but His devotees appear to be poverty-stricken. Why is this so?" 
Maharaja Parik�it's question is very intelligent. The two classes· of 
devotees, namely the devotees of Lord Siva and the devotees of Lord 
Vi�!lu, are always in disagreement. Even today in India these two classes 
of devotees still criticize each other, and especially in South India, the 
305 
306 
Kr�!la, the Supreme Personality of Godhead
followers of Ramanujacarya and the followers of Saitkaracarya hold 
occasional meetings for understanding the Vedic conclusion. Generally, the 
followers of Ramanujacarya come out victorious in such meetings. So 
Parik�it Maharaja wanted to clarify the situation by asking this question 
of Sukadeva Gosvami. That Lord Siva lives as a poor man although his 
devotees appear to be very opulent, whereas Lord Kr�!la or Lord Viwu is 
always opulent, and yet His devotees appear to be poverty-stricken, is a 
situation which appears contradictory and puzzling to a discriminating 
person. 
Sukadeva Gosvami began to reply to King Parik�it's inquiry about the 
apparent contradictions regarding the worship of Lord Siva and that of 
Lord Vi�!J.U. Lord Siva is the master of the material energy. The material 
energy is represented by goddess Durga, and Lord Siva happens to be her 
husband. Since goddess Durga is completely under the subjugation of Lord 
Siva, it is to be understood that Lord Siva is the master of this material 
energy. The material energy is manifested in three qualities, namely good­
ness, passion and ignorance, and therefore Lord Siva is the master .of these 
three qualities. Although he is in association with these qualities for the 
benefit of the conditioned soul, Lord Siva is the director and is not affect­
ed. Although the conditioned soul is affected by the three qualities, Lord 
Siva, because he is the master of these qualities, is not affected by them. 
From the statements of Sukadeva Gosvami we can understand that the 
effects of worshiping different demigods are not, as some less intelligent 
persons suppose, the same as the effects of worshiping Lord Vi�!J.U. He 
clearly states that by worshiping Lord Siva one achieves one reward, 
whereas by worshiping Lord Vi�!J.U one achieves a different reward. This is 
also confirmed in the Bhagavad-gitii: those who worship the different 
demigods achieve the desired results which the respective demigods can 
reward. 
Similarly, those who worship the material energy receive the 
suitable reward for such activities, and those who worship the pitas receive 
similar results. But those who are engaged in devotional service or worship 
of the Supreme Lord, Vi�!J.U or Kr�!J.a, go to the Vaiku!J.tha planets or 
Kr�!J.aloka. One cannot approach the transcendental region or paravyoma, 
the spiritual sky, by worshiping Lord Siva or Brahma or any other 
demigod. 
Since this material world is a product of the three qualities of material 
nature, all varieties of manifestations come from those three qualities. 
With the aid of materialistic science, modern civilization has created many 
machines and comforts of life, and yet they are only varieties of the 
interactions of the three material qualities. Although the devotees of Lord 
Deliverance of Lord Siva 
307 
Siva are able to obtain many material acquisitions, we should know that 
they are simply collecting products manufactured by the three qualities. 
The three qualities are again subdivided into sixteen, namely the ten senses 
(five working senses and the five knowledge-acquiring senses), the mind, 
and the five elements (earth, water, air, fire and sky). These sixteen items 
are further extensions of the three qualities. Material happiness or opu­
lence means gratification of the senses, specifically the genitals, the tongue 
and the mind. By exercising our minds we create many pleasurable things 
just for enjoyment by the genitals and the tongue. The opulence of a 
person within this material world is estimated in terms of his exercise of 
the genitals and the tongue, or in other words, how well he is able to 
utilize his sexual capacities and how well he is able to satisfy his fastidious 
taste by eating palatable dishes. Material advancement of civilization 
necessitates creating objects of enjoyment by mental concoction just to 
become happy on the basis of these two principles: pleasures for the 
genitals and pleasures for the tongue. Herein lies the answer to King 
Parik�it's question to Sukadev:a Gosvami as to why the worshipers of Lord 
Siva ·are so opulent. 
The devotees of Lord Siva are only opulent in terms of the material 
qualities. Factually, such so-called advancement of civilization is the cause 
of entanglement in material existence. It is actually not advancement, but 
degradation. The conclusion is that because Lord Siva is the master of the 
three qualities, his .devotees are given things manufactured by the inter­
action of these qualities for satisfaction of the senses. In the Bhagavad-gitii, 
however, we get instruction from Lord Kr��a that one has to transcend the 
qualitative existence. Nistraiguryo bhaviirjuna: the mission of human life 
is to become transcendental to the three qualities. Unless one is nistraigurya, 
he cannot get free from material entanglement. In other words, favors 
received from Lord Siva are not actually beneficial to the conditioned 
souls, although apparently such facilities seem to be opulent. 
Sukadeva Gosvami continued: "The Supreme Personality of Godhead 
Hari is transcendental to the three qualities of material nature." It is 
stated in the Bhagavad-gitii that anyone who surrenders unto Him surpasses 
the control of the three qualities of material nature. Therefore, since 
Hari's devotees are transcendental to the control of the three material 
qualities, certainly He Himself is transcendental. It is stated, therefore, in 
the Sri11Uld-Bhiigavatam that Hari, or Kr��a, is the original Supreme 
Personality. There are two kinds of prakrtis, or potencies, namely the 
internal potency and the external potency, and Kr��a is the overlord of 
both these prakrtis or potencies. He is sarva-drk, or the overseer of all the 
I 
I 
308 
Kr��a, the Supreme Personality of Godhead 
actions of the internal and external potencies, and He is also described as 
upadra§ta, the supreme advi�or. Because He is the supreme advisor, He is 
above all the demigods, who merely follow the directions of the supreme 
advisor. As such, if one directly follows the instructions of the Supreme 
Lord, as inculcated in the Bhagavad-gitii and the Srimad-Bhiigavatam, then 
gradually one becomes nirgupa, or above the interaction of the material 
qualities. To be nirgupa means to be bereft of material opulences because, 
as we have explained, material opulence means an increase of the actions 
and reactions of the three material qualities. By worshiping the Supreme 
Personality of Godhead, instead of being puffed up with material opu­
lences one becomes enriched with spiritual advancement of knowledge in 
Kr�!la consciousness. To become nirgupa means to achieve eternal peace, 
fearlessness, religiousness, knowledge and renunciation. All these are 
symptoms of becoming free from the contamination of the material 
qualities. 
. 
Sukadeva Gosvami, in answering PanK.�it Maharaja's question, went on 
to cite an historical instance regarding Parilqit Mahjiraja's grandfather, 
King Yudhi�thira. He said that after finishing the asvamedha sacrifice in 
the great sacrificial arena, King Yudhi�thira, in the presence of great 
authorities, enquired on that very same point: how is it that the devotees 
of Lord Siva become materially opulent, whereas the devotees of Lord 
Vi��u do not? Sukadeva Gosvami specifically referred to King Yudhi�thira 
as "your grandfather" so that Maharaja Parik�it would be encouraged to 
think that he was related to Kr��a and that his grandfathers were intimately 
connected with the Supreme Personality of Godhead. 
Although Kr�!la is always very satisfied by nature, when this question 
was asked by Maharaja Yudhi�thira He became even more satisfied because 
these questions and their answers would bear a great meaning for the 
entire Kr�!la conscious society. Whenever Lord Kr�l)a speaks about some­
thing to a specific devotee, it is not only meant for /hat devotee, but for
the entire human society. Instructions by the Supreme Personality of God­
head are important even to the demigods, headed by Lord Brahma, Lord 
Siva and others, and anyone who does not take advantage of the instructions 
of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who descends within this world 
for the benefit of all living entities, is certainly very unfortunate. 
Lord Kr�!la answered the question of Maharaja Yudhi�thira as follows: 
"If I esp€cially favor a devotee and especially wish to care for him, the 
first thing I do is take away his riches." When the devotee becomes a 
penniless pauper or is put into a comparatively poverty-stricken position, 
his relatives and family members no longer take interest in him, and in 
most cases they give up their connection with him. The devotee then

309 
becomes doubly unhappy. First of all he becomes unhappy because his 
riches have been taken away by Kr�!J.a, and he is made even more unhappy 
when his relatives desert him because of his poverty-stricken position. We 
should note, however, that when a devotee falls into a miserable condition 
in this way, it is not due to past impious activities, known as karma-phala; 
the poverty-stricken position of the devotee is a creation of the Personality 
of Godhead. Similarly, when a devotee becomes materially opulent, that 
is also not due to his pious activities. In either case, whether the devotee 
becomes poorer or richer, the arrangement is made by the Supreme 
Personality of Godhead. This arrangement is especially made by Kr�rta for 
His devotee just to make him completely dependent upon Him and to free 
him from all material obligations. He can then concentrate his energies, 
mind and body-everything-for the service of the Lord, and that is pure 
devotional service. In the Niirada-paiicariitra it is therefore explained, 
saroopiidhi-vinirmuktam, which means "being freed from all designations." 
Works performed for family, society, community, nation, or humanity are 
all designated: "I belong to this society," "I belong to this community," 
"I belong to this nation," "I belong to this species of life." Such identities 
are all merely designations. When, by the grace of the Lord, a devotee 
becomes freed from all designation, his devotional service is actually 
nai§karma. ]iiiinis are very much attracted by the position of nai§karma, in 
which one's actions no longer have material effect. When the devotee's 
actions are freed from effects, they are no longer in the category of karma­
phalam, or fruitive activities. As explained before by the personified Vedas,
the unhappiness and distress of a devotee are produced by the Personality 
of Godhead for the devotee, and the devotee therefore does not care 
whether he is in happiness or in distress. He goes on with his duties in 
executing devotional service. Although his behavior seems to be subject to 
the action and reaction of fruitive activities, he is actually freed from the 
results of action. 
It may be questioned why a devotee is put into such tribulation by the 
Personality of Godhead. The answer is that this kind of arrangement by 
the Lord is just like the father's sometimes becoming unkind to his sons. 
Because the devotee is a surrendered soul and is taken charge of by the 
Supreme Lord, whenever the Lord puts him into any condition of life­
either in distress or happiness-it is to be understood that behind this 
arrangement there is a large plan designed by the Personality of Godhead. 
For example, Lord Kr�rta put the Part9avas into a distressed condition so 
acute that even Grandfather Bhi�ma could not comprehend how such 
distress could occur. He lamented that although the whole Part9ava family 
was headed by King Yudhi�thira, the most pious king, and protected by 
11
310 
Kr�!la, the Supreme Personality of Godhead 
the two great warriors Bhima and Arjuna, and although, above all, the 
Pa!i9avas were all intimate friends and relatives ot Lord Kr�!la, they still 
had to undergo such tribulations. Later on, however, it was proved that 
this was planned by the Supreme Personality of Godhead Kr�!la as part of 
His great mission to annihilate the miscreants and protect the devotees. 
Another question may be raised: Since a devotee is put into different 
kinds of happy and distressful conditions by the arrangement of the 
Personality of Godhead, and a common man is put into such conditions as 
a result of his past deeds, then what is the difference? How is the devotee 
any better than the ordinary karmi? The answer is that the karmis and the
devotees are not on the same level. In whatever condition of life the karmi 
may be, he continues in the cycle of birth and death because the seed of 
karma, or fruitive activity, is there, and it fructifies whenever there is 
opportunity. By the law of karma a common man is perpetually entangled
in repeated birth and death, whereas a devotee's distress and happiness, 
not being under the laws of karma, are part of a temporary arrangement 
by the Supreme Lord which does not entangle the devotee. Such an 
arrangement is made by the Lord only to serve a temporary purpose. If a 
karmi performs auspicious acts, he is elevated to the heavenly planets, and 
if he acts impiously, he is put into a hellish condition of life. But whether 
a devotee acts in a so-called pious or in an impious manner, he is neither
elevated nor degraded, but is transferred to the spiritual kingdom. There­
fore a devotee's happiness and distress and a karmi's happiness and distress 
are not on the same level. This fact is corroborated by a speech by 
Y amaraja to his servants in connection with the liberation of Ajamila. 
Yamaraja advised· his followers that persons who have never uttered the 
holy name of the Lord nor remembered the form, quality and pastimes of 
the Lord should be approached by his watchguards. Y amaraja also advised 
his servants never to approach the devotees. On the contrary, he instructed 
his messengers that if they meet a devotee they should offer their respect­
ful obeisances. So there is no question of a devotee's being promoted or 
degraded within this material world. As there is a gulf of difference 
between the punishment awarded by the mother and the punishment 
awarded by an enemy, so a devotee's distressed condition is not the same 
as the distressed condition of a common karmi.
Here another question may be raised. If God is all-powerful, why should 
He try to reform His devotee by putting him into distress? The answer is
that when the Supreme Personality of Godhead puts His devotee into a 
condition of distress, it is not without purpose. Sometimes the purpose is 
that in distress a devotee's feelings of attachment to Kr�tla are magnified. 
Deliverance of Lord Siva 
311 
For example, when Kr�!la, before leaving the capital of the Pa!l9avas for 
His home, was asking for permission to leave, Kuntidevi said, "My dear 
Kr�!la, in our distressed condition You are always present with us. Now, 
because we have been elevated to a royal position, You are leaving us. I
would therefore prefer to live in distress than to lose You." When a devotee 
is put into a situation of distress, his devotional activities are accelerated. 
Therefore, to show special favor to a devotee, the Lord sometimes puts 
him into distress. Besides that, it is stated that the sweetness of happiness 
is sweeter to those who have tasted bitterness. The Supreme Lord descends 
to this material world just to protect His devotees from distress. In other 
words, if devotees were not in a distressed condition, the Lord would not 
have come down. As for His killing the demons or the miscreants, this can 
be easily done by His various energies, just as many asuras are killed by His 
external energy, goddess Durga. Therefore the Lord does not need to come 
down personally to kill such demons, but when His devotee is in distress 
He must come. Lord Nrsimhadeva appeared not to kill Hira!lyakasipu but 
to see Prahlada and to give him blessings. In other words, because Prahlada 
Maharaja was put into very great distress, the Lord appeared. 
When, after the dense, dark night, there is finally sunrise in the morning, 
it is very pleasant. When there is scorching heat, cold water is very pleasant. 
And when there is freezing winter, hot water is very pleasant. Similarly, 
when a devotee, after experiencing the condition of the material world, 
relishes the spiritual happiness awarded by the Lord, his position becomes 
still more pleasant and enjoyable. 
The Lord continued: "When My devotee is bereft of all material riches 
and is deserted by his relatives, friends and family members, because he has 
no one to look after him, he completely takes shelter of the lotus feet of 
the Lord." Srila Narottamadasa Thakur has sung in this connection, "My 
dear Lord Krwa, 0 son of N anda Maharaja, You are now standing before 
me along with Srimati Radhara!li, the daughter of King Vr�abhanu. I am 
now surrendering unto You. Please accept me. Please do not kick me away. 
I have no shelter other than You." 
When a devotee is thus put into so-called miserable conditions and is 
bereft of riches and family, he tries to revive his original position of 
material opulence. But although he tries again and again, Krwa again and 
again takes away all his resources. Thus he finally becomes disappointed in 
material activities, and in that stage of frustration in all endeavors, he can 
fully surrender unto the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Such persons 
are advised by the Lord from within to associate with devotees. By 
associating with devotees they naturally become inclined to render service 
312 
Kr�!J.a, the Supreme Personality of Godhead 
to the Personality of Godhead, and they immediately get all facilities from 
the Lord to advance in Kr�!la consciousness. The non-devotees, however, 
are very careful about preserving their material condition of life. Generally, 
therefore, such nondevotees do not come to worship the Supreme Per­
sonality of Godhead, but worship Lord Siva or other demigods for imme­
diate material profit. In the Bhagavad-gitii it is said, therefore, kiirzk§anta[l, 
karmarziirh siddhirh yajanta iha devatii[l,: the karmis, in order to achieve 
success within this material world, worship the various demigods. It is also 
stated by Lord Kr�!la that those who worship the demigods are not mature 
in their intelligence. The devotees of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, 
therefore, because of their strong attachment for Him, do not foolishly go 
to the demigods. 
Lord Kr�!la said to King Yudhi�thira: "My devotee is not deterred by 
any adverse conditions of life; he always remains firm and steady. There­
fore I give Myself to him, and I favor him so he can achieve the highest 
success in life." The mercy bestowed upon the tried devotee by the 
Supreme Personality is described as Brahman, which indicates that the 
greatness of that mercy can be compared only to the all-pervasive great­
ness. Brahman means unlimitedly great and unlimitedly expanding. That 
mercy is also described as parama, for it has no comparison within this 
material world, and it is also called siik§mam, very fine. The Lord's mercy 
upon the tried devotee is not only great and unlimitedly expansive, but it 
is of the finest quality of transcendental love between the devotee and the 
Lord. Such mercy is further described as cinmiitram, completely spiritual. 
The use of the word miitram indicates absolute spirituality, with no tinge 
of material qualities. That mercy is also called sat, eternal, and anantakam, 
unlimited. Since the devotee of the Lord is awarded such unlimited 
spiritual benefit, why should he worship the demigods? A devotee of Krwa 
does not worship Lord Siva or Brahma or any other subordinate demigod. 
He completely devotes himself to the transcendental loving service of the 
Supreme Personality of Godhead. 
Sukadeva Gosvami continued: "The demigods, headed by Lord Brahma 
and Lord Siva and including Lord lndra, Candra, Varu!la and others, are 
apt to become very quickly satisfied and very quickly angered by the good 
and ill behavior of their devotees. But this is not so with the Supreme 
Personality of Godhead, Vi�!J.u," This means that any living entity within 
this material world, including the demigods, is conducted by the three 
modes of material nature, and therefore the qualities of ignorance and 
passion are very prominent within the material world. Those devotees who 
take blessings from the demigods are also infected with the material quali-
Deliverance of Lord Siva 
313 
ties, especially passion and ignorance. Lord Sri Kr�!la has therefore stated 
in the Bhagavad-gitii that to take blessings from the demigods is less intelli­
gent because when one takes benedictions from the demigods, the results 
of such benedictions are temporary. It is easy to get material opulence by 
worshiping the demigods, but the result is sometimes disastrous. As such, 
the benedictions derived from demigods are appreciated by the less intelli­
gent class of men. Persons who derive benedictions from the demigods 
gradually become puffed up with material opulence and neglectful of 
their benefactors. 
Sukadeva Gosvami addressed King Parik�it thus: "My dear King, Lord 
Brahma, Lord Vi�!lu, and Lord Siva, the principal trio of the material 
creation, are able to bless or to curse anyone. Of this trio, Lord Brahma 
and Lord Siva become very easily satisfied, and at the same time they 
become very easily angered. When they are satisfied they give benedictions 
without any consideration, and when they are angry, they curse the 
devotee without any consideration. But Lord Vi�!lu is not like that. Lord 
Vi�!lu is very considerate. Whenever a devotee wants something from Lord 
Vi�!lu, Lord Viwu first of all considers whether such a benediction Will ul­
timately be good for the devotee. Lord Vi�!lu never bestows any benedic­
tion which will ultimately prove disastrous to the devotee, He is, by His tran­
scendental nature, always merciful; therefore, before giving any benedic­
tion, He considers whether it will prove beneficial for the devotee. Since the 
Supreme Personality of Godhead is always merciful, even when it appears 
that He has killed a demon, or even when He apparently becomes angry 
toward a devotee, His actions are always auspicious. The Supreme Person­
ality of GodhParl is therefore known as aU-good. Whatever He does is good. 
As for the benedictions given by demigods like Lord Siva, there is the 
following historical incident cited by great sages. Once, Lord Siva, after 
giving benediction to a demon named V rkasura, the son of Sakuni, was 
himself entrapped in a very dangerous position. Vrkasura was searching 
after a benediction and was trying to decide which of the three presiding 
deities to worship in order to get it. In the meantime he happened to meet 
the great sage Narada and consulted with him as to whom he should 
approach to achieve quick results from his austerity. He inquired, "Of the 
three deities, namely Lord Brahma, Lord Vi�!lu and Lord Siva, who is 
most quickly satisfied?" Narada could understand the plan of the demon, 
and he advised him, "You had better worship Lord Siva; then you will 
quickly get the desired result. Lord Siva is very quickly satisfied and very 
quickly dissatisfied also. So you try to satisfy Lord Siva." Narada also 
cited instances wherein demons like Rava!la and Ba!lasura were enriched 
314 
Kr��a, the Supreme Personality of Godhead 
with great opulences simply by satisfying Lord Siva with prayers. Because 
the great sage Narada was aware of the nature of the demon V�kasura, he 
did not advise him to approach Vi�p.u or Lord Brahma. Persons such as 
V �kasura who are situated in the material mode of ignorance, cannot 
stick to the worship of Vi�p.u. 
After receiving instruction from Narada, the demon V�kasura went to 
Kedaranatha. The pilgrimage site of Kedaranatha still exists near Kashmere. 
It is almost always covered by snow, but for part of the year, during the 
month of July, it is possible to see the deity, and devotees go there to offer 
their respects. Kedaranatha is for the devotees of Lord Siva. According to 
the Vedic principle, when something is offered to the deities to eat, it is 
offered in a fire. Therefore a fire sacrifice is necessary in all sorts of 
ceremonies. It is specifically stated in the siistras that gods are to be 
offered something to eat through the fire. The demon V�kasura therefore 
went to Kedaranatha and ignited a sacrificial fire to please Lord Siva. 
After igniting the fire in the name of Siva, he began to offer his own 
flesh, by cutting it from his body so as to please Lord Siva. Here is an 
instance of worship in the mode of ignorance. In the Bhagavad-gitii, 
different types of sacrifice are mentioned. Some sacrifices are in the mode 
of goodness, some are in the mode of passion, and some are in the mode 
of ignorance. There are different kinds of tapasya and worship because 
there are different kinds of people within this world. But the ultimate 
tapasya, Kr�p.a consciousness, is the topmost yoga and the topmost sacri­
fice. As confirmed in the Bhagavad-gitii, the topmost yoga is to think 
always of Lord Kr�p.a within the heart, and the topmost sacrifice is to 
perform the sankirtana-yajiia. 
In the Bhagavad-gitii it is stated that the worshipers of the demigods 
have lost their intelligence. As will be revealed later in this chapter, 
Vrkasura wanted to satisfy Lord Siva for a third-class materialistic objective, 
which was temporary and without real benefit. The asuras or persons 
within the mode of ignorance will accept such benedictions from the 
demigods. In complete contrast to this sacrifice in the modes of ignorance, 
the arcanii-viddhi process for worshiping Lord Vi�p.u or Kr�p.a is very 
simple. Lord Kf�p.a says in the Bhagavad-gitii that He accepts from His 
devotee even a little fruit, a flower or some water, which can be gathered 
by any person, poor or rich. Of course, those who are rich are not 
expected to offer only a little water, a little piece of fruit or a little leaf to 
the Lord. A rich man should offer according to his position, but if the 
devotee happens to be a very poor man the Lord will accept even the 
most meager offering. The worship of Lord Vi�p.u or Kr�p.a is very simple, 
Deliverance of Lord Siva 
315 
and it can be executed by anyone in this world. But worship in the mode 
of ignorance, as exhibited by Vrkasura, is not only very difficult and 
painful, but it is also a useless waste of time. Therefore Bhagavad-gitii says 
that the worshipers of the demigods are bereft of intelligence; their pro­
cess of worship is very difficult, and at the same time the result obtained 
is flickering and temporary. 
Although Vrkasura continued his sacrifice for six days, he was never­
theless unable to personally see Lord Siva, which was his objective; he 
wanted to see him face to face and ask him for a benediction. Here is 
another contrast between a demon and a devotee. A devotee is confident 
that whatever he offers to the Deity in full devotional service is accepted 
by the Lord, but a demon wants to see his worshipable deity face to face 
so that he can directly take the benediction. A devotee, however, does not 
worship Vi��u or Lord Kr��a for any benediction. Therefore a devotee is 
called akiima, free of desire, and a nondevotee is called sarva-kiima, or 
desirous of everything. On the seventh day, the demon V rkasura decided 
that he should cut off his head and offer it to satisfy Lord Siva. Thus he 
took bath in the nearby lake, and without drying his body and hair, he 
prepared to cut off his head. According to the Vedic system, an animal 
which is to be offered as a sacrifice has to be bathed first, and while the 
animal is wet he is sacrificed. When the demon was thus preparing to cut 
off his head, Lord Siva became very compassionate. This compassion, 
however, is a symp.tom of the quality of goodness. Lord Siva is called 
trilinga. Therefore his manifestation of the nature of compassion is a sign 
of the quality of goodness. This compassion, however, is present in every 
living entity. The compassion of Lord Siva was aroused because the demon 
was offering his flesh to the sacrificial fire. This is natural compassion. 
Even if a common man sees someone preparing to commit suicide, it is his 
duty to try to save him. He does so automatically. There is no need to 
appeal to him. Therefore when Lord Siva appeared from the fire to check 
the demon from suicide, it was not as a very great favor to him. 
The demon was saved from committing suicide by the touch of Lord 
Siva; his bodily injuries immediately healed, and his body became as it was 
before. Then Lord Siva told the demon, "My dear Vrkasura, you do not 
need to cut off your head. You can ask from me any benediction you like, 
and I shall fulfill your desire. I do not know why you wanted to cut off 
your head to satisfy me. I become satisfied even by an offering of a little 
water." Actually, according to the Vedic process, the Siva linga in the 
temple or the form of Lord Siva in the temple is worshiped simply by 
offering Ganges water because it is said that Lord Siva is greatly satisfied 
316 
Kr��a, the Supreme Personality of Godhead 
when Ganges water is poured upon his head. Generally, devotees offer 
Ganges water and the leaves of the bilva tree, which are especially meant 
for offering. to Lord Siva and the goddess Durga. The fruit of this tree also 
is offered to Lord Siva. Lord Siva assured v rkasura that . he becomes 
satisfied by a very simple process of worship. Why then was he so anxious 
to cut off his head, and why was he taking so much pain by cutting his 
body to pieces and offering it in the fire? There was no need of such severe 
penances. Anyway, out of compassion and sympathy, Lord Siva prepared 
to give him any benediction he liked. 
When the demon was offered this facility by Lord Siva, he asked for a 
very fearful and abominable benediction. The demon was very sinful, and 
sinful persons do not know what sort of benediction should be,asked from 
the deity. Therefore he asked Lord Siva to be benedicted with such power 
that as soon as he would touch anyone's head, immediately it would 
crack, and the man would die. The demons are described in the Bhagavad­
gitii as du§krtinas, or miscreants. Krti means very meritorious, but when 
du§, is added, it means abominable. Instead of surrendering unto the 
Supreme Personality of Godhead, the du§krtinas worship different demi­
gods in order to derive abominable material benefits. Sometimes such 
demons as material scientists discover lethal weapons. They cannot show 
their meritorious power by discovering something which can save man 
from death, but instead they discover weapons which accelerate the pro­
cess of death. Because Lord Siva is powerful enough to give any benedic­
tion, the demon could have asked of him something beneficial for human 
society, but for his personal interest he asked that anyone Whose head 
would be touched by his hand would at once die. 
Lord Siva could understand the motive of the demon, and he was very 
sorry that he had assured him whatever benediction he liked. He would 
not withdraw his promise, but he was very sorry in his heart that he was 
to offer him a benediction so dangerous to human society. The demons 
are described as du§krtinas, miscreants, because although they have brain 
power and merit, the merit and brain power are used for abominable 
activities. Sometimes, for example, the materialistic demons discover a 
lethal weapon. The scientific research for such a discovery certainly re­
quires a very good brain, but instead of discovering something beneficial 
to human society, they discover something to accelerate the death which 
is already assured to every man. Similarly, Vrkasura, instead of asking 
Lord Siva for something beneficial to human society, asked for some­
thing very dangerous to human society. Therefore Lord Siva felt sorry 
within himself. Devotees of the Personality of Godhead, however, never 
Deliverance of Lord Siva 
317 
ask any benediction from Lord Vi�pu or Kr�pa, and even if they ask some­
thing from the Lord, it is not at all dangerous for human society. That is 
the difference between the demons and the devotees, or the worshipers of 
Lord Siva and the worshipers of Lord Vi�pu. 
While Sukadeva Gosvami was narrating the history of v rkasura, he 
addressed Maharaja Parlk�it as Bhiirata, referring to King Parlk�it's birth 
in a family of devotees. Maharaja Parlk�it was saved by Lord Kr�pa while 
he was in his mother's womb. Similarly, he could have asked Lord Kr�pa 
to save him from the curse of the briihmarw, but he did not do so. The 
demon, however, wanted to become immortal by killing everyone with 
the touch of his hand. Lord Siva could understand this, but because he 
had promised, he gave him the benediction. 
The demon, however, being very sinful, immediately decided that he 
would use the benediction to kill Lord Siva and take away Gauri (Parvati) 
for his personal enjoyment. He immediately decided to place his hand 
on the head of Lord Siva. Thus Lord Siva was put into an awkward 
position because he was endangered by his own benediction to a demon. 
This is also another instance of a materialistic devotee's misusing the power 
derived from the demigods. 
Without further deliberation, the demon V rkasura immediately ap­
proached Lord Siva to place his hand on Lord Siva's head. Lord Siva was 
so afraid of him that his body trembled, and he began to flee from the 
land to the sky and from the sky to other planets until he reached the 
limits of the universe, above the higher planetary systems. Lord Siva fled 
from one place to another, but the demon Vrkasura continued to chase 
him. The predominating deities of other planets, such as Brahma, Indra 
and Candra, could not find any way to save Lord Siva from the impending 
danger. Wherever Lord Siva went, they remained silent. 
At last Lord Siva approached Lord Vi�pu, who is situated within this 
universe in the planet known as Svetadvipa. 
Svetadvipa is the local 
V aikuptha planet beyond the jurisdiction of the influence of external 
energy. Lord Vi�pu in His all-pervasive feature remains everywhere, but 
wherever He remains personally is the Vaikuptha atmosphere. In the 
Bhagavad-gitii it is stated that the Lord remains within the heart of all 
living entities. As such, the Lord remains within the heart of many low­
born living entities, but that does not mean that He is low-born. Wherever 
He remains is transformed into V aikuptha. So the planet within this 
universe known as Svetadvipa is also V aikupthaloka. It is said in the 
siistras that residential quarters within the forest are in the mode of 
goodness, residential quarters in big cities, towns and villages are in the 
318 
Kr��a, the Supreme Personality of Godhead 
mode of passion, and residential quarters in an atmosphere wherein 
indulgence in the four sinful activities of illicit sex, intoxication, meat­
eating and gambling predominate are in the mode of ignorance. But 
residential quarters in a temple of Vi�:pu, the Supreme Lord, are in 
Vaiku:ptha. It doesn't matter where the temple is situated, but the temple 
itself, wherever it may be, is V aiku:ptha. Similarly, the Svetadvipa planet, 
although within the material jurisdiction, is V aiku:ptha. 
Lord Siva finally entered Svetadvipa V aiku:ptha. In Svetadvipa there 
are great saintly persons who are completely freed from the envious 
nature of the material world and are beyond the jurisdiction of the four 
principles of material activities, namely, religiousness, economic develop­
ment, sense gratification and liberation. Anyone who enters into that 
V aiku:ptha planet never comes back again to this material world. Lord 
Naraya:pa is celebrated as a lover of His devotees, and as soon as He 
understood that Lord Siva was in great danger, He appeared as a brahma­
ciiri and personally approached Lord Siva to receive him from a distant 
place. The Lord appeared as a perfect brahmaciiri, with a belt around His 
waist, sacred thread, deerskin, a brahmaciiri stick and raudra beads. (Raudra 
beads are different from tulasi beads. Raudra beads are used by the devo­
tees of Lord Siva.) Dressed as a brahmaciiri, Lord Naraya:pa stood before 
Lord Siva. The shining effulgence emanating from His body attracted not 
only Lord Siva but also the demon Vrkasura. 
Lord Naraya:pa offered his respects and obeisances unto V rkasura, just 
to attract his sympathy and attention. Thus checking the demon, the Lord 
addressed him as follows: "My dear son of Sakuni, you appear to be very 
tired, as if coming from a very distant place. What is your purpose? Why 
have you come so far? I see that you are very tired and fatigued, so I 
request you to take a little rest. You should not unnecessarily tire your 
body. Everyone greatly values his body because with this body only can 
one fulfill all the desires of one's mind. We should not, therefore, un­
necessarily give trouble to this body." 
The brahmaciiri addressed Vrkasura as the son of Sakuni just to convince 
him that He was known to his father' Sakuni. v rkasura then took the 
brahmaciiri to be someone known to his family, and therefore the brahma­
ciiri's sympathetic words appealed to him. Before the demon could argue 
that he had no time to take rest, the Lord began to inform him about the 
importance of the body, and the demon was convinced. Any man, 
especially a demon, takes his body to be very important. Thus V rkasura 
became convinced about the importance of his body. 
Then, just to pacify the demon, the brahmaciiri told him, "My dear lord, 
Deliverance of Lord Siva 
319 
if you think that you can disclose the mission for which you have taken 
the trouble to come here, maybe I shall be able to help you so that your 
purpose will be easily served." Indirectly, the Lord informed him that 
because the Lord is the Supreme Brahman, certainly He would be able to 
adjust the awkward situation created by Lord Siva. 
The demon was greatly pacified by the sweet words of Lord Narayapa 
in the form of a brahmaciiri, and at last he disclosed all that had happened 
in regard to the benediction offered by Lord Siva. The Lord replied to the 
demon as follows: "I myself cannot believe that Lord Siva has in truth 
given you such a benediction. As far as I know, Lord Siva is not in a sane 
mental condition. He had a quarrel With his father-in-law Dak�a, and he 
has been cursed to become a pisiica (ghost). Thus he has become the 
leader of the ghosts and hobgoblins. Therefore I cannot put any faith in 
his words. But if you have faith still in the words of Lord Siva, my dear 
king of the demons, then why don't you make an experiment by putting 
your hand on your head? If the benediction proves false, then you can 
immediately kill this liar, Lord Siva, so that in the future he will not dare 
to give out false benedictions." 
In this way, by Lord Narayapa's sweet words and by the expansion of 
His superior illusion, the demon became bewildered, and he actually forgot 
the power of Lord Siva and his benediction. He was thus very easily per­
suaded to put his hand on his own head. As soon as the demon did that, 
his head cracked, as if struck by thunder, and he immediately died. The 
demigods from heaven began to shower flowers on Lord Narayapa, praising 
Him with all glories and all thanksgiving, and they offered their obeisances 
to the Lord. On the death of V rkasura, all the denizens in the higher 
planetary systems, namely, the demigods, the pitiis, the Gandharvas and 
the inhabitants of J analoka, began to shower flowers on the Personality of 
Godhead. 
Thus Lord Vi§pu in the form of a brahmaciiri released Lord Siva from 
the impending danger and saved the whole situation. Lord Narayapa then 
informed Lord Siva that this demon, V rkasura, was killed as the result of 
his sinful activities. He was especially sinful and offensive because he 
wanted to experiment on his own master, Lord Siva. Lord Narayapa then 
told Lord Siva, "My dear lord, a person who commits an offense to great 
souls cannot continue to exist. He becomes vanquished by his own sinful 
activities, and this is certainly true of this demon, who has committed such 
an offensive act against you." 
Thus, by the grace of the Supreme Personality of Godhead Narayapa, 
who is transcendental to all material qualities, Lord Siva was saved from 
320 
Kr�!13' the Supreme Personality of Godhead 
being killed by a demon. Anyone who hears this history with faith and 
devotion certainly becomes liberated from material entanglement as well 
as from the clutches of his enemies. 
Thus ends the Bhaktivedanta purport of the Second Volume, Thirty­
third Chapter, of Kr�pa, "Deliverance of Lord Siva." 
34 I The Superexcellent Power of Kr��a 
Long, long ago, there was an assembly of great sages on the bank of the 
River 
Sarasvati, 
and they performed a great sacrifice of the name 
Satrayajiia. In such assemblies, the great sages present usually discuss Vedic 
subject matters and philosophical topics, and in this particular meeting the 
following question was raised: The three predominating deities of this 
material world, namely, Lord Brahma, Lord Vi��u and Lord Siva, are 
directing all the affairs of the this cosmos, but who among them is the 
Supreme? After much discussion on this question, the great sage named 
Bhfgu, who is the son of Lord Brahma, was deputed to test all three 
predominating deities and report to the assembly as to who is the greatest. 
Being thus deputed, the great sage Bhrgumuni first of all went to his 
father's residence in Brahmaloka. The three deities are the controllers of 
the three material qualities, namely the qualities of goodness, passion and 
ignorance. The plan decided upon by the sages was for Bhrgu to test which 
of the predominating deities possesses the quality of goodness in full. 
Therefore, when Bhfgumuni reached his father, Lord Brahma, because he 
wanted to test whether he had the quality of goodness, he purposely did 
not offer his respects to his father either by offering obeisances or by 
offering prayers. It is the duty of a son or a disciple to offer respects and 
recite suitable prayers when he approaches his father or spiritual master. 
But Bhfgumuni purposefully failed to offer respects, just to see Lord 
Brahma's reaction to this negligence. Lord Brahma was very angry at his 
son's impudency, and he showed signs which definitely proved this to be 
so. He was even prepared to condemn Bhrgu by cursing him, but because 
Bhfgu was his son, Lord Brahma controlled his anger with his great intelli­
gence. This means that although the quality of passion was prominent in 
Lord Brahma, he had the power to control it. Lord Brahma's anger and his 
controlling his anger are likened to fire and water. Water is produced from 
321 
322 
Kr��a, the Supreme Personality of Godhead 
fire, but at the same time, fire can be extinguished with water. Similarly, 
although Lord Brahma was very angry due to his quality of passion, he 
could still control his passion because Bhrgumuni was his son. 
After testing Lord Brahma, Bhfgumuni went directly to the planet 
Kailasa, where Lord Siva resides. Bhrgumuni happened to be Lord Siva's 
brother. Therefore, as soon as Bhrgumuni approached, Lord Siva became 
very glad and personally rose to embrace him. But when Lord Siva 
approached, Bhfgumuni refused to embrace him. "My dear brother," he 
said, "you are always very impure. Because you smear your body with 
ashes, you are therefore not very clean. Please do not touch me." When 
Bhrgumuni refused to embrace his brother, saying that Lord Siva was very 
impure, the latter became very angry with him. It is said that an offense 
can be committed either with the body, with the mind or by speech. 
Bhfgumuni's first offense, committed towards Lord Brahma, was an 
offense with the mind. His second offense, committed towards Lord 
Siva by insulting him, criticizing him for unclean habits, was an offense 
by speech. Because the quality of ignorance is prominent in Lord Siva, 
when he heard Bhfgu 's insult, his eyes immediately became red with 
anger. With uncontrollable rage, he took up his trident and prepared to 
kill Bhfgumuni. At that time, Lord Siva's wife, Parvati, was present. 
Her personality is a mixture of the three qualities, and therefore she is 
called Trigu�amayi. In this case, she saved the situation by evoking Lord 
Siva's quality of goodness. She fell down at the feet of her husband, and 
with her sweet words she talked him out of killing Bhrgumuni. 
After being saved from the anger of Lord Siva, Bhfgumuni went 
directly to the planet Svetadvipa, where Lord Vi��u was lying on a bed of 
flowers, accompanied by His wife, the goddess of fortune, who was 
engaged in massaging His lotus feet. There Bhfgumuni purposely committed 
the greatest sin by offending Lord Vi��u by his bodily activities. The first 
offense committed by Bhfgumuni was mental, the second offense was 
vocal, and the third offense was corporal. These different offenses are 
progressively greater in degree. An offense committed within the mind is 
a positive offense, the same offense, committed verbally is comparitively 
more grave, and when committed by bodily action it is superlative in 
offensiveness. So Bhfgumuni committed the greatest offense by touching 
the chest of the Lord with his foot in the presence of the goddess of 
fortune. Of course, Lord Vi��u is all-merciful. He did not become angry 
at the activities of Bhfgumuni because Bhrgumuni was a great briihmap.a. 
A briihmap.a is to be excused even if he sometimes commits an offense, 
and Lord Vi�v.u set the example. Yet it is said that from the time of this 
The Superexcellent Power of KH!ia 
323 
incident, the goddess of fortune, Lak�mi, has not been very favorably 
disposed towards the briihmarws, and therefore because the goddess of 
fortune witholds her benedictions from them, the briihmartas are generally 
very poor. Bhfgumuni's touching the chest of Lord Vi�pu with his foot 
was certainly a great offense, but Lord Vi�pu is so great that He did not 
care. The so-called briihmartas of the Kali-yuga are sometimes very proud 
that they can touch the chest of Lord V�pu with their feet. But when 
Bhfgumuni touched the chest of Lord V�pu with his feet, it was different 
because although it was the greatest offense, Lord Vi�pu, being greatly 
magnanimous, did not take it very seriously. 
Instead of being angry or cursing Bhrgumuni, Lord Vi�pu immediately 
got up from His bed along with His wife, the goddess of fortune, and 
offered respectful obeisances to the briihmarta. He addressed Bhrgumuni 
as follows: "My dear briihmafLa, it is a great blessing for Me that you have 
come here. Please, therefore, sit down on this cushion for a few minutes. 
My dear briihmarta, I am very sorry that when you first entered I could 
not receive you properly. It was a great offense on My part, and I beg you 
to pardon Me. You are so pure and great that the water which washes your 
feet can purify even the places of pilgrimage. Therefore, I request you to 
purify the Vaikuptha planet where I live with My associates. My dear 
father, 0 great sage, I know that your feet are very soft, like a lotus flower, 
and that My chest is as hard as a thunderbolt. I am therefore afraid that 
you may have felt some pain by touching My chest with your feet. Let Me 
therefore touch your feet to relieve the pain you have suffered." Lord 
Vi�pu then began to massage the feet of Bhfgumuni. 
The Lord continued to address Bhrgumuni. "My dear lord," He said, 
"My chest has now become sanctified because of the touch of your feet, 
and I am now assured that the goddess of fortune, Lak�mi, will be very 
glad to live there perpetually." Another name for Lak�mi is Caficala. She 
does not stay in one place for a long time. Therefore, we see that a rich 
man's family sometimes becomes poor after a few generations, and some­
times we see that a poor man's family becomes very rich. Lak�mi, the 
goddess of fortune, is Caficala in this material world, whereas in the 
Vaikuptha planets she eternally lives at the lotus feet of the Lord. Because 
Lak�mi is famous as Caficala, Lord Narayapa indicated that she might not 
have been living perpetually by His chest, but because His chest had been 
touched by the feet of Bhrgumuni, it was now sanctified, and there was no 
chance that the goddess of fortune would leave. Bhrgumuni, however, 
could understand his position and that of the Lord, and he was struck with 
wonder at the behavior of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Because 
324 
Kr��a, the Supreme Personality of Godhead 
of his gratitude, his voice choked up, and he was not able to reply to the 
words of the Lord. Tears glided from his eyes, and he could not say any­
thing. He simply stood silently before the Lord. 
After testing Lord Brahma, Lord Siva and Lord Vi�tJ.u, Bhrgumuni re­
turned to the assembly of great sages on the bank of the River Sarasvati 
and described his experience. After hearing him with great attention, the 
sages concluded that of all the predominating deities, certainly Vi�tJ.U is 
situated in the mode of goodness in the highest degree. In the Srimad­
Bhagavatam, these great sages are described as brahma-vadinam. Brahma­
vadinam means those who talk about the Absolute Truth but have not 
yet come to a conclusion. Generally brahma-vadi refers to the imper­
sonalists or to those who are students of the Vedas. It is to be understood, 
therefore, that all the gathered sages were serious students of Vedic litera­
ture, but had not come to definite conclusions as to who is the Supreme 
Absolute Personality of Godhead. 
After hearing of Bhfgumuni's experience in meeting all three predomi­
nating deities, Lord Siva, Lord Brahma, and Lord Vi�tJ.U, the sages con­
cluded that Lord Vi�tm is the Supreme Truth, the Personality of Godhead. 
It is said in the Srimad-Bhagavatam that after hearing the details from 
Bhfgumuni, the sages were astonished because although Lord Brahma and 
Lord Siva were immediately agitated, Lord Vi�tJ.U, in spite of being kicked 
by Bhfgumuni, was not agitated in the least. The example is given that 
small lamps may become agitated by a little breeze, but the greatest lamp 
or the greatest illuminating source, the sun, is never moved, even by the 
greatest hurricane. One's greatness has to be estimated by one's ability to 
tolerate provoking situations. The sages gathered on the bank of the River 
Sarasvati concluded that if anyone wants actual peace and freedom from 
all fearfulness, he should take shelter of the lotus feet of Visnu. If Lord 
Brahma and Lord Siva lost their peaceful attitude upon a slight provoca­
tion, how could they maintain the peace and tranquility of their devotees? 
As for Lord Vi�tJ.U, however; it is stated in the Bhagavad-gita that anyone 
who accepts Lord Vi�tJ.U or Kr�!la as the supreme friend attains the highest 
perfection of peaceful life. 
The sages thus concluded that by following the principles of vai§r-ava­
dharma, one becomes actually perfect. But if one follows all the religious 
principles of a particular sect and does not become advanced in under­
standing the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Vi�tJ.U, all such labor of 
love is fruitless. To execute religious principles means to come to the 
platform of perfect knowledge. If one comes to the platform of perfect 
knowledge, then he will be disinterested in material affairs. Perfect know-
The Superexcellent Power of KH!J.a 
325 
ledge means to know one's own self and to know the Supreme Self. The 
Supreme Self and the individual self, although one in quality, are different 
in quantity. This analytical understanding of knowledge is perfect. Simply 
to understand, "I am not matter; I am spirit," is not perfect knowledge. The 
real religious principle is devotional service, or bhakti. This is confirmed in 
the Bhagavad-gitii. Lord Kr�!la says, "Give up all other religious principles 
and simply surrender unto Me." Therefore, the term dharma applies only 
to the vai§"[tava-dharma or bhagavad-dharma, following which all other good 
qualities and advancements in life are automatically achieved. 
The highest perfectional knowledge is to know the Supreme Lord. He 
cannot be understood by any process of religion other than devotional 
service; therefore, the immediate result of perfect knowledge is achieved 
by executing devotional service. After attainment of knowledge, one 
becomes disinterested in the material world. This is not because of dry 
philosophical speculation. The devotees become disinterested in the mate­
rial world, not simply because of theoretical understanding, but practical 
experience. When a devotee realizes the effect of association with the 
Supreme Lord, he naturally hates the association of so-called society, 
friendship and love. This detachment is not dry, but is due to achieving a 
higher status of life by relishing transcendental mellows. It is further stated 
in the Srimad-Bhiigavatam that after attainment of such knowledge and 
detachment from material sense gratification, one's advancement in the 
eight opulences attained by mystic yoga practice, namely the ar.imii, 
laghimii and priipti siddhis, etc., are also achieved without separate effort. 
The perfect example is Maharaja Ambari�a. He was not a mystic yogi but 
was a great devotee, yet in a disagreement with Maharaja Ambari�a, the 
great mystic Durvasa was defeated in the presence of his devotional atti­
tude. In other words, a devotee does not need to practice the mystic yoga 
system to achieve power. The power is behind him by the grace of the 
Lord, just as when a small child is surrendered to a powerful father, all the 
powers of the father are behind him. 
When a person becomes famous as a devotee of the Lord, his reputa­
tion is never to be extinguished. Lord Caitanya, when discoursing with 
Ramananda Raya, questioned, "What is the greatest fame?" Ramananda 
Raya replied that to be known as a pure devotee of Lord Kr�p.a is the 
perfect fame. The conclusion, therefore, is that Viwu-dharma, or the 
religion of devotional service unto the Supreme Personality of Godhead, is 
meant for persons who are thoughtful. By proper utilization of thoughtful­
ness, one comes to the stage of thinking of the Supreme Personality of 
Godhead. By thinking of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, one 
326 
Kr��a, the Supreme Personality of Godhead 
becomes free from the contamination of the faulty association of the 
material world, and thus one becomes peaceful. The world is in a disturbed 
condition because of a scarcity of such peaceful devotees in human society. 
Unless one is a devotee, one cannot be equal to all living entities. A 
devotee is equally disposed towards the animals, the human beings and all 
living entities because he sees every living entity as a part and parcel of the 
Supreme Lord. In the lsopani§ad it is clearly stated that one who has come 
to the stage of seeing all living beings equally does not hate anyone or 
favor anyone. The devotee does not hanker to possess more than he 
requires. Devotees are therefore akiiicana; in any condition of life a 
devotee is satisfied. It is said that a devotee is evenminded whether he is in 
hell or in heaven. A devotee is callous to all subjects other than his engage­
ment in devotional service. This mode of life is the highest perfectional 
stage, from which one can be elevated to the spiritual world, back home, 
back to Godhead. The devotees of the Supreme Personality of Godhead 
are especially attracted by the highest material quality, goodness, and the 
qualified briihmafla is the symbolic representation of this goodness. There­
fore, a devotee is attached to the brahminical stage of life. He is not very 
much interested in passion or ignorance, although these qualities also 
emanate from the Supreme Lord, Vi�pu. In the Srimad-Bhiigavatam the 
devotees are described as nipufla-buddhaya[t, which means that they are 
the most intelligent class of men. Uninfluenced by attachment or hatred, 
the devotee lives very peacefully and is not agitated by the influence of 
passion and ignorance. 
It may be questioned here why a devotee should be attached to the qual­
ity of goodness in the material world if he is transcendental to all material 
qualities. The answer is that there are different kinds of people existing in 
the modes of material nature. Those who are in the mode of ignorance are 
called riik§asas, those in the mode of passion are called asuras, and those in 
the mode of goodness are called suras, or demigods. Under the direction of 
the Supreme Lord, these three classes of men are created by material 
nature, but those who are in the mode of goodness have a greater chance 
to be elevated to the spiritual world, back home, back to Godhead. 
Thus all the sages who assembled on the bank of the River Sarasvati to 
try to determine who is the supreme predominating Deity became freed 
from all doubts about Vi�pu worship. All of them thereafter engaged in 
devotional service, and thus they achieved the desired result and went back 
to Godhead. 
Those who are actually anxious to become liberated from material 
entanglement would do better to accept at once the conclusion given by 
The Superexcellent Power of Kr��a 
327 
Sri Sukadeva Gosvami in the beginning of the Srimad-Bhiigavatam. It is 
said there that hearing the Srimad-Bhiigavatam is extremely conducive to 
liberation because it is spoken by Sukadeva Gosvami. The same fact is 
again confirmed by Siita Gosvami: if anyone who is ,travelling aimlessly 
within this material world cares to hear the nectarean words spoken by 
Sukadeva Gosvami, certainly he will come to the right conclusion; simply 
by discharging devotional service to the Supreme Personality of Godhead 
he will be able to stop the fatigue of migrating.from one material body to 
another perpetually. In other words, by proper hearing one will become 
fixed in loving devotional service to Viwu. He will certainly be able to get 
relief from this material journey of life, and the process is very simple. One 
has to give aural reception to the sweet words spoken by Sukadeva Gosvami 
in the form of Srimad-Bhiigavatam. 
Another conclusion is that we should never consider the demigods, even 
Lord Siva and Lord Brahma, to be on an equal level with Lord Vi�p.u. If 
we do this, then according to Padma Puriip,a, we immediately become 
atheists. In the Vedic literature known as Harivarhsa it is also stated that 
only the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Vi��u, is to be worshiped. The 
Hare Kr��a mahiimantra, or any such Vi�p.u mantra, is always to be 
chanted. In the Second Canto of Srimad-Bhiigavatam, Lord Brahma says, 
"Both Lord Siva and myself are engaged by the Supreme Personality of 
Godhead to act in different capacities under His direction." In the 
Caitanya-caritiimrta it is also stated that the only master is Kr�p.a, and 
everyone in all categories of life are servants of Kr�p.a only. 
In the Bhagavad-gitii it is confirmed by the Lord that there is no truth 
superior to Kf�p.a. Sukadeva Gosvami also, in order to draw attention to 
the fact that among all Vi§!m-tattva forms, Lord Kf�p.a is one hundred 
percent the Supreme Personality of Godhead, narrated the story of an 
incident which took place when Lord Kr�p.a was present. 
Once upon a time, a briihmap,a's wife gave birth to a child. Unfortunately, 
however, just after being born and touching the ground, the child imme­
diately died. The briihmarta father took the dead child and went directly 
to Dvaraka to the palace of the king. The briihmap,a was very upset because 
of the untimely death of the child in the presence of his young father and 
mother. Thus his mind became very disturbed. Formerly, when there were 
responsible kings, up to the time of Dvapara-yuga, when Lord Krwa was 
present, the king was liable to be blamed for the untimely death of a 
child in the presence of his parents. Similarly, such responsibility was 
there during the time of Lord Ramacandra. As we have explained in the 
First Canto of Srimad-Bhiigavatam, the king was so responsible for the 
328 
Kr��a, the Supreme Personality of Godhead 
comforts of the citizens that he was to see that there was not even 
excessive heat or cold. Although there was no fault on the part of the king, 
the briihmarta whose child had died immediately went to the palace door 
and began to accuse the king as follows. 
"The present King, Ugrasena, is envious of the briihmartas!" The exact 
word used in this connection is briihma-dvi§a�. One who is envious of the 
Vedas or one who is envious of a qualified briihmarta or the briihmarta 
caste is called brahma-dvit. So the King was accused of being brahma-dvit. 
He was also accused of being satha-dhi, falsely intelligent. The executive 
head of a state must be very intelligent to see to the comforts of the citi­
zens, but, according to the briihmarta the king was not at all intelligent, 
although he was occupying the royal throne. Therefore he also called him 
lubdha, which means greedy. In other words, a king or an executive head of 
state should not occupy the exalted post of presidency or kingship if he is 
greedy and self-interested. But it is natural that an executive head becomes 
self-interested when he is attached to material enjoyment. Therefore, 
another word used here is vi§ayiitmana�. 
The briihmarta also accused the king of being k§atra-bandhu, which 
refers to a person born in the family of k§atriyas or the royal order who is 
without the qualifications of a royal personality. A king should protect 
brahminical culture and should be very alert to the welfare of his citizens; 
he should not be greedy due to attachment to material enjoyment. If a 
person with no qualifications represents himself as a k§atriya of the royal 
order, he is not called a k§atriya, but a k§atra-bandhu. Similarly, if a person 
is born of a briihmarta father but has no brahminical qualification, he is 
called brahma-bandhu, or dvija-bandhu. This means that a briihmarta or a 
k§atriya is not accepted simply by birth. One has to qualify himself for 
the particular position; only then is he accepted as a briihmarta or a k§atriya. 
Thus the briihmarta accused the King that his newly born baby was dead 
due to the disqualifications of the king. The briihmarta took it most 
unnaturally, and therefore he held the king to be responsible. We also find 
in Vedic history that if a k§atriya king were irresponsible, sometimes a 
consulting board of briihmartas maintained by the monarchy would de­
throne him. Considering all these points, it appears that the post of 
monarch in the Vedic civilization is a very responsible one. 
The briihmarta therefore said, "No one should offer respects or worship 
to a king whose only business is envy. Such a king spends his time either 
hunting and killing animals in the forest or killing citizens for criminal acts 
He has no self-control and possesses bad character. If such a king is wor­
shiped or honored by the citizens, the citizens will never be happy. They 
will always remain poor, full of anxieties and aggrievement, and always 
The Superexcellent Power of Kr��a 
329 
unhappy." Although in modern politics the post of monarch is abolished, 
the president is not held responsible for the comforts of the citizens. In 
this age of Kali, the executive head of a state somehow or other gets 
votes and is elected to an exalted post, but the condition of the citizens 
continues to be full of anxiety, distress, unhappiness, and dissatisfaction. 
The briihma!!-a's second child was also born dead, and the third also. He 
had nine children, and each of them was born dead, and each time he 
came to the gate of the palace to accuse the King. When the briihmarw came 
to accuse the King of Dvaraka for the ninth time, Arjuna happened to be 
present with Kr§�a. On hearing that a briihmaf!-a was accusing the King of 
not properly protecting him, Arjuna became inquisitive and approached 
the briihmaf!-a. He said, "My dear briihmaf!-a, why do you say that there 
are no proper k§atriyas to protect the citizens of your country? Is there 
not even someone who can pretend to be a k§atriya, who can carry a bow 
and arrow at least to make a show of protection? Do you think that all 
the royal personalities in this country simply engage in performing sacrifices 
with the briihmaf!-aS but have no chivalrous power?" Thus Arjuna indicated 
that 
k§atriyas 
should not sit back comfortably and engage only in 
performing Vedic rituals. Rather, they must be very chivalrous in protect­
ing the citizens. Briihmaf!-as, being engaged in spiritual activities, are not 
expected to do anything which requires physical endeavor. Therefore, 
they need to be· protected . by the k§atriyas so that they will not be 
disturbed in the execution of their higher occupational duties. 
"If the briihmaf!-aS feel unwanted separation from their wives and 
children," Arjuna continued, "and the k§atriya kings do not take care of 
them, then such k§atriyas are to be considered no more than stage 
players. In dramatical performances in the theater, an actor may play 
the part of a king, but no one expects any benefits from such a make­
believe king. Similarly, if the king or the executive head of a state cannot 
give protection to the head of the social structure, he is considered merely 
a bluffer. Such executive heads simply live for their own livelihood while 
occupying exalted posts as chiefs .of state. My lord, I promise that I shall 
give protection to your children, and if I am unable to do so, then I shall 
enter into blazing fire so that the sinful contamination which has infected 
me will be counteracted." 
Upon hearing Arjuna speak in this way, the briihmarw replied, "My dear 
Arjuna, Lord Balarama is present, but He could not give protection to my 
children. Lord Kr§!la is also present, but He also could not give them 
protection. There are also many other heroes, such as Pradyumna and 
Aniruddha, carrying bows and arrows, but they could not protect my 
children." The briihmarz.a directly hinted that Arjuna could not do that 
(-
330 
Kr�!la, the Supreme Personality of Godhead 
which was impossible for the Supreme Personality of Godhead. He felt 
that Arjuna was promising something beyond his power. The briihma!la. 
said, "I consider your promise to be like that of an inexperienced child. I 
cannot put my faith in your promise." 
Arjuna then understood that the briihma!la had lost all faith in the 
k§atriya kings. Therefore, to encourage him, Arjuna spoke as if criticizing 
even his friend, Lord Kr�!J.a. While Lord Kr�!la and others were listening, he 
specifically attacked Kr�!la by saying, "My dear briihmar-a, I am neither 
Sankar�a!la nor Kr�!la nor one of Kr�!la 's sons like Pradyumna or 
Aniruddha. My name is Arjuna, and I carry the bow known as Gapflva. 
You cannot insult me because I have satisfied even Lord Siva by my 
prowess when we were both hunting in the forest. I had a fight with Lord 
Siva, who appeared before me as a hunter, and when I satisfied him by my 
prowess, he gave me the weapon known as pasupatiistra. Do not doubt my 
chivalry. I shall bring back your sons even if I have to fight with death 
personified." When the briihmar-a was assured by Arjuna in such exalted 
words, he somehow or other was convinced, and thus he returned home. 
When the briihma!la's wife was to give birth to another child, the 
briihmar-a began to chant, "My dear Arjuna, please come now and save my 
child." 
After 
hearing him, Arjuna immediately prepared himself by 
touching sanctified water and uttering holy mantras to protect his bows 
and arrows from danger. He specifically took the arrow which was pre­
sented to him by Lord Siva, and while going out, he began to remember 
Lord Siva and his great favor. In this way, he appeared in front of the 
maternity home, equipped with his bow, known as Ga!J.f!va, and with 
various other weapons. 
It appears that Arjuna did not leave Dvaraka because he had to fulfill 
his promise to the briihmar-a. He was called at night when the briihma!la's 
wife was to give birth to the child. While going to the maternity home to 
attend to the delivery case of the briihmar-a's wife, Arjuna remembered 
Lord Siva, and not his friend Kr�!la; he thought that since Kr�!la could not 
give protection to the briihmar-a, it was better to take shelter of Lord 
Siva. This is another instance of how a person takes shelter of the demigods. 
This is explained in the Bhagavad-gitii: kiimais tais tair hrta-jniinii�: a 
person who loses his intelligence because of greediness and lust forgets 
the Supreme Personality of Godhead and takes shelter of the demigods. 
Of course, Arjuna was not an ordinary living entity, but because of his 
friendly dealings with Kr�!J.a, he thought that Kr�!la was unable to give 
protection to the briihmar-a and that he would do better to remember Lord 
Siva. Later on it was proved that Arjuna's taking shelter of Lord Siva 
The Superexcellent Power of Kr�tta 
331 
instead of Kr�tta was not at all successful. Arjuna, however, did his best by 
chanting different mantras, and he took up his bow to guard the maternity 
home from all directions. 
The briihmarw's wife delivered a male child, and as usual the child began 
to cry. But suddenly, within a few minutes, both the child and Arjuna's 
arrows disappeared in the sky. It appeared that the briihmacw's house was 
near Kr�tta's residence and that Lord Kr�tta was enjoying everything that 
was taking place apparently in defiance of His authority. It was He who 
played the trick of taking away the briihmana 's baby as well as the arrows, 
including the one given by Lord Siva, of which Arjuna was so proud. Tad 
bhavati alpamedhasiim: less intelligent men take shelter of the demigods 
due to bewilderment and are satisfied with the benefits they award. 
In the presence of Lord Kr�tta and others, the briihma!la began to accuse 
Arjuna: "Everyone see my foolishness! I put my faith in the words of 
Arjuna, who is impotent and who is expert only in false promises. How 
foolish I was to believe Arjuna. He promised to protect my child when 
even Pradyumna, Aniruddha, Lord Balarama and Lord Kr�tta failed. If 
such great personalities could not protect my child, then who can do so? I 
therefore condemn Arjuna for his false promise, and I also condemn his 
celebrated bow Gatt9lva and his impudency in declaring himself greater 
than Lord Balarama, Lord Kr�!J.a, Pradyumna and Aniruddha. No one can 
save my child, for he has already been transferred to another planet. Due 
to sheer foolishness only, Arjuna thought that he could bring back my 
child from another planet." 
Thus condemned by the briihma'(la, Arjuna empowered himself with a 
mystic yoga perfection so that he could travel to any planet to find the 
briihma'{la's baby. It seems that Arjuna had mastered the mystic yogic 
power by which yogis can travel to any planet they desire. He first of all 
wnet to the planet known as Y amaloka, where the superintendent of 
death, Yamaraja, lives. There he searched for the briihma'{la's baby, but he 
was unable to find him. He then immediately went to the planet where the 
King of heaven, lndra, lives. When he was unable to find the baby there, 
he went to the planets of the fire demigods, Nairrti, and then to the moon 
planet. Then he went to Vayu and to Varupaloka. When he was unable to 
find the baby in those planets, he went down to the Rasatala planet, the 
lowest of the planetary systems. After traveling to all these different 
planets, he finally went to Brahmaloka, where even the mystic yogis 
cannot go. By the grace of Lord Kr§pa, Arjuna had that power, and he went 
above the heavenly planets to Brahmaloka. When he was unable to find the 
baby even after searching all possible planets, he then attempted to throw 
332 
Kr��a, the Supreme Personality of Godhead 
himself into a fire, as he had promised the briihmar-a if unable to bring 
back his baby. Lord Kr��a, however, was very kind toward Arjuna because 
Arjuna happened to be the most intimate friend of the Lord. Lord Kr�p.a 
persuaded Arjuna not to enter the fire in disgrace. Kr��a indicated that 
since Arjuna was His friend, if he were to enter the fire in hopelessness, 
indirectly it would be a blemish on Him. Lord Kr�p.a therefore checked 
Arjuna, assuring him that He would find the baby. He told Arjuna, "Do 
not foolishly commit suicide." 
After addressing Arjuna in this way, Lord Kr�p.a called for His transcen­
dental chariot. He mounted it along with Arjuna and began to proceed 
north. Lord Krwa, the all-powerful Personality of Godhead, could have 
brought the child back without effort, but we should always remember 
that He was playing the part of a human being. As a human being has to 
endeavor to achieve certain results, so Lord Kr�p.a, like an ordinary human 
being, or like His friend Arjuna, left Dvaraka to bring back the briihmar-a's 
baby. By appearing in human society and exhibiting His pastimes as a 
human being, Kr�p.a definitely showed that there was not a single person­
ality greater than He. "God is great." That is the definition of the Supreme 
Personality of Godhead. So at least within this material world, while He 
was present, Kr�p.a proved that there was no greater personality within the 
umverse. 
Seated on His chariot with Arjuna, Kr�p.a began to proceed north, 
crossing over many planetary systems. These are described in the Srimad­
Bhiigavatam as sapta-dvipa. Dvipa means island. All these planets are 
sometimes described in the Vedic literature as dvipas. The planet on which 
we are living is called Jambiidvipa. Outer space is taken as a great ocean of 
air, and within that great ocean of air there are many islands, which are 
the different planets. In each and every planet there are oceans also. In 
some of the planets, the oceans are of salt water, and in some of them there 
are oceans of milk. In others there are oceans of liquor, and in others there 
are oceans of ghee or oil. There are different kinds of mountains also. Each 
and every planet has a different type of atmosphere. 
Kr�p.a passed over all these planets and reached the covering of the 
universe. This covering is described in the Srimad-Bhiigavatam as great 
darkness. This material world as a whole is described as dark. In the open 
space there is sunlight, and therefore it is illuminated, but in the covering, 
because of the absence of sunlight, it is naturally dark. When Krwa ap­
proached the covering layer of this universe, the four horses which were 
drawing 
His chariot-Saibya, 
Sugriva, 
Meghapu�pa and Balahaka-all 
appeared to hesitate to enter the darkness. This hesitation is also a part of 
The Superexcellent Power of Kr�l)a 
333 
the pastimes of Lord K�l)a because the horses of Kr��a are not ordinary. 
It is not possible for ordinary horses to go all over the universe and then 
enter into its outer covering layers. As Kr��a is transcendental, similarly 
His chariot and His horses and everything about Him are also transcen­
dental, beyond the qualities of this material world. We should always 
remember that Kr��a was playing the part of an ordinary human being, 
and His horses also, by the will of Kr��a, played the parts of ordinary 
horses in hesitating to enter the darkness. 
Kr��a is known as Y ogesvara, as is stated in the last portion of Bhagavad­
gitii. Y ogesvara Hari: all mystic powers are under His control. In our 
experience, we can see many human beings who have yogic mystic power. 
Sometimes they perform very wonderful acts, but Kr��a is understood to 
be the master of all mystic power. Therefore, when He saw that His horses 
were hesitant to proceed into the darkness, He immediately released His 
disc, known as the Sudarsana cakra, which illuminated the sky a thousand 
times brighter than sunlight. The darkness of the covering of the universe 
is also a creation of Kr��a's, and the Sudarsana cakra is Kr�rta's constant 
companion. Thus the darkness was penetrated by His keeping the Sudarsana 
cakra in 
front. Srimad-Bhiigavatam states that the Sudarsana cakra 
penetrated the darkness just as an arrow released from the Sarriga bow 
of Lord Ramacandra penetrated the army of Rava�a. Su means very nice, 
and darsana means observation; by the grace of Lord Kr�rta's disc, 
Sudarsana, everything can be seen very nicely, and nothing can remain in 
darkness. Thus Lord Kr��a and Arjuna crossed over the great region of 
darkness covering the material universes. 
Arjuna then saw the effulgence of light known as the brahmajyoti. The 
brahmajyoti is situated outside the covering of the material universes, and 
because it cannot be seen with our present eyes, this brahmajyoti is 
sometimes called avyakta. This spiritual effulgence is the ultimate destina­
tion of the impersonalists known as Vedantists. The brahmajyoti is also 
described as anantapiiram, unlimited and unfathomed. When Lord Kr��a 
and Arjuna reached this region of the brahmajyoti, Arjuna could not 
tolerate the glaring effulgence, and he closed his eyes. Lord Kr�rta's and 
Arjuna 's reaching the brahmajyoti region is described in Harivarhsa. In that 
portion of the Vedic literature, Kr��a informed Arjuna, "My dear Arjuna, 
the glaring effulgence, the transcendental light which you are seeing, is 
My bodily rays. 0 chief of the descendants of Bharata, this brahmajyoti is 
Myself." As the sun disc and the sunshine cannot be separated, similarly 
Kr��a and His bodily rays, the brahmajyoti, cannot be separated. Thus 
Kr�rta claimed that the brahmajyoti is He Himself. This is clearly stated in 
334 
Kr��a, the Supreme Personality of Godhead 
the Harivarhsa when Kr��a says, "aharh sa(t." The brahmajyoti is a com­
bination of the minute particles known as spiritual sparks, or the living 
entities known as citkana. The Vedic word so'ham, or "I am the brahma­
jyoti," can also be applied to the living entities, who can also claim to 
belong to the brahmajyoti. In the Harivarhsa, Kr��a further explains, "This 
brahmajyoti is an expansion of My spiritual energy." 
Kr�tla told Arjuna, "The brahmajyoti is beyond the region of My ex­
ternal energy, known as miiyii-sakti. When one is situated within this 
material world, it is not possible for him to experience this Brahman 
effulgence. Therefore, in the material world this effulgence is not mani­
fested, whereas in the spiritual world, it is manifested. That is the purport 
of the words vyakta-avyakta. In the Bhagavad-gitii it is said avyakto­
'vyaktiit saniitana(t: both these energies are eternally manifested. 
After this, Lord Kr�tla and Arjuna entered a vast extensive spiritual 
water. This spiritual water is called the Karatilirtiava Ocean or Viraja which 
means that this ocean is the origin of the creation of the material world. 
In the Mrtyufijaya Tantra, a Vedic literature, there .is a vivid description 
of this Karatla Ocean, or Viraja. It is stated there that the highest planetary 
system within the material world is Satyaloka, or Brahmaloka. Beyond 
that there are Rudraloka and Maha-Vi�tiuloka. Regarding this Maha­
Vi�tiuloka, 
it is stated in the Brahma-sarhhitii, ya(t kiirap,iirp.ava-jale 
bhajati sma yoga: "Lord Maha-Vi�tiU is lying in the Karapa Ocean. When 
He exhales, innumerable universes come into existence, and when He 
inhales, innumerable universes enter within Him." In this way, the mate­
rial creation is generated and again withdrawn. When Lord Kr�tla and 
Arjuna entered the water, it appeared that there was a strong hurricane of 
transcendental effulgence brewing, and the water of the Karapa Ocean 
was greatly agitated. By the grace of Lord Kr�pa, Arjuna had the unique 
experience of being able to see the very beautiful Karatla Ocean. 
Accompanied by Kr�tla, Arjuna saw a large palace within the water. 
There were many thousands of pillars and columns made of valuable 
jewels, and the glaring effulgence of those columns was so beautiful that 
Arjuna became charmed by it. Within that palace, Arjuna and Kr�pa saw 
the gigantic form of Anantadeva, who is also known as Se�a. Lord Ananta­
deva or Se�anaga was in the form of a great serpent with thousands of 
hoods, and each one of them was decorated with valuable, effulgent jewels, 
which were beautifully dazzling. Each of Anantadeva's hoods had two 
eyes which appeared to be very fearful. His body was as white as the 
mountaintop of Kailasa, which is always covered by snow. His neck was 
bluish, as were His tongues. Thus Arjuna saw the Se�anaga form, and he 
The Superexcellent Power of Kr�!la 
335 
also saw that on the very soft, white body of Se�anaga, Lord Maha-Vi�rtu 
was lying very comfortably. He appeared to be all-pervading and very 
powerful, and Arjuna could understand that the Supreme Personality of 
Godhead in that form is known as Puro�ottama. He is known as Puru­
�ottama, the best, or the Supreme Personality of Godhead, because from 
this form emanates another form of Vi�rtu, which is known as Garbho­
dakasayi Vi�rtu within the material world. The Maha-Vi�rtu form of the 
Lord, Pum§ottama, is beyond the material world. He is also known as 
Uttama. 
Tama means darkness, and ut means above, transcendental; 
therefore, Uttama means above the darkest region of the material world. 
Arjuna saw that the bodily color of Puru�ottama, Maha-Vi�rtu, was as dark 
as a new cloud in the rainy season; He was dressed in very nice yellow 
clothing. His face was always beautifully smiling, and His eyes, which were 
like lotus petals, were very attractive. Lord Maha-Vi�rtu 's helmet was be­
decked with valuable jewels, and His beautiful earrings enhanced the 
beauty of the curling hair on His head. Lord Maha-Vi�rtu had eight arms, 
all very long, reaching to His knees. His neck was decorated with the 
Kaustubha jewel, and His chest was marked with the symbol of §rivatsa, 
which means the resting place of the goddess of fortune. The Lord wore 
a garland of lotus flowers down to His knees. This long garland is known 
as a vaijayanti garland. 
The Lord was surrounded by His personal associates N anda and Sunanda, 
and the personified Sudarsana disc was also standing by Him. As is stated 
in the Vedas, the Lord has innumerable energies, and they were also 
standing there personified. The most important among them were as 
follows: pu§ti, the energy for nourishment, sri, the energy of beauty, 
kirti, the energy of reputation, and ajii, the energy of material creation. 
All these energies are invested in the administrators of the material world, 
namely Lord Brahma, Lord Siva and Lord Vi�rtu, and in the kings of the 
heavenly planets, lndra, Candra, V arutta and the sun-god. In other words, 
all these demigods, being empowered by the Lord with certain energies, 
engage in the transcendental loving service of the Supreme Personality of 
Godhead. The Maha-Vi�!lu feature is an expansion of Kr�!la's body. It is 
also confirmed in the Brahma-sarhhitii that Maha-Vi�!lu is a portion of a 
plenary expansion of Kr�!la. All such expansions are nondifferent from the 
Personality of Godhead, but since Kr�!la appeared within this material 
world to manifest His pastimes as a human being, He and Arjuna immedi­
ately offered their respects to Lord Maha-Vi�!lu by bowing down before 
Him. It is stated in the Srimad-Bhiigavatam that Lord Kr�!la offered 
respect to Maha-Vi�!lu; this means that He offered obeisances unto Him 
336 
Kr��a, the Supreme Personality of Godhead 
only because Lord Maha-Vi§!lU is nondifferent from He Himself. This 
offering of obeisances by Kr§!la to Maha-Vi§!lU is not, however, the form 
of worship known as ahangraha-upiisanii, which is sometimes recommended 
for persons who are trying to elevate themselves to the spiritual world by 
performing the sacrifice of knowledge. This is also stated in the Bhagavad­
gitii: jfiiina-yajfiena ciipy ante yajanto miim upiisate. 
Although there was no necessity for Kr§!la to offer obeisances, because 
He is the master teacher., He taught Arjuna just how respect should be 
offered to Lord Maha-Vi§!lU. Arjuna, however, became very much afraid 
upon seeing the gigantic form of everything, distinct from the material 
experience. Seeing Kr§!la offering obeisances to Lord Maha-Viwu, he 
immediately followed Him and stood before the Lord with folded hands. 
After this, the gigantic form of Maha-Vi§!lU, greatly pleased, smiled 
pleasingly and spoke as follows. 
"My dear Kr§!la and Arjuna, I was very anxious to see you both, and 
therefore I arranged to take away the babies of the briihmar-a and keep 
them here. I have been expecting to see you both at this palace. You have 
appeared in the material world as My incarnations in ·order to minimize 
the force of the demoniac persons who burden the world. Now after 
killing all these unwanted demons, you will please again come back to Me. 
Both of you are incarnations of the great sage N ara-Naraya!la. Although 
you are both complete in yourselves, to protect the devotees and to 
annihilate the demons and especially to establish religious principles in the 
world so that peace and tranquility may continue, you are teaching the 
basic principles of factual religion so that the people of the world may 
follow you and thereby be peaceful and prosperous." 
Both Lord Kf§!la and Arjuna then offered their obeisances to Lord 
Maha-Vi§�U, and taking back the briihmar-a's children, they returned to 
Dvaraka via the same route by which they had entered the spiritual world. 
All the children of the briihmarta had duly grown up. After returning to 
Dvaraka, Lord Kr§!la and Arjuna delivered to the briihmarw all of his 
sons. 
Arjuna, however, was struck with great wonder after visiting the tran­
scendental world by the grace of Lord Kf§!la. And by the grace of Kf§!la 
he could understand that whatever opulence there may be within this 
material world is an emanation from Him. Any opulent position a 
person may have within this material world is due to Kf§!la's mercy. 
One should therefore ·always be in Kr§!la consciousness, in complete 
gratefulness to Lord Kf§!la, because whatever one may possess is all 
His mercy. 
The Superexcellent Power of Kr�!la 
337 
Arjuna's wonderful experience due to the mercy of Krwa is one of the 
many thousands of pastimes performed by Lord Krwa during His stay in 
this material world. They were all unique and have no parallel in the 
history of the world. All these pastimes prove fully that Kr�!la is the 
Supreme Personality of Godhead, yet while He was present within this 
material world, He· played just like an ordinary man possessing many 
worldly duties. He played the part of an ideal householder, and although 
He possessed 16,000 wives, 16,000 palaces and 160,000 children, He also 
performed many sacrifices, just to teach the royal order how to live in the 
material world for the welfare of humanity. As the ideal Supreme Person­
ality, He fulfilled the desires of everyone, from the briihmaras, the highest 
persons in human society, down �o the ordinary living entities, including 
the lowest of men. Just as King Indra is in charge of distributing rain all 
over the world to satisfy everyone in due course, so Lord Kr�!la satisfies 
everyone by pouring down His causeless mercy. His mission was to give 
protection to the devotees and to kill the demoniac kings; therefore, He 
killed many hundreds and thousands of demons. Some of them He killed 
personally, and some of them were killed by Arjuna, who was deputed by 
Kr�!la. In this way He established many pious kings such as Yudhi�thira at 
the helm of world affairs. Thus, by His divine arrangement He created the 
good government of King Yudhi�thira, and there ensued peace and 
tranquility. 
Thus ends the Bhaktivedanta purport of the Second Volume, Thirty-
fourth Chapter, of Kr�!la, "The Superexcellent Power of Kr§flU."

After returning from the spiritual kingdom, which he was able to visit 
personally along with Kr�!J.a, Arjuna was very much astonished. He thought 
to himself that although he was only an ordinary living entity, by the grace 
of Kr�!la it had been possible for him to see personally the spiritual world. 
Not only had he seen the spiritual world, but he had also personally seen 
the original Maha-Vi�!J.U, the cause of the material creation. It is said that 
Kr�!la never goes out of Vrndavana. Vrndiivanarh parityajya na piidam ekarh 
gacchati. Kr�!la is supreme in Mathura, He is more supreme in Dvaraka, 
and He is most supreme in Vrndavana. Kr�!la's pastimes in Dvaraka are 
displayed by His Vasudeva portion, yet there is no difference between the 
Vasudeva portion manifested in Mathura and Dvaraka and the original 
manifestation of Kr�!la at V rndavana. In the beginning of this book we 
have discussed that when Kr�!la appears, all His incarnations, plenary 
portions and portions of the plenary portions come with Him. Thus some 
of His different pastimes are manifested not by the original Kr�!la Himself 
but by His different portions and plenary portions of incarnation. Arjuna 
was therefore puzzled about how Kr�!la went to see the Kara!J.ar!lavasayi 
Vi�!J.U in the spiritual world. This is fully discussed in the commentaries of 
Srlla Visvanatha Cakravarti Thakur. 
It is understood from the speech of Maha-Vi�!J.U that He was very 
anxious to see Kr�!J.a. It may be said, however, that since Maha-Viwu took 
away the briihmar-a's sons, He certainly must have gone to Dvaraka to do 
so. Therefore, why did He not see Kr�!la there? A possible answer is that 
Kr�!la cannot be seen even by the Maha-Vi�!J.U who is lying in the Causal 
Ocean of the spiritual world, unless Kr�!la gives His permission. Thus 
Maha-Vi�!J.U took away the briihmar-a's sons one after another just after 
their births so that Kr�!la would come personally to retrieve them and then 
Maha-Vi�!J.U would be able to see Him there. If that is so, the next 
338 
Summary Description of Lord I(f��a 's Pastimes 
339 
question is this: Why would Maha-Vi��u come to Dvaraka personally if He 
were not able to see Kr��a? Why did He not send some of His associates to 
take away the sons of the briihmarw? A possible answer is that it is very 
difficult to put any of the citizens of Dvaraka into trouble in the presence 
of Kr��a. Therefore, it was not possible for any of Maha-Vi�!lu's associates 
to take away the briihmar-a's sons, and thus He personally came to take 
them. 
Another question may also be raised: The Lord is known as brahmar-ya­
deva, the worshipable Deity of the briihmar-as, so why was He inclined to 
put a briihmar-a into such a terrible condition of lamentation over one son 
after another until the ninth son was taken away? The answer is that Lord 
Maha-Vi�!lu was so anxious to see Kr��a that He did not hesitate even to 
give trouble to a briihmar-a. Although giving trouble to a briihmar-a is a 
forbidden act, Lord Viwu was prepared to do anything in order to see 
Kr��a-He was so anxious to see Him. After losing each of his sons, the 
briihmar-a would come to the gate of the palace and accuse the King of not 
being able to give the briihmar-as protection and of thus being unfit to sit 
on the royal throne. It was Maha-Vi��u 's plan that the briihmar-a would 
accuse the k§atriyas and Kr�!la, and Kr��a would be obliged to come see 
Him to take back the briihmar-a's sons. 
Still another question may be raised: If Maha-Vi�!lu cannot see Kr��a, 
then how was Kr§!la obliged to come before Him after all to take back the 
sons of the briihmana? The answer is that Lord Krsna went to see Lord 
. 
. 
.
.
 
Maha-Vi�!lu not exactly to take away the sons of the briihmar-a but only 
for Arjuna's sake. His friendship with Arjuna was so intimate that when 
Arjuna prepared himself to die by entering the fire, Kr��a wanted to give 
him complete protection. Arjuna, however, would not desist from entering 
the fire unless the sons of the briihmar-a were brought back. Therefore 
Kr§�a promised him, "I will bring back the briihmar-a's sons. Do not try to 
commit suicide." 
If Lord Kr§!la were going to see Lord Viwu only to reclaim the sons ·of 
the briihmar-a, then He would not have waited until the ninth son was 
taken. But when the ninth son was taken away by Lord Maha-Vi�!lu and 
Arjuna was therefore ready to enter the fire because his promise was going 
to prove false, that serious situation made Lord Krwa decide to go with 
Arjuna to see Maha-Vi�!lu. It is said that Arjuna is an empowered incar­
nation of Nara-Naraya!la. He is even sometimes called Nara-Naraya!la. The 
Nara-Naraya!la incarnation is also one of Lord Vi§!lU's plenary expansions. 
Therefore, when Kr�!la and Arjuna went· to see Lord Vi§!l.U, it is to be 
understood that Arjuna visited in His Nara-Naraya!la capacity, just as 
340 
Kr��a, the Supreme Personality of Godhead 
Kr§!la, when He displayed His pastimes in Dvaraka, acted in His Vasudeva 
capacity. 
After visiting the spiritual world, Arjuna concluded that whatever opu­
lence anyone can show within the material or spiritual worlds is all a gift 
of Lord Krsna. Lord Krsna is manifested in various forms, as Visnu-tattva 
. 
. 
. 
. 
. . 
. 
. 
and jiva-tattva, or, in other words, as siirhsa and vibhinniirhsa. Vi§rz.u-tattva 
is known as siirhsa, and jiva-tattva is known as vibhinniirhsa. He can, 
therefore, display Himself by His different transcendental pastimes, either 
in the portion of siirhsa or vibhinniirhsa, as He likes, but still He remains 
the original Supreme Personality of Godhead . 
The concluding portion of Kr§!la's pastimes is found in the Nintieth 
Chapter of the Tenth Canto of Srimad-Bhiigavatam, and in this chapter 
Sukadeva Gosvami wanted to explain how Krwa lived happily at Dvaraka 
with all opulences. Krwa's opulence of strength has already been displayed 
in His different pastimes, and now it will be shown how His residence at 
Dvaraka displayed His opulences of wealth and beauty. In this material 
world, which is only a perverted reflection of the. spiritual wprld, the 
opulences of wealth and beauty are considered to be the highest of all 
opulences. Therefore, while Kr§!la stayed on this planet as the Supreme 
Personality of Godhead, His opulences of wealth and beauty had no com­
parison within the three worlds. Kr§!la enjoyed sixteen thousand beautiful 
wives, and it is most significant that He lived at Dvaraka as the only hus­
band of these hundreds and thousands of beautiful women. It is specifically 
stated in this connection that He was the only husband of sixteen thousand 
wives. It is, of course, not unheard of in the history of the world that a 
powerful king would keep many hundreds of queens, but although such a 
king might be the only husband of so many wives, he could not enjoy all 
of them at one time. Kr§!la, however, enjoyed all of His sixteen thousand 
wives simultaneously. 
Although it may be said that yogis also can expand their bodies into 
many forms, the yogis' expansion and Lord Kr§!la's expansion are not one 
and the same. Kr§!la is therefore sometimes called yogesvara, the master of 
all yogis. In the Vedic literature we find that the yogi Saubhari Muni ex­
panded himself into eight. But that expansion was like a television expan­
sion. The television image is manifested in millions of expansions, but 
those expansions cannot act differently; they are simply reflections of the 
original and can only act exactly as the original does. Kr§!la's expansion is 
not material like the expansion of the television or the yogi. When Narada 
visited the different palaces of Krwa, he saw that Kr§!la, in His different 
expansions, was variously engaged in each and every palace of the queens. 
Summary Description of Lord Kr��a's Pastimes
341 
It is also said that Kr�!ia lived at Dvaraka as the husband of the goddess 
of fortune. Queen Rukmi!li is the goddess of fortune, and all the other 
queens are her expansions. So Kr�!la, the chief of the Vr��i dynasty, 
enjoyed with the goddess of fortune in full opulence. The queens of Kr�p.a 
are described as permanently youthful and beautiful. Although Kr�!la had 
grandchildren and great-grandchildren, neither Kr�p.a nor His queens looked 
older than sixteen or twenty years of age. The young queens were so 
beautiful that when they moved they appeared like lightning moving in 
the sky. They were always dressed with exalted ornaments and garments 
and were always engaged in sportive activities like dancing, singing or 
playing ball on the roofs of the palaces. The dancing and tennis playing 
of girls in the material world appear to be perverted reflections of the 
original pastimes of the original Personality of Godhead, Kr�!la, and His 
Wives. 
The roads and streets of the city of Dvaraka were always crowded with 
elephants, horses, chariots and infantry soldiers. When elephants are en­
gaged in service, they are given liquor to drink, and it is said that the 
elephants in Dvaraka were given so much liquor that they would sprinkle 
a great quantity of it on the road and still would walk on the streets 
intoxicated. The infantry soldiers passing on the streets were profusely 
decorated with golden ornaments, and horses and golden chariots plied 
along the streets. In all directions of Dvaraka City, wherever one would 
turn his eyes he would find green parks and gardens, and each of them was 
filled with trees and plants laden with fruits and flowers. Because there 
were so many nice trees of fruits and flowers, all the sweetly chirping 
birds and the buzzing bumblebees joined together to make sweet vibra­
tions. The city of Dvaraka thus fully displayed all opulences. The heroes 
in the dynasty of Y adu used to think themselves the most fortunate 
residents of the city, and actually they enjoyed all transcendental facilities. 
All the sixteen thousand palaces of Kr�p.a's queens were situated in this 
beautiful city of Dvaraka, and Lord Kr�!la, the supreme eternal enjoyer of 
all these facilities, expanded Himself into sixteen thousand forms and 
simultaneously en,gaged in different family affairs in those sixteen thousand 
palaces. In each and every one of the palaces there were nicely decorated 
gardens and lakes. The crystal clear water of the lakes contained many 
blooming lotus flowers. of different colors like blue, yellow, white and red, 
and the saffron powder from the lotus flowers was blown all around by 
the breeze. All the lakes were full of beautiful swans, ducks and cranes, 
crying occasionally with melodious sounds. Lord Sri Kr�!la sometimes 
entered those lakes, or sometimes the rivers, with His wives and enjoyed 
�
342 
Kr��a, the Supreme Personality of Godhead 
swimming pastimes with them in full jubilation. Sometimes the wives of 
Lord Kr��a, who were all goddesses of fortune, would embrace the Lord 
in the midst of the water while swimming or taking bath, and the red 
vermilion of kunkuma decorating the beauty of their breasts would adorn 
the chest of the Lord with a reddish color. 
The impersonalists would not dare to believe that in the spiritual world 
there are such varieties of enjoyment, but in order to demonstrate the 
factual, 
ever-blissful 
enjoyment in the spiritual world, 
Lord Kr�!la 
descended on this planet and showed that the spiritual world is not devoid 
of such pleasurable facilities of life. The only difference is that in the 
spiritual world such facilities are eternal, never-ending occurrences, whereas 
in the material world they are simply impermanent perverted reflections. 
When Lord Kr�!la was engaged in such enjoyment, the Gandharvas and 
professional musicians would glorify Him with melodious musical concerts, 
accompanied by mrdangas, drums, kettledrums, stringed instruments and 
brass bugles, and the whole atmosphere would change into a greatly festive 
celebration. In a festive mood, the wives of the Lord would sometimes 
sprinkle water on the Lord's body with a syringe-like Instrument, and the 
Lord would similarly wet the bodies of the queens. When Kr�!la and the 
queens engaged themselves in these pastimes, it seemed as if the heavenly 
King, Y ak�araja, were engaged in such pastimes with his many wives. 
(Y ak�araja is also known as Kuvera and is considered to be the treasurer of 
the heavenly kingdom.) When the wives of Lord Kr�!la thus became wet, 
their breasts and thighs would increase in beauty a thousand times, and 
their long hair would fall down to decorate those parts of their bodies. 
The beautiful flowers which were placed in their hair would fall, and the 
queens, being seemingly harassed by the Lord's throwing water at them, 
would approach Him on the plea of snatching the syringe-like instru­
ment, and this attempt would create a situation wherein the Lord 
could embrace them as they willingly approached Him. Upon being 
embraced, the wives of the Lord would feel on their mouths a clear 
indication of conjugal love, and this WQuld create an atmosphere of 
spiritual bliss. When the garland on the neck of the Lord then touched 
the breasts of the queens, their whole bodies became covered with 
saffron yellow. Being engaged in their celestial pastimes, the queens 
forgot themselves, and their loosened hair appeared like the beautiful 
waves of a river. When the queens sprinkled water on the body of Kr�l)a 
or He sprinkled water on the bodies of the queens, the whole situation 
appeared just like an elephant enjoying in a lake along with many she­
elephants. 
Summary Description of Lord Kr��a's Pastimes

After enjoying fully amongst themselves, the queens and Lord Kr�pa 
would come out of the water, and their wet garments, which were very 
valuable, would be given up by them to be taken away by the professional 
singers and dancers. These singers and dancers had no other means of 
subsistence than the rewards of valuable garments and ornaments left by 
the queens and kings on such occasions. The whole system of society was 
so well planned that all the members of society in their different positions 
as briihmar-as, k§atriyas, vaisyas, and siidras had no difficulty in earning 
their livelihood. There was no competition among the divisions of society. 
The original conception of the caste system was so planned that one group 
of men engaged in a particular type of occupation would not compete with 
another group of men engaged in a different occupation. 
In this way, Lord Kr�v.a used to enjoy the company of His sixteen 
thousand wives. Devotees of the Lord who want to love the Supreme 
Personality of Godhead in the mellow of conjugal love are elevated to the 
position of becoming wives of Kr�v.a, and Kr�v.a also keeps them always 
attached to Him by His kind behavior. Kr�v.a's behavior with His wives, His 
movements, His talking with them, His smiling, His embracing, and similar 
other activities just like a loving husband kept them always very much 
attached to Him. That is the highest perfection of life. If someone remains 
always attached to Kr�v.a, it is to be understood that he is liberated, and 
his life is successful. With any devotee who loves Krwa with his heart and 
soul, Kr�pa reciproca�es in such a way that the devotee cannot remain 
unattached to Him. The reciprocal dealings of Kr�v.a and His devotees are 
so attractive that a devotee cannot think of any subject matter other than 
Krsna. 
For all the queens, Kr�v.a only was their worshipable objective. They 
were always absorbed in thought of Krwa, the lotus-eyed and beautifully 
blackish Personality of Godhead. Sometimes, in thought of Krwa, they 
remained silent, and in great ecstasy of bhiiva and anubhiiva they sometimes 
spoke as if in delirium. Sometimes, even in the presence of Lord Kr�v.a, 
they vividly described the pastimes they had enjoyed in the lake or in the 
river with Him. Some of such talk may be described here. 
One of the queens said to the bird kurari, "My dear kurari, now it is 
very late at night. Everyone is sleeping. The whole world is now calm and 
peaceful. At this time, the Supreme Personality of Godhead is sleeping, 
although His knowledge is undisturbed by any circumstance. Then why 
are you not sleeping? Why are you lamenting like this throughout the 
whole night? My dear friend, is it that you are also attracted by the lotus 
eyes of the Supreme Personality of Godhead and by His sweet smiling and 
344 
Kr��a, the Supreme Personality of Godhead 
attractive words, exactly as I am? Do those dealings of the Supreme 
Personality of Godhead pinch your heart as they do mine? 
"Hello cakraviiki. Why have you closed your eyes? Are you searching 
after your husband, who might have gone to foreign countries? Why are 
you lamenting so pitiably? Alas, it appears that you are very much 
aggrieved. Or is it a fact that you also are willing to become an eternal 
servitor of the Supreme Personality of Godhead? I think that you are 
anxious to put a garland on the lotus feet of the Lord and then place it on 
your hair. 
"0 my dear ocean, why are you roaring all day and night? Don't you 
like to sleep? I think that you have been attacked by insomnia, or, if I am 
not wrong, my dear Syamasundara has tactfully taken away your gravity 
and power of forbearence, which are your natural qualifications. Is it a 
fact that for this reason you are suffering from insomnia like me? Yes, I 
admit that there is no remedy for this disease. 
"My dear moon-god, I think that you have been attacked by a severe 
type of tuberculosis. For this reason, you are becoming thinner and thinner 
day by day. 0 my lord, you are now so weak that your thin rays cannot 
dissipate the darkness of night. Or is it a fact that, just as I have, you also 
have been stunned by the mysteriously sweet words of my Lord Syama­
sundara. Is it a fact that it is because of this severe anxiety that you are 
so grave? 
"0 breeze from the Himalayas, what have I done to you that you are so 
intent on teasing me by awakening my lust to meet Kf§p.a? Do you not 
know that I have already been injured by the crooked policy of the 
Personality of Godhead? My dear Himalayan breeze, please know that I 
have already been stricken. There is no need to injure me more and more. 
"My dear beautiful cloud, the color of your beautiful body exactly 
resembles my dearmost Syamasundara's bodily hue. I think, therefore, that 
you are very much dear to my Lord, the chief of the dynasty of the Y adus, 
and because you are so dear to Him, you are, exactly as I am, absorbed in 
meditation. I can appreciate that your heart is full of anxiety for Syama­
sundara. You appear to be excessively eager to see Him, and I see that for 
this reason only, there are drops of tears gliding down from your eyes, 
just as there are from mine. My dear black cloud, we must admit frankly 
that to establish an intimate relationship with Syamasundara means to 
purchase unnecessary anxieties while we are otherwise comfortable at 
home." 
Generally the cuckoo sounds its cooing vibration at the end of night or 
early in the morning. When the queens heard the cooing of the cuckoo at 
Summary Description of Lord· Kr�!la's Pastimes 
345 
the end of night, they said, "Dear cuckoo, your voice is very sweet. As 
soon as you vibrate your sweet voice, we immediately remember Syama­
sundara because your voice exactly resembles His. We must frankly admit 
that your voice is imbued with nectar, and it is so invigorating that it is 
competent to bring back life to those who are almost dead in separation 
from their dearmost friend. So we are very much obliged to you. Please 
let us know how we can welcome you or how we can do something 
for you." 
The queens continued talking like that, and they addressed the mountain 
as follows: "Dear mountain, you are very generous. By your gravitation 
only, the whole crust of this earth is properly maintained, and because 
you are discharging your duties very faithfully, you do not know how to 
move. Because you are so grave, you do not move hither and thither, nor 
do you say anything. Rather, you alway& .appear to be in a thoughtful 
mood. It may be that you are always thinking of a very grave and 
important subject matter, but we can guess very clearly what you are 
thinking of. We are sure that you are thinking of placing the lotus feet of 
Syamasundara on your raised peaks, as we want to place His lotus feet on 
our raised breasts. 
"Dear dry rivers, we know that because this is the summer season, all 
your beds are dry and you have no water. Because �l your water has now 
been dried up, you are no longer beautified by blooming lotus flowers. At 
the present moment, you appear to be very lean and thin, so we can 
understand that your position is exactly like ours. We have lost everything 
due to being separated from Syamasundara, and we no longer hear His 
pleasing words. Our hearts no longer work properly, and therefore we also 
have become very lean and thin. We think, therefore, that you are just like 
us. You have turned lean and thin because you are not getting any water 
from your husband, the ocean, through the clouds." The example given 
herewith by the queens is very appropriate. The river beds become dry 
when the ocean no longer supplies water through the clouds. The ocean is 
supposed to be the husband of the river and therefore is supposed to 
support her. Unless a woman is supported by the husband with the 
necessities of life, she also becomes as dry as a dry river. 
One queen addressed a swan as follows. "My dear swan, please come 
here, come here. You are welcome. Please sit down and take some milk. 
My dear swan, can you tell me if you have any message from Syamasundara? 
I take you to be a messenger from Him. If you have any such news, please 
tell me. Our Syamasundara is always very independent. He never comes 
under the control of anyone. We have all failed to control Him, and 
346 
Kr��a, the Supreme Personality of Godhead 
therefore we ask you, is He keeping Himself well? I may inform you that 
Syamasundara is very fickle. His friendship is always temporary; it breaks 
even by slight agitation. But would you kindly explain why He is so unkind 
to me? Formerly He said that I alone am His dearmost wife. Does He 
remember this assurance? Anyway, you are welcome. Please sit down. But 
I cannot accept your entreaty to go to Syamasundara. When He does not 
care for me, why should I be mad after Him? I am very sorry to let you 
know that you have become the messenger of a poor-hearted soul. You 
are asking me to go to Him, but I am not going. What is that? You talk of 
His coming to me? Does He desire to come here to fulfill my long expecta­
tion for Him? All right. You can bring Him here. But don't bring with Him 
His most beloved goddess of fortune. Do you think that He cannot be 
separated from the goddess of fortune even for a moment? Could He not 
come here alone, without Lak�mi? His behavior is very displeasing. Does 
it mean that without Lak�mi, Syamasundara cannot be happy? Can't He 
be happy with any other wife? Does it mean that the goddess of fortune 
has the ocean of love for Him, and none of us can compare to her?" 
All the wives of Lord Kr�!la were completely absorbed in thought of 
Him. Kr�!la is known as the yogesvara, the master of all yogis, and all the 
wives of K.f�p.a at Dvaraka used to keep this yogesvara within their hearts. 
Instead of trying to be master of all yogic mystic powers, it is better if one 
simply keeps the supreme yogesvara, Kr�!J.a, within his heart. Thus one's 
life can become perfect, and one can very easily be transferred to the 
kingdom of God. It is to be understood that all the queens of Kr�p.a who 
lived with Him at Dvaraka were in their previous lives very greatly exalted 
devotees who wanted to establish a relationship with Kr�!la in conjugal 
love. Thus they were given the chance to become His wives and enjoy a 
constant loving relationship with Him. Ultimately, they were alltransferred 
to the Vaikup.tha planets. 
The Supreme Absolute Truth Personality of Godhead is never imper­
sonal. All the Vedic literatures glorify the transcendental performance of 
His various personal activities and pastimes. It is said that in the Vedas and 
in the Riimiiya"[ta, only the activities of the Lord are described. Every­
where in the Vedic literature, His glories are sung. As soon as soft-hearted 
people such as women hear those transcendental pastimes of Lord Kr�p.a, 
they immediately become attracted to Him. Soft-hearted women and girls 
are therefore very easily drawn to the Kr�p.a consciousness movement. 
One who is thus drawn to the Kr�p.a consciousness movement and tries to 
keep himself in constant touch with such consciousness certainly gets the 
supreme salvation, going back to Kr�p.a at Goloka Vrndavana. If simply by 
Summary Description of Lord Kr��a's Pastimes 
347 
developing Kr�v.a consciousness one can be transferred to the spiritual 
world, one can simply imagine how blissful and blessed were the queens 
of Lord Kr�v.a, who talked with Him personally and who saw Lord Kr�v.a 
eye to eye. No one can properly describe the fortune of the wives of Lord 
Kr�v.a. They took care of Him personally by rendering various transcenden­
tal services like bathing Him, feeding Him, pleasing Him and serving Him. 
Thus no one's austerities can compare to the service of the queens at 
Dvaraka. 
Sukadeva Gosvami informed Maharaja Parik�it that for self-realization 
the austerities and penances performed by the queens' at Dvaraka have no 
comparison. The objective of self-realization is one: Krwa. Therefore, 
although the dealings of the queens with Kr�v.a appear just like ordinary 
dealings between husband and wife, the principal point to be observed is the 
queens' attachment for Kr�v.a. The entire process of austerity and penance 
is meant to detach one from the material world and to enhance one's 
attachment to Kr�v.a, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Kr�p.a is the 
shelter of all persons advancing in self-realization. As an ideal householder, 
He lived with His wives and performed the Vedic rituals just to show less 
intelligent persons that the Supreme Lord is never impersonal. Kr�pa lived 
with wife and children in all opulence, exactly like an ordinary conditioned 
soul, just to exemplify to those souls who are actually conditioned that 
one may enter into the circle of family life as long as Kr�v.a is the center. 
For example, the. members of the Y adu dynasty lived in the family of 
Kr�pa, and Kr�v.a was the center of all their activities. 
Renunciation is not as important as enhancing one's attachment to 
Kr�v.a. The Kr�v.a consciousness movement is especially meant for this 
purpose. We are preaching on the principle that it does not matter whether 
a man is a sannyiisi or grhastha. One simply has to increase his attachment 
f<;>r Kr�v.a, and then his life is successful. Following in the footsteps of Lord 
Sri Krwa, one can live with his family members or within the society or 
nation, not for the purpose of indulging in sense gratification but to 
realize Kr�v.a by advancing in attachment for Him. There are four princi­
ples of elevation from conditional life to the life of liberation, which are 
technically known as dharma, artha, kiima and mok�a (religion, economic 
development, sense gratification and liberation). If one lives a family life 
following in the footsteps of Lord Kr�v.a's family members, one can 
achieve all four of these principles of success simultaneously by making 
Kr�v.a the center of all activities. 
It is already known to us that Kr�v.a had 16,108 wives. All these wives 
were exalted liberated souls, and among them Queen Rukmiv.i was the 
348 
Kr��a, the Supreme Personality of Godhead 
chief. After Rukmi�i there were seven other principal wives, and the names 
of the sons of these eight principal queens have already been mentioned. 
Besides these eight queens, Lord Kr��a had ten sons by each of the other 
queens. Thus all together Kr��a's children numbered 16,108 times ten. 
One should not be astonished to hear that Kr�pa had so many sons. One 
should always remember that Kr��a is the Supreme Personality of Godhead 
and that He has unlimited potencies. He claims all living entities as His 
sons, so even if He had sixteen million sons attached to Him personally, 
there would be no cause for astonishment. 
Among Kr��a's greatly powerful sons, eighteen sons were mahii-rathas.
The mahii-rathas could fight alone against many thousands of soldiers, 
charioteers, cavalry and elephants. The reputations of these eighteen sons 
are very widespread and are described in almost all the Vedic literatures. 
The eighteen mahii-ratha sons are listed as Pradyumna, Aniruddha, Dipti­
man, Bhanu, Samba, Madhu, Brhadbhanu, Citrabhanu, V rka, Aruna, 
Pu�kara, Vedabahu, Srutadeva, S�nandana, Citrabahu, Vin1pa, Kavi a·nd 
Nyagrodha. Of these eighteen mahii-ratha sons of Kr��a, Pradyumna is 
considered to be the foremost. Pradyumna happened to be the eldest son 
of Queen Rukmi�i, and he inherited all the qualities of his great father, 
Lord Kf�pa. He married the daughter of his maternal uncle, Rukmi, and 
Aniruddha, the son of Pradyumna, was born from that marriage. Ani­
ruddha was so powerful that he could fight against ten thousand elephants. 
He married the granddaughter of Rukmi, the brother of his grandmother, 
Rukmipi. Because the relationship between these cousins was distant, such 
a marriage was not uncommon. Aniruddha's son was Vajra. When the 
whole Y adu dynasty was destroyed by the curse of a briihmara, only 
V ajra survived. V ajra had one son whose name was Pratibahu. The son of 
Pratibahu was named Subahu, the son of Subahu was named Santasena, 
and the son of Santasena was Satasena. 
It is stated by Sukadeva Gosvami that all the members of the Y adu 
dynasty had many children. Just as Kr�pa had many sons, grandsons and 
great-grandsons, so each one of the kings named herewith also had similar 
family extensions. Not only did all of them have many children, but all 
were extraordinarily rich and opulent. None of them were weak or short­
lived, and above all, all the members of the Y adu dynasty were staunch 
devotees of the brahminical culture. It is the duty of the k�atriya kings to 
maintain the brahminical culture and to protect the qualified briihmaras,
and all these kings discharged their duties very rightly. The members of 
the Y adu dynasty were so numerous that it would be very difficult to 
describe them all even if one had a duration of life of many thousands of 
Summary Description of Lord Kr�!ia's Pastimes 
349 
years. Srila Sukadeva Gosvami informed Maharaja Parik�it that he had 
heard from reliable sources that simply to teach the children of the Y adu 
dynasty, there were as many as 38,800,000 tutors or iiciiryas. If so many 
teachers were needed to educate their children, one can simply imagine 
how vast was the number of family members. As for their military strength, 
it is said that King Ugrasena alone had ten quadrillion soldiers as personal 
bodyguards. 
Before the advent of Lord Kr�pa within this universe, there were many 
battles between the demons and the demigods. Many demons died in the 
fighting, and they all were given the chance to take birth in high royal 
families on this earth. Because of their royal exalted posts, all these 
demons became very much puffed up, and their only business was to 
harass their subjects. Lord Kr�pa appeared on this planet just at the end of 
Dvapara-yuga in order to annihilate all these demonic kings. As it is said in 
the Bhagavad-gitii, paritriirtiiya siidhuniirh viniisiiya ca du�krtam: The Lord 
comes to protect the devotees and to annihilate the miscreants. Some of 
the demigods were also asked to appear on this earth to assist in the 
transcendental pastimes of Lord Kr�pa. When Kr�pa appeared, He carrie in 
the association of His eternal servitors,· but the demigods also were re­
quested to come down to assist Him, and thus all of them took their births 
in the Yadu dynasty. The Yadu dynasty had 101 Clans in different parts 
of the country. All the members of these different clans respected Lord 
Krwa in a manner befitting His divine position, and all of them were His 
devotees heart and soul. Thus all the members of the Y adu dynasty were 
very opulent, happy and prosperous, and they had no anxieties. Because 
of their implicit faith in and devotion to Lord Kr�pa, they were never 
defeated by any other kings. Their love of Krsna was so intense that in 
their regular activities-in sitting, sleeping, traveling, talking, sporting, 
cleansing and bathing-they were simply absorbed in thoughts of Kr�pa 
and paid no attention to bodily necessities. That is the symptom of a pure 
devotee of Lord Kr�P"a. Just as when a man is fully absorbed in some 
particular thought, he sometimes forgets his other bodily activities, so the 
members of the Y adu dynasty acted automatically for their bodily 
necessities, but their actual attention was always fixed on Kr�pa. Their 
bodily activities were performed mechanically, but their minds were 
always absorbed in Kr�pa consciousness. 
Snia Sukadeva Gosvami has concluded the Ninetieth Chapter of the 
Tenth Canto of Srimad-Bhiigavatam by pointing out five particular 
excellences of Lord Krsna. The first excellence is that before Lord Krsna's 
appearance in the Y ad�. family, the River Ganges was known as the p��est 
350 
Kr��a, the Supreme Personality of Godhead 
of all things; even impure things could be purified simply by touching the 
water of the Ganges. This superexcellent power of the Ganges water was 
due to its having emanated from the toe of Lord Vi��u. But when Lord 
Kr��a, the Supreme Vi��u, appeared in the family of the Yadu dynasty, 
He traveled personally throughout the kingdom of the Y adus, and by His 
intimate association with the. Y adu dynasty, the whole family not only 
became very famous but also became more effective in purifying others 
than the water of the Ganges. 
The next excellence of Lord Kr�pa 's appearance was that although 
apparently He gave protection to the devotees and annihilated the demons, 
both the devotees and the demons achieved the same result. Lord Kr�pa is 
the bestower of five kinds of liberation, of which sayujya-mukti, or the 
liberation of becoming one with the Supreme, was given to the demons like 
Kamsa, whereas the gopis were given the chance to associate with Him 
personally. The gopis kept their individuality to enjoy the company of 
Lord Kr��a, but Kamsa was accepted into His impersonal brahmajyoti. 
In other words, both the demons and the gopis were &piritually liberated, 
but because the demons were enemies and the gopis were friends, the 
demons were killed and the go pis were protected. 
The third excellence of Lord Kr�pa 's appearance was that the goddess of 
fortune, who is worshiped by demigod� like Lord Brahma, lndra and 
Candra, remained always engaged in the service of the Lord, even though 
the Lord gave more preference to the gopis. Lak�miji, the goddess of 
fortune, tried her best to be on an equal level with the gopis, but she was 
not successful. Nevertheless, she remained faithful to Kr��a, although 
generally she does not remain at one place even if worshiped by demigods 
like Lord Brahma. 
The fourth excellence of Lord Kr��a's appearance concerns the glories 
of His name. It is stated in the Vedic literature that by chanting the 
different names of Lord Vi��u a thousand times, one may be bestowed 
with the same benefits as by thrice chanting the holy name of Lord Rama. 
And by chanting the holy name of Lord Kr��a only once, one receives the 
same benefit. In other words, of all the holy names of the Supreme Per­
sonality of Godhead, including Vi��u and Rama, the holy name of Kr��a 
is the most powerful. The Vedic literature therefore specifically stresses 
the chanting of the holy name of Krwa: Hare Kr��a, Hare Kr�pa, Kr�pa 
Kr�!J.a, Hare Hare/ Hare Rama, Hare Rama, Rama Rama, Hare Hare. Lord 
Caitanya introduced this chanting of the holy name of Kr�!la in this age, 
thus making liberation more easily obtainable than in other ages. In 
other words, Lord Kr�!la is more excellent than His other incarnations, 
Summary Description of Lord Kr��a's Pastimes 
351 
although all of them are equally the Supreme Personality of Godhead. 
The fifth excellence of Lord Kr�na's appearance is that He established 
the most excellent of all religious principles by His one statement in the 
Bhagavad-gitii that simply by surrendering unto Him, one can discharge all 
the principles of religious rites. In the Vedic literature there are twenty 
kinds of religious principles mentioned, and each of them is described in 
different siistras. But Lord K.f�:pa is so kind to the fallen conditioned souls 
of this age that He personally appeared and asked everyone to give up all 
kinds of religious rites and simply surrender unto Him. It is said that this 
age of Kali is three-fourths devoid of religious principles. Hardly one fourth 
of the principles of religion are still observed in this age. But by the mercy 
of Lord Kr�:pa, this vacancy of Kali-yuga has not only been completely 
filled, but the religious process has been made so easy that simply by 
rendering transcendental loving service unto Lord Krwa by chanting His 
holy names, Hare Kr�:pa, Hare K.f�:pa, K.f�:pa Kr�:pa, Hare Hare/ Hare Rama, 
Hare Rama, Rama Rama, Hare Hare, one can achieve the highest result of 
religion, namely, being transferred to the highest planet within the spiritual 
world, Goloka Vrndavana. One can thus immediately estimate the benefit 
of Lord Kr�:pa's appearance and can understand that His giving relief to 
the people of the world by His appearance was not at all extraordinary. 
Srila Sukadeva Gosvami thus concludes his description of the super­
exalted position of Lord Kr��a by glorifying Him in the following way: 
"0 Lord Kr�:pa, all glories unto You. You are present in everyone's heart 
as Paramatma. Therefore You are known as J ananivasa, one who lives in 
everyone's heart." As confirmed in the Bhagavad-gitii, i5vara� saroa­
bhiltiiniim hrd-dese 'rjuna ti�thati: The Supreme Lord in His Paramatma 
feature lives within everyone's heart. This does not mean, however, that 
Kr�:pa has no separate existence as the Supreme Personality of Godhead. 
The 
Mayavadi philosophers accept the all-pervading feature of Para­
brahman, but when Parabrahman, or the Supreme Lord, appears, they 
think that He appears under the control of material nature. Because Lord 
Kr�:pa appeared as the son of Devaki, the Mayavadi philosophers accept 
Kr�:pa to be an ordinary living entity who takes birth within this material 
world. Therefore Sukadeva Gosvami warns them that devaki-janma-viida, 
which means that although Kr�:pa is famous as the son of Devaki, actually 
He is the Supersoul or the all-pervading Supreme Personality of Godhead. 
The devotees, however, take this word devaki-janma-viida in a different 
way. The devotees understand that actually Kr�pa was the son of mother 
Y asoda. Although Kr�:pa first of all appeared as the son of Devaki, He 
immediately transferred Himself to the lap of mother Y asoda, and His 
352 
Kr��a, the Supreme Personality of Godhead 
childhood pastimes were blissfully enjoyed by mother Yasoda and Nanda 
Maharaja. This fact was also admitted by Vasudeva himself when he met 
Nanda Maharaja and Y asoda at Kuruk�etra. He admitted that Kr�p.a and 
Balarama were actually the sons of mother Y asoda and N anda Maharaja. 
Vasudeva and Devaki were only Their official father and mother. Their 
actual father and mother were Nanda and Y asoda. Therefore Sukadeva 
Gosvami addressed Lord Kr��a as devaki-janma-viida. 
Sukadeva Gosvami then glorifies the Lord as one who is honored by the 
yadu-vara-pari§at, the assembly house of the Yadu dynasty, and as the killer 
of different kinds of demons. Kr�p.a, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, 
co�ld have killed all the demons by employing His different material 
energies, but He wanted to kill them personally in order to give them 
salvation. There was no need of Kr�p.a's coming to this material world to 
kill the demons. Simply by His willing, many hundreds and thousands of 
demons could have been killed without His personal endeavor. But actually 
He descended for His pure devotees, to play as a child with mother Y asoda 
and Nanda Maharaja and to give pleasure to the inhabitants of Dvaraka. By 
killing the demons and by giving protection to the devotees, Lord Kr�p.a 
established the real religious principle, which is simply love of God. By 
following the factual religious principles of love of God, even the living 
entities known as sthira-cara were also delivered of all material contami­
nation and were transferred to the spiritual kingdom. Sthira means the 
trees and plants, which cannot move, and cara means the moving animals, 
specifically the cows. When Kr�p.a was present, He delivered all the trees, 
monkeys and other plants and animals who happened to see Him and 
serve Him both in V rndavana and in Dvaraka. 
Lord Kr�p.a is especially glorified for His giving pleasure to the go pis and 
the queens .of Dvaraka. Sukadeva Gosvami glorifies Lord Kr��a for His 
enchanting smile, by which He enchanted not only the go pis at V rndavana 
but also the queens at Dvaraka. The exact word used in this connection is 
vardhayan kiimadevam. In Vrndavana as the boy friend of many gopis and 
in Dvaraka as the husband of many queens, Kr�p.a increased their lusty 
desires to enjoy with Him. For God realization or self-realization, one 
generally has to undergo severe austerities and penances for many, many 
thousands of years, and then it may be possible to realize God. But the 
gopis and the queens of Dvaraka, simply by enhancing their lusty desires 
to enjoy Kr�p.a as their boy friend or husband, received the highest type of 
salvation. 
This behavior of Lord Kr�p.a with the gopis and queens is unique 
in the history of self-realization. Usually people understand that for 
Summary Description of Lord Kr�!ia's Pastimes 
353 
self-realization one has to go to the forest or to the mountains and undergo 
severe austerities and penances. But the gopis and the queens, simply by 
being attached to Kr�!la in conjugal love and enjoying His company in a 
so-called sensuous life full of luxury and opulence, achieved the highest 
salvation, which is im-possible to be achieved even by great sages and 
saintly persons. Similarly, the demons such as Kamsa, Dantavakra, Sisupala, 
etc., also got the highest benefit of being transferred to the spiritual world. 
In the beginning of Srimad-Bhiigavatam, Srila Vyasadeva offered his 
respectful obeisances to the Supreme Truth, Vasudeva, Kr�pa. After that 
he taught his son, Sukadeva Gosvami, to preach Srimad-Bhiigavatam. It is 
in this connection that Sukadeva Gosvami glorifies the Lord as jayati. 
Following in the footsteps of Srila Vyasadeva, Sukadeva Gosvami and all 
the iiciiryas in disciplic succession, the whole population of the world 
should glorify Lord Kr�!J.a, and for their best interest they should take to 
this Kr�!la consciousness movement. The process is easy and helpful. It is 
simply to chant the mahiimantra, Hare Kr�pa, Hare Kr�pa, Kr�pa Kr�pa, 
Hare Hare/Hare Rama, Hare Rama, Rama Rama, Hare Hare. Lord Caitanya­
has therefore recommended that one should be callous to the material up-s 
and downs. Material life is temporary, and so the ups and downs of life may 
come and go. When they come, one should be as tolerant as a tree and as 
humble and meek as the straw in the street, but certainly he must engage 
himself in Kr�pa consciousness by chanting Hare Kr�pa, Hare Kr�pa, Kr�pa 
Krwa, Hare Hare. 
The Supreme Personality of Godhead, Kr�pa, the Supersoul of all living 
entities, out of His _causeless mercy comes down and manifests His different 
transcendental pastimes in different incarnations. Hearing the attractive 
pastimes of Lord Kr�pa's different incarnations is a chance for liberation 
for the conditioned soul, and the most fascinating and pleasing activities 
of Lord Kr�pa Himself are still more attractive because Lord Kr�pa per­
sonally is all-attractive. 
Following in the holy footsteps of Srila Sukadeva Gosvami, we have 
tried to present this book K[§!ta for being read and heard by the condi­
tioned souls of this age. By hearing the pastimes of Lord Kr�pa, one is sure 
and certain to get salvation and be transferred back home, back to 
Godhead. It is recommended by Sukadeva Gosvami that as we hear the 
transcendental pastimes and activities of the Lord, we gradually cut 
the knots of material contamination. Therefore, regardless of what one 
is, if one wants the association of Lord Krwa in the transcendental 
kingdom of God for eternity in blissful existence, one must hear about 
the pastimes of Lord Kr�pa and chant the mahiimantra, Hare Kr�pa, 
354 
Kf�!la, the Supreme Personality of Godhead 
Hare Krwa, Kr�!la Kr�!la, Hare Hare/Hare Rama, Hare Rama, Rama Rama, 
Hare Hare. 
The transcendental pastimes of the Supreme Personality of Godhead 
Kr�!la are so powerful that simply by hearing, reading and memorizing this 
book Krrcw, one is sure to be transferred to the spiritual world, which is 
ordinarily very difficult to achieve. The description of the pastimes of 
Lord Kr�!la is so attractive that automatically it gives us an impetus to 
study repeatedly, and the more we study the pastimes of the Lord, the 
more we become attached to Him. This very attachment to Kr�!la makes 
one eligible to be transferred to His abode, Goloka V rndavana. As we have 
learned from the previous chapter, to cross over the material world is to 
cross over the stringent laws of material nature. The stringent laws of 
material nature cannot check the progress of one who is attracted by the 
spiritual nature. This is confirmed in the Bhagavad-gitii by the Lord Him­
self: although the stringent laws of material nature are very difficult to 
overcome, if anyone surrenders unto the Lord, he can very easily cross 
over nescience. There is, however, no influence of material nature in the 
spiritual world. As we have learned from the Second Canto of Srimad'" 
Bhiigavatam, the ruling power of the demigods and the influence of 
material nature are conspicuous by their absence in the spiritual world. 
Srila Sukadeva Gosvami has therefore advised Maharaja Parilqit in the 
beginning of the Second Canto that every conditioned soul should engage 
himself in hearing and chanting the transcendental pastimes of the Lord. 
Srila Sukadeva Gosvami also informed King Parik�it that previously many 
other kings and emperors went to the jungle to prosecute severe austerities 
and penances in order to go back home, back to Godhead. In India, it is 
still a practice that many advanced transcendentalists give up their family 
lives and go to Vrndavana to live there alone and completely engage in 
hearing and chanting of the holy pastimes of the Lord. This system 
is recommended in the Srimad-Bhiigavatam, and the six Gosvamis of 
V rndavana followed it, but at the present moment many karmis and 
pseudo-devotees have overcrowded the holy place of Vrndavana just to 
imitate this process recommended by Sukadeva Gosvami. It is said that 
many kings and emperors formerly went to the forest for this purpose, but 
Srila Bhaktisiddhanta Sarasvati Thakur Gosvami Maharaja does not recom­
mend that one take up this solitary life in Vrndavana prematurely. 
One who goes prematurely to V rndavana to live in pursuance of the 
instructions of Sukadeva Gosvami again falls a victim of miiyii, even while 
residing in Vrndavana. To check such unauthorized residence in Vrndavana, 
Srila Bhaktisiddhanta Sarasvati Thakur has sung a nice song in this 
Summary Description of Lord Kr�!la's Pastimes 
355 
connection, the purport of which is as follows: "My dear mind, why are 
you so proud of being a Vai�!lava? Your solitary worship and chanting of 
the holy name of the Lord are based on a desire for cheap popularity, and 
therefore your chanting of the holy name is only a pretension. Such an 
ambition for a cheap reputation can be compared to the stool of a hog 
because such popularity is another extension of the influence of maya." 
One may go to Vrndavana for cheap popularity, and instead of being 
absorbed in Kr�!la consciousness, one may always think of money and 
women, which are simply temporary sources of happiness. It is better that 
one engage whatever money and women he may have in his possession in 
the service of the Lord because sense enjoyment is not for the conditioned 
soul. 
The master of the senses is Hrsikesa, Lord Krsna. Therefore, the senses 
. . 
. .. 
should always be engaged in His service. As for material reputation, there 
were many demons like Rava!la who wanted to go against the laws of 
material nature, but they all failed. One should therefore not take to the 
demoniac activity of claiming to be a V ai�!lava just for false prestige, with­
out performing service to the Lord. But when one engages oneself in the 
devotional service of the Lord, automatically the V ai�!lava reputation 
comes to him. There is no need to be envious of the devotees who are 
engaged in preaching the glories of the Lord. We have practical experience 
of being advised by the so-called biibajis in V rndavana that there is no 
need to preach and that it is better to live in V rndavana in a solitary place 
and chant the holy name. Such babiijis do not know that if one is engaged 
in preaching work or in glorifying the Supreme Personality of Godhead, 
the good reputation of a preacher automatically follows one. One should 
not, therefore, prematurely give up the honest life of a householder to 
lead a life of debauchery in Vrndavana. Sn,a Sukadeva Gosvami's recom­
mendation to leave home and go to the forest in search of Kr�!la is not for 
immature persons. Maharaja PanK�it was mature. Even in his householder 
life, or from the very beginning of his life, he worshiped Lord Kr�!la's 
milrti. In his childhood he worshiped the Deity of Lord Kr�!la, and later, 
although he was a householder, he was always detached, and therefore 
when he got the notice of his death, he immediately gave up all connection 
with household life and sat down on the bank of the Ganges to hear 
Srimad-Bhiigavatam in the association of devotees . 
. Thus ends the Bhaktivedanta purport of the Ninetieth Chapter of 
Kr�!la, "Summary Description of Lord Knrw's Pastimes." 
Thus ends Volume Two of Krwa, the Supreme Personality of Godhead.

KRSNA 
The Supreme Per;��ali ty of Godhead 
The most comprehensive and authoritative Vedic 
scriptural litera ture is the Snmad-
Bhiigavatam (the Beautiful Story of the Personality of Godhead), the mature contribution 
of-
rila Vyasadeva, the compiler of the Vedas. 
Of the twelve cantos of the Snmad-
Bhiigavatam, 
the Tenth Canto is considered· the most confidential, 
since it describes 
the transcendental pastimes of Sri Kf�l)a, 
the Persorality of Godhead. Kmw is a 
summary study of the Tenth Canto of 
Snmad-Bhiigavatam. 
Sukadeva Gosvaml, the original speaker 
of Snmad-Bhiigavatam, has declared that 
there are three classes of men and that 
the pastimes of Kr�'!a will be relished by 
) 
' 
each of them. 
The liberated soul who is 
no longer interested in mundane topics 
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami 
most certainly hears about Kr�'!a with 
the highest pleasure. The person who is trying to become liberated will also enjoy these 
topics of the Personality of Godhead, which purify anyone who hears them. And even the 
gross materialist will enjoy hearing about Kr�'!a because of the resemblance between His 
affairs with the gopis and the loving affairs of ordinary boys and girls. 
This presentation 
of the pastimes of Kr�'!a is a rare opportunity for all mankind to become attracted to the 
trans�.:endental world of the Personality of Godhead and to thus derive the highest benefit.
