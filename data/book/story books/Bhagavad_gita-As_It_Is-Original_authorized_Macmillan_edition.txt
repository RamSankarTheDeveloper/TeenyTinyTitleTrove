Foreword 
The Bhagavad�gitii is the best known and the most frequently translated 
of Vedic religious texts. Why it should be so appealing to the Western mind 
is an interesting question. It has drama, for its setting is a scene of two great 
armies, banners flying, drawn up opposite one another on the field, poised 
for battle. It has ambiguity, and the fact that Arjuna and his charioteer 
.Kr�r;ta are carrying on their dialogue between the two armies suggests the 
indecision of Arjuna about the basic question: should he enter battle 
against and kill those who are friends and kinsmen? It has mystery, as 
.Kr�r;ta demonstrates to. Arjuna His. cosmic form. It has a properly com­
plicated view of the ways of the religious life and treats of the paths of 
knowledge, works, discipline and faith and their inter-relationships, prob­
lems that have bothered adherents of other religions in other times and 
places. The devotion spoken of is a deliberate means of religious satisfaction, 
not a mere outpouring of poetic emotion. Next to the Bhiigavata-puriirw, a 
long work from South India, the GTtii is the text most frequently quoted 
in the philosophical writings of the Gaw;liya V ai�r;tava school, the school 
represented by Swami Bhaktivedanta as the latest in a long succession of 
teachers. It can be said that this school of V ai�r;tavism was founded, or 
revived, by Sri .Kr�r;ta-Caitanya Mahaprabhu (1486-1533) in Bengal, and 
that it is currently the strongest single religious force in the eastern part of 
the Indian subcontinent. The GauQiya V ai�r;tava school, for whom .Kr�r;ta 
is Himself the Supreme God, and not merely an incarnation of another 
deity, sees bhakti as an immediate and powerful religious force, consisting 
of love between man and God. Its discipline consists of devoting all one's 
actions to the Deity, and one listens to the stories of .Kr�r;ta from the sacred 
texts, one chants .Kr�r;ta 's name, washes, bathes, and dresses the murti of 
.Kr�r;ta, feeds Him and takes the remains of the food offered to Him, thus 
absorbing His grace; one does these things and many more, until one has 
been changed: the devotee has become transformed into one close to 
.Kr�r;ta, and sees the Lord face to face. 
Swami Bhaktivedanta comments upon the Gitii from this point of view, 
and that is legitimate. More than that, in this translation the Western 
reader has the unique opportunity of seeing how a Krsna devotee interprets 
his own texts. It is the Vedic exegetical tradition, justly famous, in action. 
This book is then a welcome addition from many points of view. It can 
serve as a valuable textbook for the college student. It allows us to listen to 
ix 
X 
a skilled inter:preter explicating a text which has profound religiou,s mean­
ing. It gives us insights into the original and highly convincing ideas of the 
Gaw;liya Vai�Qava school. In providing the Sanskrit in both Devanagari 
and transliteration, 
it offers the Sanskrit specialist the opportunity 
to 
re-interpret, 
or 
debate 
particular 
Sanskrit 
meanings-although· I 
think there will be little disagreement about the quality of the Swami's 
Sanskrit scholarship. And finally, for the nonspecialist, there is readable 
English and a devotional attitude which cannot help but move the sensitive 
reader. And there are the paintings, which, incredibly as it may seem to 
those familiar with contemporary Indian religious art, were done by 
American devotees. 
The scholar, the student of Gaw;liya Vai�l).avism, and, the increasing 
number of Western readers interested in classical Vedic thought have been 
done a service by Swami Bhaktivedanta. By bringing us a new and living 
interpretation of a text already known to many, he has increased our 
understanding manyfold; and arguments for understanding, in these days 
of estrangement, need not be made.

Preface 
Originally I wrote Bhagavad-gitii As It Is in the form in which it is pre­
sented now. When this book was first published, the original manuscript 
was, unfortunately, cut short to less than 400 pages, without illustrations 
and without explanations for most of the original verses of the Srimad 
Bhagavad-gitii. 
In 
all 
of 
my 
other books-Srimad Bhiigavatam, Sri 
lsopani�ad, etc.-the system is that I give the original verse, its English 
transliteration, word-for-word Sanskrit-English equivalents, translations 
and purports. This makes the book very authentic and scholarly and makes 
the meaning self-evident. I was not very happy, therefore, when I had to 
minimize my original manuscript. But later on, when the demand for 
Bhagavad-gitii As It Is considerably increased, I was requested by many 
scholars and devotees to present the book in its original form, and 
Messrs. Macmillan and Co. agreed to publish the complete edition. Thus 
the present attempt is to offer the original manuscript of this great book of 
knowledge with full parampara explanation in order to establish the Kf�l).a 
consciousness movement more soundly and progressively. 
Our Kr�tJa consciousness movement is genuine, historically authorized, 
natural and transcendental due to its being based on Bhagavad-gitii As It Is. 
It is gradually becoming the most popular movement in the entire world, 
especially amongst the younger generation. It is becoming more and more 
interesting to the older generation also. Older gentlemen are becoming 
interested, so much so that the fathers and grandfathers of my disciples 
are encouraging us by becoming life members of our great society, the 
International Society for Krishna Consciousness. In Los Angeles many 
fathers and mothers used to come to see me to express their feelings of 
gratitude for my leading the Kr�tJa consciousness movement throughout 
the entire world. Some of them said that it is greatly fortunate for the 
Americans that I have started the Kr�tJa consciousness movement in 
America. But actually the original father of this movement is Lord Kr�tJa 
Himself, since it was started a very long time ago but is coming down to 
human society by disciplic succession. If I have any credit in this connec­
tion, it does not belong to me personally, but it is due to my eternal 
spiritual master, His Divine Grace Om Vi�l)upada Paramahamsa Parivra­
jakacarya 108 Sri Srimad Bhaktisiddhanta Sarasvatl Gosvami Maharaja 
Prabhupada. 
Xl 
xu 
Bhagavad-g1ta As .It Is 
If personally I have any credit in this matter, it is only that I have tried 
to present Bhagavad-gitii as it is, without adulteration. Before my presen­
tation of Bhagavad-gitii As It Is, almost all the English editions of Bhagavad­
gitii were introduced to fulfill someone's personal ambition. But our 
attempt, in presenting Bhagavad-gitii As It Is, is to present the mission of 
the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Kr�J1a. Our business is to present 
the will of Kr�J1a, not that of any mundane speculator like the politician, 
philosopher or scientist, for they have very little knowledge of Kr�J1a, 
despite all their other knowledge. When Kr�11a says, man-mana bhava mad­
bhakto mad-yiiji !tliirh namaskuru, etc., we, unlike the so-called scholars, 
do not say that Kr�11a and His inner spirit are different. Kr�11a is absolute, 
and there is no difference between Kr�11a's name, Kr�11a's form, Kr�11a's 
quality, Kr�11a 's pastimes, etc. This absolute position of Kr�11a is difficult 
to understand for any p6rson who is not a devotee of Kr�11a in the param­
parii ( disciplic succession) system. Generally the so-called scholars, politi­
cians, philosophers, and sviimis, without perfect knowledge of Kr�J1a, try 
to banish or kill Kr�11a when writing commentary on Bhagavad-gitii. Such 
unauthorized commentary upon Bhagavad-gitii is known as Miiyiiviidi­
Bhii�ya, and Lord Caitanya has warned us about these unauthorized men. 
Lord Caitanya clearly says that anyone who tries to understand Bhagavad­
gitii from the Mayavadi point of view will commit a great blunder. The 
result of such a blunder will be that the misguided student of Bhagavad­
gitii will certainly be bewildered on the path of spiritual guidance and will 
not be able to go back home, back to Godhead. 
Our only purpose is to present this Bhagavad-gitii As It Is in order to 
guide the conditioned student to the same purpose for which Kr�11a de­
scends to this planet once in a day of Brahma, or every 8,600,000,000 
years. This purpose is stated in Bhagavad-gitii, and we have to accept it as 
it is; otherwise there is no point in trying to understand the Bhagavad-gitii 
and its speaker, Lord Kr�J1a. Lord Kr�11a first spoke Bhagavad-gitii to the 
sun-god some hundreds of millions of years ago. We have to accept this 
fact and thus understand the historical significance of Bhagavad-gitii, with­
out misinterpretation, on the authority of KwJ.a. To interpret Bhagavad­
gitii without any reference to the will of Kr�Q.a is the greatest offense. In 
order to save oneself from this offense, one has to understand the Lord as 
the Supreme Personality of Godhead, as He was directly understood by 
Arjuna, Lord Kr�Q.a's first disciple. Such understanding of Bhagavad-gitii 
is really profitable and authorized for the welfare of human society in ful­
filling the mission of life. 
The Kr�Q.a consciousness movement is essential in human society, for it 
offers the highest perfection of life. How this is so is explained fully in the 
Preface 
xm 
Bhagavad-gita. Unfortunately, mundane wranglers have taken advantage of 
Bhagavad-gita to push forward their demonic propensities and mislead 
people regarding right understanding of the simple principles of life. Every­
one should know how God or Kr�Qa is great, and everyone should know 
. the factual position of the living entities. Everyone should know that a liv­
ing entity is eternally a servant and that unless one serves Kr�Qa one has 
to serve illusion in different varieties of the three modes of material nature, 
and thus perpetually one has to wander within the cycle of birth and 
death; even the so-called liberated Mayavadi speculator has to undergo 
this process. This knowledge constitutes a great science, and each and every 
living being has to hear it for his own interest. 
People in general, especially in this age of Kali, are enamored by the 
external energy of Kr�Qa, and they wrongly think that by advancement of 
material comforts every man will be happy. They have no knowledge that 
the material or external nature is very strong, for everyone is strongly 
bound by the stringent laws of material nature. A living entity is happily 
the part and parcel of the Lord, and thus his natural function is to render 
immediate service to the Lord. By the spell of illusion one tries to be 
happy by serving his personal sense gratification in different forms which 
will never make him happy. Instead of satisfying his own personal material 
senses, he has to satisfy the senses of the Lord. That is the highest perfec­
tion of life. The Lord wants this, and He demands it. One has to under­
stand this central point of Bhagavad-gita. Our Kr�Qa consciousness move­
ment is teaching the whole world this central point, and because we are 
not polluting the theme of Bhagavad-gita As It Is, anyone seriously inter­
ested in deriving benefit by studying the Bhagavad-gita must take help 
from the Kr�Qa consciousness movement for practical understanding of 
Bhagavad-gita under the direct guidance of the Lord. We hope, therefore, 
that people will derive the greatest benefit by studying Bhagavad-gita 
As It Is as we have presented it here, and if even one man becomes a pure 
devotee of the Lord we shall consider our attempt a success.

Introduction 
3 
Bhagavad-gitii is also known as Gitopani§ad. It is the essence·of Vedic 
knowledge and one of the most important Upani§ads in Vedic literature. 
Of course there are many commentaries in English on the Bhagavad-gitii, 
and one may question the necessity for another one. This present edition 
can be explained in the following way. Recently an American lady asked 
me to recommend an English translation of Bhagavad-gitii. Of course in 
America there are so many editions of Bhagavad-gitii available in English, 
but as far as I have seen, not only in America but also in India, none of 
them can be strictly said to be authoritative because in almost every one 
of them the commentator has expressed his own opinions without touch­
ing the spirit of Bhagavad-gitii as it is. 
The spirit of Bhagavad-gitii is mentioned in Bhagavad-gitii itself. It is 
just like this: if we want to take a particular medicine, then we have -to 
follow the directions written on the label. We cannot take the medicine 
according to our own whim or the direction of a friend. It must be taken 
according to the directions on the label or the directions given by a 
physician. Similarly, Bhagavad-gitii should be taken or accepted as it is 
directed by the speaker himself. The speaker of Bhagavad-gitii is Lord Sri 
Kr��a. He is mentioned on every page of Bhagavad-gitii as the Supreme 
Personality of Godhead, Bhagavan. Of course the word "bhagaviin" some­
times refers to any powerful person or any powerful demigod, and certain­
ly here Bhagavan designates Lord Sri Kr��a as a great personality, but at the 
same time we should know that Lord Sri Kr��a is the Supreme Personality 
of Godhead, as is confirmed by all great iiciiryas (spiritual masters) like 
Sankaracarya, Ramanujacarya, Madhvacarya,Nimbarka Svam1, Sri Caitanya 
Mahaprabhu and many other authorities of Vedic knowledge in India. 
The Lord Himself also establishes Himself as the Supreme Personality of 
Godhead in the Bhagavad-gitii, and He is accepted as such in the Brahma­
samhitii and all the Puriirtas, especially the Srimad-Bhiigavatam, known as 
the Bhiigavata Puriirta (Kr§rtas tu bhagaviin svayam). Therefore we should 
take Bhagavad-gitii as it is directed by the Personality of Godhead Himself. 
In the Fourth Chapter of the Gitii the Lord says: 
(l) imam vivasvate yogam proktaviin aham avyayam 
vivasviin manave priiha manur ik§viikave 'bravit 
(2) evam paramparii-priiptam imam riijar§ayo vidu�­
sa kiileneha mahatii yogo na§ta� parantapa 
(3) sa eviiyam maya te 'dya yoga� prokta� puriitana� 
bhakto 'si me sakha ceti rahasyam hy etad uttamam 
4 
Bhagavad-glta As It Is 
Here the Lord informs Arjuna that this system of yoga, the Bhagavad­
gitii, was first spoken to the sun-god, and the sun-god explained it to Manu, 
and Manu explained it to Ik�vaku, and in that way, by disciplic succession, 
one speaker after another, this yoga system has been coming down. But 
in the course of time it has become lost. Consequently the Lord has to 
speak it again, this time to Arjuna on the Battlefield of Kuruk�etra. 
· 
He tells Arjuna that He is relating this supreme secret to him because he 
is His devotee and His friend. The purport of this is that Bhagavad-gitii is 
a treatise which is especially meant for the devotee of the Lord. There 
are three classes of transcendentalists, namely the jniin� the yogi and the 
bhakta, or the impersonalist, the meditator and the devotee. Here the 
Lord clearly tells Arjuna that He is making him the first receiver of a new 
paramparii (disciplic succession) because the old succession was broken. 
It was the Lord's wish, therefore, to establish another paramparii in the 
same line of thought that was coming down from the sun-god to others, 
and it was His wish that His teaching be distributed anew by Arjuna. He 
wanted Arjuna to become the authority in understanding the Bhagavad­
gitii. So we see that Bhagavad-gitii is instructed to Arjuna especially because 
Arjuna was a devotee of the Lord, a direct student of Kr��a, and His 
intimate friend. Therefore Bhagavad-gitii is best understood by a person 
who has qualities similar to Arjuna's. That is to say he must be a devotee 
in a direct relationship with the Lord. As soon as one becomes a devotee 
of the Lord, he also has a direct relationship with the Lord. That is a 
very elaborate subject matter, but briefly it can be stated that a devotee 
is in a relationship with the Supreme Personality of Godhead in one of 
five different ways: 
l. One may be a devotee in a passive state; 
2. One may be a devotee in an active state; 
3. One may be a devotee as a friend; 
4. One may be a devotee as a parent; 
5. One may be a devotee as a conjugal lover. 
Arjuna was in a relationship with the Lord as friend. Of course there is 
a gulf of difference between this friendship and the friendship found in 
the material world. This is transcendental friendship which cannot be had 
by everyone. Of course everyone has a particular relationship with the 
Lord, and that relationship is evoked by the perfection of devotional 
service. But in the present status of our life, we have not only forgotten 
the Supreme Lord, but we have forgotten our eternal relationship with 
Introduction 
5 
the Lord. Every living being, out of many, many billions and trillions of 
living beings, has a particular relationship with the Lord eternally. That is 
called svariipa. By the process of devotional service, one can revive that 
svariipa, and that stage is called svariipa·siddhi -perfection of one's con­
stitutional position. So Arjuna was a devotee, and he was in touch with 
the Supreme Lord in friendship. 
How Arjuna accepted this Bhagavad-gitii should be noted. His manner 
of acceptance is given in the Tenth Chapter. 
(12) arjuna uviica 
param brahma param dhiima pavitram paramam bhaviin 
puru§arh siisvatam divyam iidi-devam ajam vibhum 
(13) iihus tviim [§ayafl. sarve devar§ir niiradas tathii 
asito devalo vyiisafl. svayam caiva bravi§i me 
(14) sarvam etad rtam manye yan miim vadasi kesava 
na hi te bhagavan vyaktim vidur devii na diinaviifl. 
"Arjuna said: You are the Supreme Brahman, the ultimate, the supreme 
abode and purifier, the Absolute Truth and the eternal Divine Petson. 
You are the primal God, transcendental and original, and You are the 
unborn and all-pervading beauty. All the great sages like Narada, Asita, 
Devala, and Vyasa proclaim this of You, and now You Yourself are 
declaring itto me. 0 Kr�IJ.a, I totally accept as truth all that You have told 
me. Neither the gods nor demons, 0 Lord, know Thy personality." (Bg. 
10.12-14). 
After hearing Bhagavad-gitii from the Supreme Personality of Godhead, 
Arjuna accepted Kr��a as Param Brahma, the Supreme Brahman. Every 
living being is Brahman, but the supreme living being, or the Supreme 
Personality of Godhead, is the Supreme Brahman. Param dhiima means 
that He is the supreme rest or abode of everything, pavitram means that 
He is pure, untainted by material contamination, puru§am means that He 
is the supreme enjoyer, divyam, transcendental, iidi-devam, the Supreme 
Personality of Godhead, ajam, the unborn, and vibhum, the greatest, the 
all-pervading. 
Now one may think that because Kr��a · was the friend of Arjuna, 
Arjuna was telling Him all this by way of flattery, but Arjuna, just to 
drive out this kind of doubt from the minds of the readers of Bhagavad­
gitii, substantiates these praises in the next verse when he says that Kr��a 
6 
Bhagavad-gita As It Is 
is accepted as the Supteme Personality of Godhead not only by himself 
but by authorities like the sage Niirada, Asita, Devala, Vyiisadeva and so 
on. These are great personalities who distribute the Vedic knowledge as it 
is accepted by all iiciiryas. Therefore Arjuna tells Kr�!la that he accepts 
whatever He says to be completely perfect. Sarvarri etad rtam manye: "I 
accept everything You say to be true." Arjuna also says that the personality 
of the Lord is very difficult to understand and that He cannot be known 
even by the great demigods. This means that the Lord cannot even b� 
known by personalities greater than human beings. So how can a human 
being understand Sri Kr�!la without becoming His devotee? 
Therefore Bhagavad-gitii should be taken up in a spirit of devotion. One 
should not think that he is equal to Kr�!la, nor should he think that Kr�!!a 
is an ordinary personality or even a very great personality. Lord Sri Kr�!la 
is the Supreme Personality of Godhead, at least theoretically, according to 
the statements of Bhagavad-gitii or the statements of Arjuna, the person 
who is trying to understand the Bhagavad-gitii. We should therefore at 
least theoretically accept Sri Kr�!!a as the Supreme Personality of Godhead, 
and with that submissive spirit we can understand the Bhagavad�gita. 
Unless one reads the Bhagavad-gitii in a submissive spirit, it is very difficult 
to understand Bhagavad-gitii because it is a great mystery. 
Just what is the Bhagavad-gitii? The purpose of Bhagavad-gitii is to deliver 
mankind from the nescience of material existence. Every man is in difficulty 
in so many ways, as Arjuna also was in difficulty in having to fight the 
Battle of Kuruk�etra. Arjuna surrendered unto Sri Kr�pa, and consequently 
this Bhagavad-gitii was spoken. Not only Arjuna, but every one of us is full 
of anxieties because of this material existence. Our very existence is in the 
atmosphere of nonexistence. Actually we are not meant to be threatened 
by nonexistence. Our existence is eternal. But somehow or other we are 
put into asat. Asat refers to that which does not exist. 
Out of so many human beings who are suffering, there are a few who are 
actually inquiring about their position, as to what they are, why they are 
put into this awkward position and so on. Unless one is awakened.to this 
position -of questioning his suffering, unless he realizes that he doesn't 
want suffering but rather wants to make a solution to all sufferings, then 
one is not to be considered a perfect human being. Humanity begins 
when this sort of inquiry is awakened in one's mind. In the Brahma-siitra 
this inquiry is called "brahma-jijjiiiisii." Every activity of the human being 
is to be considered a failure unless he inquires about the nature of the 
Absolute. Therefore those who begin to question why they are suffering 
or where they came from and where they shall go after death are proper

students for understanding Bhagavad-gita. The sincere student should also 
have a firm respect for · the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Such a 
student was Arjuna. 
Lord 
Kr�J)a descends specifically to reestablish the real purpose 
of life when man forgets that purpose. Even then, out of many, many 
human beings 
who awaken, there may be one who actually enters 
the spirit of understanding his position, and for him this Bhagavad­
gitii is spoken. Actually we are all followed by the tiger of nescience, 
but the Lord is very merciful upon living entities, especially human 
beings. To this end He spoke the Bhagavad-gitii, making His friend 
A�una His student. 
Being an associate of Lord Kf�!J.a, Arjuna was above all ignorance, but 
Arjuna was put into ignorance on the Battlefield of Kuruk�etra just to 
question Lord Kr�rta about the problems of life so that the Lord could 
explain them for the benefit of future generations of human beings and 
chalk out the plan of life. Then man could act accordingly and perfect the 
mission of human life. 
· 
The subject of the Bhagavad-gitii entails the comprehension of five 
basic truths. First of all, the science of God is explained and then the 
constitutional position of the living entities, jivas. There is isvara, which 
means controller, and there are jivas, the living entities which are controlled. 
If a living entity says that he is not controlled but that he is free, then he 
is insane. The living being is controlled in every respect, at least in his 
conditioned life. So in the Bhagavad-gita the subject matter deals with the 
iSvara, the supreme controller, and the jivas, the controlled living entities. 
Prakrti (material nature) and time (the duration of existence of the whole 
universe or the manifestation of material nature) and karma (activity) are 
also discussed. The cosmic manifestation is full of different activities. 
All living entities are engaged in different activities. From Bhagavad-gitii we 
must learn what God is, what the living entities are, what prakrti is, what 
the cosmic manifestation is and how it is controlled by time, and what the 
activities of the living entities are. 
Out of these five basic subject matters in Bhagavad-gita it is established 
that the Supreme Godhead, or Kr�!J.a, or Brahman, or supreme controller, 
or Paramlitma-you may use whatever name you like-is the greatest of all. 
The living beings are in -quality like the supreme controller. For instance, 
the Lord has control over the universal affairs, over material nature, etc., 
as will be explained in the later chapters of Bhagavad-gita. Material nature 
is not independent. She is acting under the directions of the Supreme Lord. 
As Lord Kr�rta says, "Prakrti is working under My direction." When we see 
8 
Bhagavad-g1ta As It Is 
I 
wonderful things happening in the cosmic nature, we should know that 
behind this cosmic manifestation there is a controller. Nothing could be 
manifested without being controlled. It is childish not to consider the 
controller. For instance, a child may think that an automobile is quite 
wonderful to be able to run without a horse or other animal pulling it, 
but a sarie man knows the nature of the automobile's engineering arrange­
ment. He always knows that behind the machinery there is a man, a driver. 
Similarly, the Supreme Lord is a driver under whose direction everything 
is working. Now the jivas, or the living entities, have been accepted by the 
Lord, as we will note in the later chapters, as His parts and parcels. A 
particle of gold is also gold, a drop of water from the ocean is also salty, 
and similarly, we the living entities, being part and parcel of the supreme 
controller, iSvara, or Bhagavan, Lord Sri Kr�!J.a, have all the qualities of the 
Supreme Lord in minute quantity because we .are minute iSvaras, sub­
ordinate iSvaras. We are trying to control nature, as presently we are trying 
to control space or planets, and this tendency to control is there because 
it is in Kr�!la. But although we have a tendency to lord it over material 
nature, we should know that we are not the supreme controller. This is 
explained in Bhagavad-gitii. 
What is material nature? This is also explained in Gitii as inferior 
prakrti, inferior nature. The living entity is explained as the superior 
prakrti. Prakrti is always under control, whether inferior or superior. 
Prakrti is female, and she is controlled by the Lord just as the activities of 
a wife are controlled by the husband. Prakrti is always subordinate., 
predominated by the Lord, who is the predominator. The living entities 
and material nature are both predominated, controlled by the Supreme 
Lord. According to the Gitii, the living entities, although parts and parcels 
of the Supreme Lord, are to be considered prakrti. This is clearly mentioned 
in the Seventh Chapter, fifth verse of Bhagavad-gitii: ''A pare yam itas tv 
anyiim." "This prakrti is My lower nature." ''Prakrtim viddhi me pariim 
jiva-bhutiirh mahii-biiho yayedarh dhiiryate jagat." And beyond this there 
is another prakrti: jiva-bhutiim, the living entity. 
Prakrti itself is constituted by three qualities: the mode of goodness, the 
mode of passion and the mode of ignorance. Above these modes there is 
eternal time, and by a combination of these modes of nature and under 
the control and purview of eternal time there are activities which are called 
karma. These activities are being carried out from time immemorial, and 
we are suffering or enjoying the fruits of our activities. For instance, 
suppose I am a businessman and have worked very hard with intelligence 
and have amassed a great bank balance. Then I am an enjoyer. But then 
Introduction 
9 
say I have lost all my money in business; then I am a sufferer. Similarly, in 
every field of life we enjoy the results of our work, or we suffer the results. 
This is called karma. 
Isvara (the Supreme Lord), jiva (the living entity), prakrti (nature), 
eternal time and karma (activity) are all explained in the Bhagavad�gitii. 
Out of these five, the Lord, the living entities, material nature and time 
are eternal. The manifestation of prakrti may be temporary, but it is not 
false. Some philosophers say that the manifestation of material nature is 
false, but according to the philosophy of Bhagavad-gitii or according 
to the philosophy of the V ai�l).avas, this is not so. The manifestation of the 
world is not accepted as false; it is accepted as real, but temporary. It is 
likened unto a cloud which moves across the sky, or the coming of the 
rainy season which nourishes grains. As soon as the rainy season is over 
and as soon as the cloud goes away, all the crops which were nourished by 
the rain dry up. Similarly, this material manifestation takes place at a certain 
interval, stays for a while and then disappears. Such are the workings of 
prakrti. But this cycle is working eternally. Therefore prakrti is eternal; 
it is not false. The Lord refers to this as "My prakrti." This material 
nature is the separated energy of the Supreme Lord, and similarly the 
living entities are also the energy of the Supreme Lord, but they are not 
separated. They are eternally related. So the Lord, the living entity, 
material nature and time are all interrelated and are all eternal. However, 
the other item, karma, is not eternal. The effects of karma may be very old 
indeed. We are suffering or enjoying the results of our activities from time 
immemorial, but we can change the results of our karma, or our activity, 
and this change depends on the perfection of our knowledge. We are 
engaged in various activities. Undoubtedly we do not know what sort of 
activities we should adopt to gain relief from the actions and reactions of 
all these activities, but this is also explained in the Bhagavad-gitii. 
The position of isvara is that of supreme consciousness. The jivas, or the 
living entities, being parts and parcels of the Supreme Lord, are also 
conscious. Both the living entity and material nature are explained as 
prakrti, the energy of the Supreme Lord, but one of the two, the jiva, is 
conscious. The other prakrti is not conscious. That is the difference. 
Therefore the jiva-prakrti is called superior because the jiva has conscious­
ness which is similar to the Lord's. The Lord's is supreme consciousness, 
however, and one should not claim that the jiva, the living entity, is also 
supremely conscious. The living being cannot be supremely conscious at 
any stage of his perfection, and the theory that he can be so is a misleading 
theory. Conscious he may be, but he is not perfectly or supremely conscious. 
lO 
Bhagavad-gita As It Is 
The distinction between the jiva and the iSvara will be explained in the 
Thirteenth Chapter of Bhagavad-gita. The Lord is k�etra-jiia�, conscious, 
as is the living being, but the living being is conscious of his particular body, 
whereas the Lord is conscious of all bodies. Because He lives in the heart of 
every living being, He is conscious of the psychic movements of the 
particular jivas. We should not forget this. It is also explained that the 
Paramiitmii, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, is living in everyone's 
heart as isvara, as the controller, and that He is giving directions for the 
living entity to act as he desires. The living entity forgets what to do. First 
of all he makes a determination to act in a certain way, and then he is 
entangled in the acts and reactions of his own karma. After giving up one 
type of body, he enters another type of body, as we put on and take off 
old dothes. As the soul thus migrates, he suffers the actions and reactions 
of his past activities. These activities can be changed when the living being 
is in the mode of goodness, in sanity, and understands what sort of ac­
tivities he should adopt. If he does so, then all the actions and reactions of 
his past activities can be changed. Consequently, karma is not eternal. 
Therefore we stated that of the five items (iSvara, jiva, prakrti, time and 
karma) four are eternal, whereas karma is not eternal. 
The supreme conscious isvara is similar to the living entity in this way: 
both the consciousness of the Lord. and that of the .living entity are tran­
scendental. It is not that consciousness is generated by the association of 
matter. That is a mistaken idea. The theory that consciousness develops 
under certain circumstances of material combination is not accepted in 
the Bhagavad-gitii. Consciousness may be pervertedly reflected by the 
covering of mate11ial circumstances, just as light reflected through colored 
glass may appear to be a certain color, but the consciousness of the Lord is 
not materially affected. Lord Kr�:t:J.a says, "mayiidhyak�er-a prakrt*. "When 
He descends into the material universe, His consciousness is not materially 
affected. If He were so affected, He would be unfit to speak on transcen­
dental matters as He does in the Bhagavad-gitii. One cannot say anything 
about the transcendental world without being free· from materially con­
taminated consciousness. So the Lord is not materially contaminated. Our 
consciousness, at the present moment, however, is materially contami­
nated. The Bhagavad-gitii teaches that we have to purify this materially 
contaminated consciousness. In pure consciousness, our actions will be 
dovetailed to the will of isvara, and that will make us happy. It is not that 
we have to cease all activities. Rather, our activities are to be purified, and 
purified activities are called bhakti. Activities in bhakti appear to be like 
ordinary activities, but they are not contaminated. An ignorant person 
. 
Introduction

may se� that a devotee is acting or working like, an ordinary man, but 
such a person with a poor fund of knowledge does not know that the 
activities of the devotee or of the· Lord are not contaminated by impure 
consciousness or matter. They are transcendental to the three modes of 
nature. We should-know, however, that at this point our consciousness is 
contaminated. 
/ 
. 
, 
, 
. 
When we are materially contaminated, we are called conditioned: Fal�e 
consciousne_ss is exhibited under ,the impression that I am a product of 
mateqal nature. This is called false ego. One who is absorbed in tlie 
thought of bodily, conceptions cannot understand his situation. Bhagavad­
gita was spoke� to liberate one from the bodily conception of life, and 
· 
Arjll"na put himself in this _position in order to receive this information 
from the ·L ord. One must becOJp.e fi:ee from, the bodily conception of life;· 
that is the preliminary activity for the transcendentalist. Orie who w�nts 
to become free, who wants to becorne liberated, must first of all learn that 
he is not this material body. Mukti or libetatign mearis freedom from 
. material consciousness. In the Srimad-Bhiigavatam also the definition of 
liberation is given: Mukti means, liberation from the contaminated corr­
scious,ness of this material world and situation in pure consciousness. 
All the instructions of Bhagavad-gita are intended. to awaken �his pure · 
consciousness, and therefore we find,_�,tt the last stage of the Gita's 
instructions that K_r�I].a is asking Arjuna whether he is now in purified 
consciousness. Purified consciousness means acting ,in accordance with the 
instructions of the Lord. This is the whole sum a.nd substance of purified 
consciousness. Consciousness is already the;re be�ause we are part and 
parcel of the Lord, but for us there is the affinity of being affected by, the 
inferior modes. But -the Lord, being- the Supreme, is never affected. ' 
That is. the difference between the- Supreme Lord and the conditioned . 
souls. 
, 
What is this consciousness? This consciousness is "I .am." Then what am 
I? In contaminated cohs�iousness "� am" means "I am. the lord of all I .sur­
vey. I am the �njoyer.". The world revolves because.every living being thinks 
that he is the .lord and creator of the material world� Material consciousness 
has two psychic. divisions. One .is that I am the creator, and the other is 
that I ·am the enjoyer. But actually the Supreme·Lqrd is both the creator_ 
and the enjoyer,-and the living entity, being part a,ndparcel of the Supreme 
Lord, is neither the creator nor the enjoyer, but a cooperator. He is the 
created-and-the enjoyed. For instance, a.part of a machine cooperates with 
the whole machine; a'part,of the body· cooper,ates with the whole body. 
The hands, feet, eyes, legs and, so on are .all parts of the body: but. they 
-, 
't 
12 
Bhagavad-gita As It Is 
are not actually the enjoyers. The stomach is the enjoyer. The legs move, 
the hands supply food, the teeth chew and all parts of the body are engaged 
in satisfying the stomach because the stomach is the principal factor that 
nourishes the body's organization. Therefore everything is given to the 
stomach. One nourishes the tree by watering its root, and one nourishes 
the body by feeding the stomach, for if the body is to be kept in a healthy 
state, then the parts of the body must cooperate to feed the stomach. 
Similarly, the Supreme Lord is the enjoyer and the creator, and we, as 
subordinate living beings, are meant to cooperate to satisfy Him. This 
cooperation will actually help us, just as food taken by the stomach will 
help all other parts of the body. If the fingers of the hand think that they 
should take the food themselves instead of giving it to the stomach, then 
they will be frustrated. The central figure of creation and of enjoyment is 
the Supreme Lord, and the living entities are cooperators. By cooperation 
they enjoy. The relation is also like that of the master and the servant. If 
the master is fully satisfied, then the servant is satisfied. Similarly, the 
Supreme Lord should be satisfied, although the tendency to become the 
creator and the tendency to enjoy the material world are there also in 
the living entities because these tendencies are there in the Supreme Lord 
who has created the manifested cosmic world. 
We shall find, therefore, in this Bhagavad-gitii that the complete whole is 
comprised of the supreme controller, the controlled living_ entities, the cos­
mic manifestation, eternal time, and karma, or activities, and all of these are 
explained in this text. All of these taken completely form the complete 
whole, and the complete whole is called the Supreme Absolute Truth. 
The complete whole and the complete Absolute Truth are the Supreme 
Personality of Godhead, Sri K��I.J.a. All manifestations are due to His 
different energies. He is the complete whole. 
It is also explained in the Gitii that impersonal Brahman is also sub­
ordinate to the complete. Brahman is more explicitly explained in the 
Brahma-sutra to be like the rays of the sunshine. The impersonal 
Brahman is the shining rays of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. 
Impersonal Brahman is incomplete realization of the absolute whole, and 
so also is the conception of Paramatma in the Twelfth Chapter. There it 
shall be seen that the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Puru�ottama, is 
above both impersonal Brahman and the partial rflalization of Paramatma. 
The Supreme Personality of Godhead is called sac-cid-iinanda-vigraha. The 
Brahma-sarhhitii begins in this way: isvara[l, parama[l, lq�p,a[l, sac-cid-iinanda­
vigraha[l,/aniidir iidir govinda[l, sarva-l•iirap,a-kiirap,am. "Kr�l)a is the cause of

being, knowledge and bliss." Impersonal Brahman realization is the 
realization of His sat (being) feature. Paramatma realiz'ation is the 
realization of the cit (eternal knowledge)' feature. But realization of 
the Personality of Godhead, Kr�:t;ta, is realization of all the transcenden­
tal features: sat, cit and iinanda (being, knowledge, bliss) in complete 
vigraha (form). 
People with less intelligence consider the Supreme Truth to be imper­
sonal, but He is a transcendental person, and this is confirmed in all Vedic 
literatures. Nityo nityiiriiim cetanas cetaniiniim. As we are all individual 
living beings and have our individuality, ·the Supreme Absolute Truth. is 
also, in the ultimate issue, a person, and realization of the Personality of 
Godhead is realization of all of the transcendental features. The complete 
whole is not formless. if He is formless, or. if He is less than any other 
thing, then He cannot be the complete whole. The complete whole must 
have everything within, our experience and ·beyond our experience, other­
wise it cannot be complete. The complete whole, Personality of Godhead, 
has immense potencies. 
How Kr�!la is acting in different potencies is also explained in Bhagavad-
-
gitii. This phenomenal world or material world In which we are placed is 
also complete in itself because' the -twenty-four elements ef which 
this material universe. is 
a 
tempora:r'y- manifestation, 
according 
to·\ 
Sankhya philosophy, are completely adjusted to produce complete re-. 
sources which are necessary for the maintenance and subsistence of this 
universe. There is nothing extraneous; nor is there anything needed. This · 
manifestation has its own time fixed by the energy of the ·supreme whole, · 
and when its time is complete, these temporary/manifestations will be �nni; 
hilated by the complete arrangement of the coinplete. There is coii1plete· 
facility for the small complete units, namely the l�ving entities, to realize 
the complete, and all 'sorts of incompleteness. are experienced due to, 
incomplete knowledge of the complete. So Bhagavad-gitii conta.ins the 
. complete knowledge of Vedic wisdom. 
' 
All Vedic knowledge is infallible, and Hindus accept .Vedic knowled,g� 
to be complete and infallible. For example, cow dung is the stool of an:: 
' -
.animal, and according to smrti, or Vedic ·injunction, if one touches the 
stool of an animal he has to take a b�th to purify himself._ But in the Vedic 
scriptures cow dung is considered to be a purifying agent. One might 
consider this to be contradictory, but it is· ac-::epted beca:use it is Vedic 
injunction, and indeed-by accepting this, orie .will not commit· a mis�ake; 
· 
subsequently it has been proved by .modern science that cow dung con-· 
tains all antiseptic properties. So Vedic knowledge is complete because it 
·.· ,·.·· �· 
'.·
,· 
'·· 
14 
Bhagavad-gita As It Is 
is above all doubts and mistakes, and Bhagavad-gitii is the essence of all 
Vedic knowledge. 
Vedic knowledge is not a question of research. Our research work is 
imperfect because we are researching things with imperfect senses. We 
have to accept perfect knowledge which comes down, as is stated in 
Bhagavad-gitii, by the paramparii disciplic succession. We have to receive 
knowledge from the proper source in disciplic succession beginning with 
the supreme spiritual master, the Lord Himself, and handed down to a 
succession of spiritual masters. Arjuna, the student who took lessons from 
Lord Sri Kr��a, accepts everything that He says without contradicting 
Him. One is not allowed to accept one portion of Bhagavad-gitii and not 
another. No. We must accept Bhagavad-gitii without interpretation, with­
out deletion and without our own whimsical participation in the matter. 
The Gitii should be taken as the most perfect presentation of Vedic 
knowledge. Vedic knowledge is received from transcendental sources, and 
the first words were spoken by the Lord Himself. The words spoken by 
the Lord are different from words spoken by a person of the mundane 
world who is infected with four defects. A mundaner l) is sure to commit 
mistakes, 2) is invariably illusioned, 3) has the tendency to cheat others 
and 4) is limited by imperfect senses. With these four imperfections, one 
cannot deliver perfect information of all-pervading knowledge. 
Vedic knowledge is not imparted by such defective living entities. It was 
imparted unto the heart of Brahma, the first created living being, and 
Brahma in his turn disseminated this knowledge to his sons and disciples, 
as he originally received it from the Lord. The Lord is purr-am, all-perfect, 
and there is no possibility of His becoming subjected to the Jaws of material 
nature. One should therefore be intelligent enough to know that the Lord 
is the only proprietor of everything in the universe and that He is the 
original creator, the creator of Brahma. In the Eleventh Chapter the 
Lord is addressed as prapitiimaha because Brahma is addressed as pitiimaha, 
the grandfather, and He is the creator of the grandfather. So no one should 
claim to be the proprietor of anything; one should accept only things 
which are set aside for him by the Lord as his quota for his maintenance. 
There are many examples given of how we are to utilize those things 
which are set aside for us by the Lord. This is also explained in Bhagavad­
gitii. In the beginning, Arjuna decided that he should not fight in the 
Battle of Kuruk�etra. This was his own decision. Arjuna told the Lord that 
it was not possible for him to enjoy the kingdom after killing his own 
kinsmen. This decision was based on the body because he was thinking 
that the body was himself and that his bodily relations or expansions 
Introduction 
15 
were his brothers, nephews, brothers-in-law, grandfathers and so on. 
He was thinking in this way to satisfy his bodily demands. Bhagavad-gitii 
was spoken by the Lord just to change this view, and at the end Arjuna 
decides to fight under the directions of the Lord when he says, "kari�ye 
vacanam tava." "I shall act according to Thy word." 
In this world man is not meant to toil like hogs. He must be intelligent 
to realize the importance of human life and refuse to act like an ordinary 
animal. A human being should realize the aim of his life, and this direction 
is given in all Vedic literatures, and the essence is given in Bhagavad-gitii. 
Vedic literature is meant for human beings, not for animals. Animals can 
kill other living animals, and there is no question of sin on their part, but 
if a man kills an animal for the satisfaction of his uncontrolled taste, he 
must be responsible for breaking the laws of nature. In the Bhagavad-gitii 
it is clearly explained that there are three kinds of activities according to 
the different modes of nature: the activities of goodness, of passion and of 
ignorance. Similarly, there are three kinds of eatables also: eatables in good­
ness, passion and ignorance. All of this is clearly described, and if we 
properly utilize the instructions of Bhagavad-gitii, then our whole life will 
become purified, and ultimately we will be able to reach the destination 
which is beyond this material sky. 
That destination is called the saniitana sky, the eternal spiritual sky. In 
this material world we find that everything is temporary. It comes into 
being, stays for some time, produces some by-products, dwindles and then 
vanishes. That is the law of the material world, whether we use as an. 
example this body, or a piece of fruit or anything. But beyond this tempo­
rary world there is another world of which we have information. This 
world consists of another nature which is saniitana, eternal. ]iva is also 
described as saniitana, eternal, and the Lord is also described as saniitana 
in the Eleventh Chapter. We have an intimate relationship with the Lord, 
and because we are all qualitatively one-the saniitana-dhiima, or sky, the 
saniitana Supreme Personality and the saniitana living entities-the whole 
purpose of Bhagavad-gitii is to revive our saniitana occupation, or saniitana­
dharma, which is the eternal occupation of the living entity. We are tempo­
rarily engaged in different activities,. but all of these activities can be 
purified when we give up all these temporary activities and take up the 
activities which are prescribed by the Supreme Lord. That is called our 
pure life. 
The Supreme Lord and His transcendental abode are both saniitana, as 
are the living entities, and the combined association of the Supreme Lord 
and the living entities in the saniitana abode is the perfection of human 
16 
Bhagavad-g]ta As It Is 
life. The Lord is very kind to the living entities because they are His sons. 
Lord Kg;l).a declares in Bhagavad-gitii, "sarva-yon�u ... aharh bija-prada[l 
pita." "I am the father of all." Of course there are all types of living 
entities according to their various karmas, but here the Lord claims that 
He is the father of all of them. Therefore the Lord descends to reclaim all 
of these fallen, conditioned souls to call them back to the saniitana eternal 
sky so that the saniitana living entities may regain their eternal saniitana 
positions in eternal association with the Lord. The Lord comes Himself 
in different incarnations, or He sends His confidential servants as sons or 
His associates or iiciiryas to reclaim the conditioned souls. 
Therefore, saniitana-dharma does not refer to any sectarian process of 
religion. It is the eternal function of the eternal living entities in relation­
ship with the eternal Supreme Lord. Saniitana-dharma refers, as stated 
previously, to the eternal occupation of the living entity. Ramanujacarya 
has explained the word saniitana as "that which has neither beginning nor 
end," so when we speak of saniitana-dharma, we must take it for granted 
on the authority of Sri Ramanujacarya that it has neither beginning nor 
end. 
The English word "religion" is a little different from saniitana-dharma. 
Religion conveys the idea of faith, and faith may change. One may have 
faith in a particular process, and he may change this faith and adopt 
another, but saniitana-dharma refers to that activity which cannot be 
changed. For instance, liquidity cannot be taken from water, nor can heat 
be taken from fire. Similarly, the eternal function of the eternal living 
entity cannot be taken from the living entity.Saniitana-dharma is eternally 
integral with the living entity. When we speak of saniitana-dharma, there­
fore, we must take it for granted on the authority of Sri Ramanujacarya 
that it has neither beginning nor end. That which has neither end nor 
beginning must not be sectarian, for it cannot be limited by any boundaries. 
Yet those belonging to some sectarian faith will wrongly consider that 
saniitana-dharma is also sectarian, but if we go deeply into the matter and 
consider it in the light of modern science, it is possible for us to see that 
saniitana-dharma is the business of all the people of the world-nay, of all 
the living entities of the universe. 
Non-simiitana religious faith may have some beginning in the annals of 
human history, but there is no beginning to the history of saniitana-dharma 
because it remains eternally with the living entities. Insofar as the living 
entities are concerned, the authoritative siistras state that the living entity 
has neither birth nor death. In the Gitii it is stated that, the living entity 
is never born, and he never dies. He is eternal and indestructible, and he

continues to live after the destruction of his temporary material body. 
In reference to the concept of saniitana-dharma, we must try to under­
stand the concept of religion from the Sanskrit root meaning of the word. 
Dharma refers to that which is constantly existing with the particular 
object. We conclude that there is heat and light along with the fire; 
without heat and light, there is no meaning to the word fire. Similarly, we 
must discover the essential part of the living being, that part which is his 
constant companion. That constant companion is his eternal quality, and 
that eternal quality is his eternal religion. 
When Sanatana Gosvami asked Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu about the 
svariipa of every living being, the Lord replied that the svariipa or 
constitutional position of the living being is the rendering of service to the 
Supreme Personality of Godhead. If we analyze this statement of Lord 
Caitanya, we can easily see that every living being is constantly engaged 
in rendering service to another living being. A living being serves other 
living beings in two capacities. By doing so, the living entity enjoys life. The 
lower animals serve human beings as servants serve their master. A serves 
B master, B serves C master and C serves D master and so on. Under these 
circumstances, we can see that one friend serves another friend, the mother 
serves the son, the wife serves the husband, the husband serves the wife 
and so on. If we go on searching in this spirit, it will be seen that there is 
no exception in the society of living beings to the activity of service. The 
politician presents his manifesto for the public to conVince them of his 
capacity for service. The voters therefore give the politician their valuable 
votes, thinking that he will render valuable service to society. The shop­
keeper serves the customer, and the artisan serves the capitalist. The 
capitalist serves the family, and the family serves the state in the terms of 
the eternal capacity of the eternal living being. In this way we can see that 
no living being is exempt from rendering service to other living beings, 
and therefore we can safely conclude that service is the constant companion 
of the living being and that the rendering of service is the eternal religion 
of the living being. 
Yet man professes to belong to a particular type of faith with reference 
to particular time and circumstance and thus claims to be a Hindu, 
Muslim, Christian, Buddhist or any other sect. Such designations are non­
saniitana-dharma. A Hindu may change his faith to become a Muslim, or a 
Muslim may change his faith to become a Hindu, or a Christian may change 
his faith and so on. But in all circumstances the change of religious faith 
does not effect the eternal occupation of rendering service to others. The 
Hindu, Muslim or Christian in all circumstances is servant of -someone. 
18 
Bhagavad�glta As It Is 
Thus, to profess a particular type of sect is not to profess one's saniitana­
dharma. The rendering of service is saniitana-dharma. 
Factually we are related to the Supreme Lord in service. The Supreme 
Lord is the supreme enjoyer, and we living entities are His servitors. We are 
created for His enjoyment, and if we participate in that eternal enjoyment 
with the Supreme Personality of Godhead, we become happy. We cannot 
become happy otherwise. It is not possible to be happy independently, 
just as no one part of the body can be happy without cooperating with the 
stomach. It is not possible for the living entity to be happy without 
rendering transcendental loving service unto the Supreme Lord. 
In the Bhagavad-gitii, worship of different demigods or rendering service 
to them is not approved. It is stated in the Seventh Chapter, twentieth 
verse: 
kiimais tais tair hrt-ajiiiinii[l prapadyante 'nya-devatii[l 
tam tam niyamam iisthiiya prakrtyii niyatii[l svayii 
"Those whose minds are distorted by material desires surrender unto 
demigods and follow the particular rules and regulations of worship 
according to their own natures." (Bg. 7.20) Here it is plainly said that 
those who are directed by lust worship the demigods and not the Supreme 
Lord Kr�pa. When we mention the name Kr�pa, we do not refer to any 
·sectarian name. Kr�pa means the highest pleasure, and it is confirmed that 
the Supreme Lord is the reservoir or storehouse of all pleasure. We are all 
hankering after pleasure. Anandamayo'bhyiisiit. (Vs. 1.1.12) The living 
entities, like the Lord, are full of consciousness, and they are after 
happiness. The Lord is perpetually happy, and if the living entities associate 
with the Lord, cooperate with Him and take part in His association, then 
' 
they also become happy. 
The Lord descends to this mortal world to show His pastimes in 
Vrndavana, which are full of happiness. When Lord Sri Kr�pa was in 
Vrndavana, His activities with His cowherd boy friends, with His damsel 
friends, with the inhabitants of Vrndavana and with the cows were all full 
of happiness. The total population of V rndavana knew nothing but Kr�pa. 
But Lord Kr�pa even discouraged His father Nanda Maharaja from worship­
ing the demigod Indra because He wanted to establish the fact that people 
need not worship any demigod. They need only worship the Supreme 
Lord because their ultimate goal is to return to His abode. 
The abode of Lord Sri Krwa is described in the Bhagavad-gitii, Fifteenth 
Chapter, sixth verse: 
( 
Introduction 
19 
na tad bhiisayate siiryo na sasii:ftko na piivaka[l 
yad gatvii na nivartante tad dhiima paramam, mama 
"That abode of Mine is not illumined by the sun or moon, nor by 
electricity. And anyone who reaches it never comes back to this material 
world." (Bg. 15.6) 
This verse gives a description of that eternal sky. Of course we have a 
material conception of the sky, and we think of it in relationship to the 
sun, moon, stars and so on, but in this verse the Lord states that in the 
eternal sky there is no need for the sun nor for the moon nor fire of any 
kind because the spiritual sky is already illuminated by the brahmajyoti, 
the· rays emanating from the Supreme Lord. We are trying with difficulty 
to reach other planets, but it is not difficult to understand the abode of the 
Supreme Lord. This abode is referred to as Goloka. In the Brahma-samhitii 
it is beautifully described: Goloka eva nivasaty akhiliitma-bhiita[l. The Lord 
resides eternally in His abode Goloka, yet He can be approached from this 
world, and to this end the Lord comes to manifest His real form, sac-cid­
iinanda-vigraha. When He manifests this form, there is no need for our 
imagining what He looks like. To discourage such imaginative speculation, 
He descends and exhibits Himself as He is, as Syamasundara. Unfortunately, 
the less intelligent deride Him because He comes as one of. us and plays 
with us as a human being. But because of this we should not consider that 
the Lord is one of us. It is by His potency that He presents Himself in His 
real form before us and displays His pastimes, which are prototypes of 
those pastimes found in His abode. 
In the effulgent rays of the spiritual sky there are innumerable planets 
floating .. The brahmajyoti emanates from the supreme abode, Kr§Q.aloka, 
and the iinandamaya-cinmaya planets, which are not material, float in 
those rays. The Lord says, na tad bhiisayate siiryo na sasiiftko na piivaka[l 
yad gatvii na nivartante tad dhiima paramam mama. One who can approach 
that spiritual sky is not required to descend again to the material sky. In the 
material sky, even if we approach the highest planet (Brahmaloka), what to 
speak of the moon, we will find the same conditions of life, namely birth, 
death, disease and old age. No planet in the material universe is free from 
these four principles of material existence. Therefore the Lord says in 
Bhagavad-gitii, iibrahma-bhuvaniil lokii[l punar iivartino 'rjuna. The living en­
tities are traveling from one planet to another, not by mechanical arrange­
ment but by a spiritual process. This is also mentioned: yiinti deva-vratii 
deviin pitfn yiinti pitr-vratii[l. No mechanical arrangement is necessary if we 
want interplanetary travel. The Gitii instructs: yiinti deva-vratii deviin. The 
20 
Bhagavad-gita As It Is 
moon, the sun and higher planets are called svargaloka. There are three dif­
ferent statuses of planets: higher, middle and lower planetary systems. The 
earth belongs to the middle planetary. system. Bhagavad-gitii informs us how 
to travel to the higher planetary systems ( devalo�a) with a very simple for­
mula: yiinti deva-vratii deviin. One need only worship the particular demigod 
of that particular planet and in that way go to the moon, the sun or any 
of the higher planetary systems. 
Yet Bhagavad-gitii does not advise us to go to any of the planets in this 
material world because even if we go to Brahmaloka, the highest planet, 
through some sort of mechanical contrivance by maybe traveling. for 
forty thousand years (and who would live that long?), we will still find 
the material inconveniences of birth, death, disease and old age. But one 
who wants to approach the supreme planet, Kw·.taloka, or a:ny of the 
other planets within the spiritual sky, will not meet with these material 
inconveniences. Amongst all of the planets in the spiritual sky there is one 
supreme planet called Goloka V�ndavana, which is the ,original planet in 
the abode of the original Personality of Godhead Sri Kr�J).a. All of 
this information is given in Bhagavad-gitii, and we are given through its 
instruction information how to leave the material world and begin a truly 
blissful life in the spiritual sky. 
In the Fifteenth Chapter of the Bhagavad-gitii, the real picture of the 
material world is given. It is said there: 
urdhva-millam adha�-siikham asvattharh priihur avyayam 
chandiirhsi yasya parr-ani yas tam veda sa veda-vit 
"The Supreme Lord said: There is a banyan tree which has its roots 
upward and its branches down, and the Vedic hymns are its leaves. One 
who knows this tree is the knower of the Vedas." (Bg. 15.1) Here the 
material world is described as a tree whose roots are upwards and branches 
are below. We have experience of a tree whose roots are upward: if one 
stands on the bank of a river or any reservoir of water, he can see that the 
trees reflected in the water are upside down. The branches go downward 
and the roots upward. Similarly, this material world is a reflection of the
' 
spiritual world. The material world is but a shadow of reality. In the 
shadow there is no reality or substantiality, but from the shadow we can 
understand that there is substance and reality. In the desert there is .no 
water, but the mirage suggests that there is such a thing as water. In the 
material world there is no water, there is no happiness, but the real water 
of actual happiness is there in the spiritual world. 
Introduction 
21 ' 
The Lord suggests that we attain the spiritual world in the following 
manner: 
nirmiina-mohii jita-sanga-do§ii 
adh yiitma-nityii vinivrtta-kiimii� 
dvandvair vimuktii� S!-£kha-du�kha-samjiiair 
gacchanty amu{lhii� padam avyayam tat. 
That padam avyayam or eternal kingdom can be reached by one who 
is nirmiina-moha. 
What does this mean? We are after designations. 
Someone wants to become a son, someone wants to beco�e Lord, 
someone wants to become the president or a rich man or a king or some­
thing else. As long as we are attached to these designations, we are 
attached to the body because designations belong to the body. But we are 
not these bodies, and realizing this is the first stage in spiritual realization. 
We are associated with the three modes of material nature, but we must 
become detached through devotional service to the Lord. If we are not 
attached to devotional service to the Lord, then we cannot become 
detached from the modes of material nature. Designations and attachments 
are due to our lust and desire, our wanting to lord it over the material 
nature. As long as we do not give up this propensity of lording it over 
material nature, there is no possibility of returning to the kingdom of the 
Supreme, the saniitana-dhiima. That eternal kingdom, which is never 
destroyed, can be approached by one who is not bewildered by the attrac­
tions of false material enjoyments, who is situated in the service of the 
Supreme Lord. One so situated can easily approach that supreme abode. 
Elsewhere in the Gita it is stated: 
avyakto 'k§ara ity uktas tam iihu� paramiim gatim 
yam priipya na nivartante tad dhiima paramam mama. 
Avyakta means unmanifested. Not even all of the material world is mani­
fested before us. Our senses are so imperfect that we cannot even see all of 
the stars within this material universe. In Vedic literature we can receive 
much information about all the planets, and we can believe it or not believe 
it. All of the important planets are described in Vedic literatures, especially 
Srimad-BhiigaiJUtam, and the spiritual world, which is beyond this material 
sky, is described as avyakta, unmanifested. One should desire and hanker 
after that supreme kingdom, for when one attains that kingdom, he does 
not have to return to this material world. 
•• 
22 
Bhagavad-glta As It Is 
Next, one may raise the question of how one goes about approaching 
that abode of the Supreme Lord. Information of this is given in the 
Eighth Chapter. It is said there:-
anta-kiile ca miim eva smaran muktvii lcalevaram 
ya� prayiiti sa mad-bhiivam yiiti nasty atra sarhsaya� 
"Anyone who quits his body, at the end of life, remembering Me, attains 
immediately to My nature; and there is no doubt of this." (Bg. 8.5) 
One who thinks of Krg�a at the time of his death goes to Kr�!J.a. One must 
· remember the form of Kr�I:la; if he quits his body thinking of this form, he 
approaches the spiritual kingdom. Mad-bhiivarh refers to the supreme 
.nature of the Supreme Being. The Supreme Being is sac-cid-iinanda­
vigraha- eternal , full of knowledge and bliss. Our present body is not 
.sac-cid-iin,anda. It is asat, not sat. It is not eternal; it is perishable. It is not 
cit, full of knowledge, but it is full of ignorance. We have no knowledge of 
the spiritual kingdom, nor do we even have perfect knowledge of this 
material world where there are so many things unknown to us. The body 
is also niriinanda; instead of being full of bliss it is full of misery. All of the 
miseries we experience in the material world arise from the body, but one 
who leaves this body thinking of the Supreme Personality of Godhead at 
once attains a sac-cid-iinanda body, as is promised in this fifth verse of the 
Eighth Chapter where Lord Kr�!la says, "He attains My nature." 
The process of quitting this body and getting another body in the 
material world is also organized. A man dies after it has been decided 
what form of body he will have in the next life: Higher authorities, not the 
living entity himself, make this decision. According to our activities in 
this life, we either rise or sink. This life is a preparation for the next life. 
If we can prepare, therefore, in this life to get promotion to the kingdom 
of God, then surely, after quitting this material body, we will attain a 
spiritual body just like the Lord. 
As explained before, there are different kinds of transcendentalists, 
the brahmaviidi, paramiitmiiviidi, and the devotee, and, as mentioned, in 
the brahmajyoti (spiritual sky) there are innumerable spiritual planets. 
The number of these planets is far, far greater than all of the planets of 
this material world. This material world has been approximated as only 
one quarter of the creation. In this material segment there are millions and 
billions of universes with trillions of planets and suns, stars and moons. 
But this whole material creation is only a fragment of the total creation. 
Most of the creation is in the spiritual sky. One who desires to merge into 
Introduction 
23 
the existence of the Supreme Brahman is at once transferred to the 
brahmajyoti of the Supreme Lord and thus attains the spiritual sky. The 
· 
devotee, who wants to enjoy the association of the Lord, enters into the 
V aikutttha planets, which are innumerable, and the Supreme Lord by His 
plenary expansions as NarayaQ.a with four hands and with different names 
like Pradyumna, Aniruddha, Govinda, etc., associates with him there. 
Therefore at the end of life the transcendentalists either think of the 
brahmajyoti, the Paramatma or the Supreme Personality of Godhead 
Sri Kr�tta. In all cases they enter into the spiritual sky, but only . the 
devotee, or he who is in personal touch with the Supreme Lord, enters 
into the V aikutttha planets. The Lord further adds that of this "there is no 
doubt." This must be believed firmly. We should not reject that which 
does not tally with our imagination; our attitude should be that of 
Arjuna: "I believe everything that You have said." Therefore when the 
Lord says that at the time of death whoever thinks of Him as Brahman or 
Paramatma or as the Personality of Godhead certainly enters into the 
spiritual sky, there is no doubt about it. There is no question of dis· 
believing it: 
The information on how to think of the Supreme Being at the time of 
death is also given in the Gitii: 
yam yam viipi smaran bhiivam tyajaty ante kalevaram 
tam tam evaiti kaunteya sadii tad-bhiiva-bhiivita� 
"In whatever condition one quits his present body, in his next life he will 
attain to that state of being without fail." (Bg. 8.6) Material nature is a 
display of one of the energies of the Supreme Lord. In the Virpu Puriipa 
the total energies of the Supreme Lord as Vi�ru-sakt* parii proktii, etc., are 
delineated. The Supreme Lord has diverse and innumerable energies which 
are beyond our conception; however, great learned sages or liberated 
souls have studied these energies and have·analyzed them into three parts. 
All of the energies are of Vi§ru-sakti, that is to say they are different 
potencies of Lord Vi�ttu. That energy is parii, transcendental. Living 
entities also belong to the superior energy, as has already been explained. 
The other energies, or material energies, are in the mode of ignorance. At 
the time of death we can either remain in the inferior energy of this 
material world, or we can transfer to the energy of the spiritual world. 
In life we are accustomed to thinking either of the material or the 
spiritual energy. There are so many literatures which fill our thoughts 
with the material energy-newspapers, novels, etc. Our thinking, which is 
, .
.
 
24 
Bhagavad-glta As It Is 
now absorbed in these literatures, must be transferred to the Vedic litera­
tures. The great sages, therefore, have written so many Vedic literatures 
such as the Purii"!ws, etc. The Purii"t;ws are not imaginative; they are 
historical records. In the Caitanya-caritamrita there is the following verse: 
maya mugdha jiver nahi svatafl, kr�TJa-jfian 
jivera krpaya kailii kr�TJ-a veda-purii"{la 
(Cc_ Madhya 20.122) 
The forgetful living entities or conditioned souls have forgotten their 
relationship with the Supreme Lord, and they are engrossed in thinking 
of material activities. Just to transfer their thinking power to the spiritual 
sky, Krf?IJ.a has given a great number of Vedic literatures. First He divided 
the Vedas into four, then He explained them in the Pura"{las, and for less 
capable people He wrote the Mahiibhiirata. In the Mahiibhiirata there is 
given the Bhagavad-gita. Then all Vedic literature is summarized in the 
Vediinta-siitra, and for future guidance He gave a natural commentation 
on the Vedanta-siitra, called Srimad-Bhiigavatam. We must always engage 
our minds in reading these Vedic literatures. Just as materialists engage 
their minds in reading newspapers, magazines and so many materialistic 
literatures, we must transfer our reading to these literatures which are 
given to us by Vyasadeva; in that way it will be possible for us to remem­
ber the Supreme Lord at the time of death. That is the only way suggested 
by the Lord, arid He guarantees the result: "There is no doubt." (Bg. 8. 7) 
tasmat sarve§u kiile§u mam anusmara yudhya ca 
mayy arpita-mano-buddhir miim evai§yasy asamsayafl, 
"Therefore, Arjuna, you should always think of Me, and at the same time 
you should continue your prescribed duty and fight. With your mind and 
activities always fixed on Me, and everything engaged in Me, you will 
attain to Me without any doubt." 
He does not advise Arjuna to simply remember Him and give up his 
occupation. No, the Lord never suggests anything impractical. In this 
material world, in order to maintain the body one has to work. Human 
society is divided, according to work, into four divisions of social order­
briihma"(la, k§atriya, vaiSya, siid ra. The brahma"{la class or intelligent class 
is working in one way, the k§atriya or administrative class is working in 
another way, and the mercantile class and the laborers are all tending to 
their specific duties. In the human society, whether one is a laborer, 
merchant, warrior, administrator, or farmer, or even if one belongs to the 
highest class and is a literary man, a scientist or a theologian, he has to 
work in order to maintain his existence. The Lord therefore tells Arjuna 
that he need not give up his occupation, but while he is engaged in his 
--

25 
occupation he should remember Kr��a.lf he doesn't practice remembering 
Kr��a while he is struggling for existence, then it will not be possible for 
him to remember Kr��a at the time of death. Lord Caitanya also advises 
this. He says that one should practice remembering the Lord by chanting 
the names of the Lord always. The names of1the Lord and the Lord are 
nondifferent. So Lord Kr��a's instruction to Arjuna to "remember ,Me" 
and Lord Caitanya's injunction to always "chant the names of Lord 
Kr��a" are the same instruction. There is no difference, because Kr�!la and 
Kr��a 's name are nondifferent. In the absolute status there is no difference 
between reference and referent. Therefore we have to practice remember­
ing the Lord always, twenty-four hours a day, by chanting His names and 
molding our life's activities in such a way that we can remember Him 
always. 
How is this possible? The iiciiryas give the following example. If a 
married woman is attached to another man, or if a man has an attachment 
for a woman other than his wife, then the attachment is to be considered 
very strong. One with such an attachment is always thinking of the loved 
one. The wife who is thinking of her lover is always thinking of meeting 
him, even while she is carrying out her
' 
household chores. In fact, she 
carries out her household work even more carefully so her husband will not 
suspect her attachment. Similarly, we should always remember the supreme 
lover, Sri Kr��a, and at the same time perform our material duties very 
dcely. A strong sense of love is required here. If we have a strong sense of 
love for the Supreme Lord, then we can discharge our duty and at the 
same time remember Him. But we have to develop that sense of love. 
Arjuna, for instance, was always thinking of Kr��a; he was the constant 
companion of Kr��a, and at the same time he was a warrior. Kr��a did not 
advise him to give up fighting and go to the forest to meditate. When 
Lord Kr��a delineates the yoga system to Arjuna, Arjuna says that the 
practice of this system is not possible for him. 
arjuna uviica 
yo 'yam yogas tvayii prokta[l, siimyena madhusiidana 
etasyiiham na pasyiimi caiicalatviit sthitirh sthiriim 
"Arjuna said, 0 Madhusudana, the system of yoga which you have 
summarized appears impractical and unendurable to me, for the mind is 
restless and unsteady." (Bg. 6.33) 
But the Lord says: 
yogmam api sarve§iim mad-gateniintariitmanii 
sraddhiiviin bhajate yo miim sa me yuk tatamo mat a[!, 
26 
Bhagavad-glta As It Is 
"Of all yogis, he who always abides in Me with great faith, worshiping Me 
in transcendental loving service, is most intimately united with Me in 
yoga, and is the highest of all." (Bg. ().47) So one who thinks of the 
Supreme Lord always is the greatest yog�-� the supermost jiiiin� and the 
greatest devotee at the same time. The Lord further tells Arjuna that as a 
k§atriya he cannot give up his fighting, but if Arj!ma fights remembering 
Kpg1a, then he will be able to remember Him at the time of death. But one 
must be completely surrendered in the transcendental loving service of 
the Lord. 
We work not with our body, actually, but with our mind and intelli­
gence. So if the intelligence and the mind are always engaged in the thought 
of the Supreme Lord, then naturally the senses are also engaged in His 
service. Superficially, at least, the activities of the senses remain the same, 
but the consciousness is changed. The Bhagavad-gitii teaches one how to 
absorb the mind and intelligence in the thought of the Lord. Such absorp­
tion will enable one to transfer himself to the kingdom of the Lord. If 
the mind is engaged in Kr�!ia's service, then the senses are automatically 
engaged in His service. This is the art, and this is also the secret of 
Bhagavad-gitii: total absorption in the thought of Sri Kr�!la. 
Modern man has struggled very hard to reach the moon, but he has not 
tried very hard to. elevate himself spiritually. If one has fifty years of life 
ahead of him, he should engage that brief time in cultivating this practice 
of remembering the Supreme Personality of Godhead. This practice is the 
devotional process of: 
srava(l.am kirtanam vi§(l.o[l smara(l.am piida-sevanam 
arcanam vandanam diisyam sakhyam iitma-nivedanam 
These nine processes, of which the easiest is srava(l.am, hearing Bhagavad­
gitii from the realized person, will turn one to the thought of the Supreme 
Being. This will lead to niscala, remembering the Supreme Lord, and will 
enable one, upon leaving the body, to attain a spiritual body which is just 
fit for association with the Supreme Lord. 
The Lord further says: 
abh yiisa-yoga-yuk tena cetasii niin ya-giiminii 
paramam puru§am divyam yiiti piirthiinucintayan 
"By practicing this remembering, without being deviated, thinking ever of 
the Supreme Godhead, one is sure to achieve the planet of the Divine, the 
Supreme Personality, 0 son of Kunti.'; (Bg. 8.8) 
Introduction 
27 
This is not a very difficult process. However, one must learn it from an 
experienced person, from one who is already in the practice. The mind is 
always flying to this and that, but one must always practice concentrating 
the mind on the form of the Supreme Lord Sri Kr�!la or on the sound of 
His name. The mind is naturally restless, going hither and thither, but it 
can rest in the sound vibration of Kr�!la. One must thus meditate on 
paramam puru§arh, the Supreme Person, and thus attain Him. The ways 
and the means for ultimate realization, ultimate attainment, are stated in 
the Bhagavad-gitii, and the doors of this knowledge are open for everyone. 
No one is barred out. All classes of men can approach the, Lord by thinking 
of Him, for hearing and thinking of Him is possible for everyone. 
The Lord further says: 
miim hi piirtha vyapiisritya ye 'pi syu[l, piipa-yonaya[l, 
striyo vaisyiis tathii sudriis te 'pi yiinti pariim gatim 
kim punar briihmarii[l, puryii bhahtii riijar§ayas tathii 
anityam asuhham lokam imam priipya bhajasva miim 
"0 son of Prtha, anyone who will take shelter in Me, whether a woman, or 
a merchant, or one born in a low family, can yet approach the supreme 
destination. How much greater then are the briihmaras, the righteous, the 
devotees, and saintly kings! In this miserable world, these are fixed in 
' 
devotional service to the Lord." (Bg. 9.32-33) 
Human beings even in the lower statuses of life (a merchant, a woman or 
a laborer) can attain the Supreme. One does not need highly developed 
intelligence. The point is that anyone who accepts the principle of bhakti­
yoga and accepts the Supreme Lord as the summum bonum of life, as 
the highest target, the ultimate goal, can approach the Lord in the spiritual 
sky. If one adopts the principles enunciated in Bhagavad-gita, he can make 
his life perfect and make a perfect solution to all the problems of life 
which arise out of the transient nature of material existence. This is the 
sum and substance of the entire Bhagavad-gitii. 
In conclusion, Bhagavad-gitii is a transcendental literature which one 
should read very carefully. It is capable of saving one from all fear. 
nehiibhikrama-niiso 'sti pratyaviiyo na vidyate 
svalpam apy asya dharmasya triiyate mahato bhayiit 
"In this endeavor there is no loss or diminution, and a little advancement 
on this path can protect one from the most dangerous type of fear." (Bg. 
28 
Bhagavad-glta As It Is 
2.40) If one reads Bhagavad-gitii sincerely and seriously, then all of the 
reactions of his past misdeeds will not react upon him. In the last portion 
of Bhagavad-gitii, Lord Sri Kr��a proclaims: 
saroa-dhanniin parityajya miim ekam sarar-am vraja 
aham tviim saroa-piipebhyo mok§ayi§yiimi mii suca[l 
"Give up all varieties of religiousness, and just surrender unto Me; and in 
return I shall protect you from all sinful reactions. Therefore, you have 
nothing to fear." (Bg. 18.66) Thus the Lord takes all responsibility for 
one who surrenders unto Him, and He indemnifies all the reactions of sin. 
One cleanses himself daily by taking a bath in water, but one who takes 
his bath only once in the sacred Ganges water of the Bhagavad-gitii cleanses 
away all the dirt of material life. Because Bhagavad-gitii is spoken by the 
Supreme Personality of Godhead, one need not read any other Vedic 
literature. One need only attentively and regularly hear and read Bhagavad­
gitii. In the present age, mankind is so absorbed with mundane activities 
that it is not possible to read all of the Vedic literatures. But this is not 
necessary. This one book, Bhagavad-gitii, will suffice because it is the 
essence of all Vedic literatures and because it is spoken by the Supreme 
Personality of Godhead. It is said that one who drinks the water of the 
Ganges certainly gets salvation, but what to speak of one who drinks the 
waters of Bhagavad-gitii? Gitii is the very nectar of theMahiibhiirata spoken 
by Vi�vu Himself, for Lord Kr�va is the original Vi�vu. It is nectar emanat­
ing from the mouth of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and the 
Ganges is said to be emanating from the lotus feet of the Lord. Of course 
there is no difference between the mouth and the feet of the Supreme 
Lord, but in our position we can appreciate that the Bhagavad-gitii is even 
more important than the Ganges. 
The Bhagavad-gitii is just like a cow, and Lord Kr��a, who is a cowherd 
boy, is milking this cow. The milk is the essence of the Vedas, and Arjuna 
is just like a calf. The wise men, the great sages and pure devotees, are to 
drink the nectarean milk of Bhagavad-gitii. 
In this present day, man is very eager to have one scripture, one God, 
one religion, and one occupation. So let there be one common scripture 
for the whole world-Bhagavad-gitii. And let there be one God only for 
the whole world-Sri Kr��a. And one mantra only-Hare Krwa, Hare Kfwa, 
Kr�va Kr�va, Hare Hare/ Hare Rama, Hare Rama, Rama Rama, Hare Hare. 
And let there be one work only-the service of the Supreme Personality 
of Godhead.

TRANSLATION 
Dhrtar�tra said: 0 Sarijaya, after assembling in the place of pilgrimage 
at Kuruk�etra, what did my sons and the sons of Par.uJu do, being desirous 
to fight? 
PURPORT 
Bhagavad-gitii is the widely read theistic science summarized in the 
Gitii-miihiitmya (Glorification of the Gitii). There it says that one should 
read Bhagavad-gitii very scrutinizingly with the help of a person who is a 
devotee of Sri Kf�l).a and try to understand it without personally motivated 
interpretations. 
The example of clear understanding is there in the 
Bhagavad-gitii itself, in the way the teaching is understood by Arjuna, who 
' heard the Gitii directly from the Lord. If someone is fortunate enough 
to' understand Bhagavad-gitii in that line of disciplic succession, without 
motivated interpretation, then he surpasses all studies of Vedic wisdom, 
and all scriptures of the world. One will find in the Bhagavad-gitii all that 
is contained in other scriptures, but the reader will also find things which 
are riot to be found elsewhere. That is the specific standard of the Gitii. 
It is the perfect theistic science because it is directly spoken by the Supreme 
Personality of Godhead, Lord Sri Kr�l).a. 
· 
The topics discussed by Dhftara�tra and Safijaya, as described in the 
Mahiibhiirata, form the basic principle for this great philosophy. It is 
understood that this philosophy evolved on the Battlefield of Kuruk�etra, 
which is a sacred place of pilgrimage from the immemorial time of the 
Vedic age. It was spoken by the Lord when He was present personally on 
this planet for the guidance of mankind. 
The word dharma-k�etra (a place where religious rituals are performed) 
is significant because, on the BattlefiCld of Kuruk�etra, the Supreme 
Personality of Godhead was present on the side of Arjuna. Dhftara�tra, 
the father of the Kurus, was highly doubtful about the possibility of his 
sons' ultimate victory. In his doubt, he inquired from his secretary 
Sarijaya, "What did my sons and the sons of Pav9u do?" He was confident 
that both his sons and the sons of his younger brother Pap.�u we.re 
assembled in that Field .of Kuruk�etra for a determined engagement of the 
war. Still, his inquiry is significant. He did not want a compromise between 
the cousins and brothers, and he wanted to be sure of the fate of his sons 
on the battlefield. Because the battle was arranged to be fought at 
Kuruk�etra, which is mentioned elsewhere in the Vedas as a place of 
'
v
 
Text 2] 
Observing the Armies on the Battlefield of Kum�etra 
33 
worship-even for the 
denizens of heaven-Dhrtara�tra became very 
fearful about the influence of the holy place on the outcome of the battle. 
He knew very well that this would influence Arjuna and the sons of Pli!J.�U 
favorably, because by nature they were all virtuous. Safijaya was a student 
of Vyasa, and therefore, by the mercy of Vyasa, Safijaya was able to 
envision the Battlefield of Kuruk�etra even while he was in the room of 
Dhrtarli§tra. And so, Dhrtarli§tra asked him about the situation on the 
battlefield. 
Both the Pli!J.�avas and the sons of Dhrtarli§tra belong to the same 
family, but Dhftarli§tra's mind is disclosed herein. He deliberately claimed 
only his sons as Kurus, and he separated the sons of Pli!J.�U from the family 
heritage. One can thus understand the specific position of Dhftarli§tra in 
his relationship with his nephews, the sons of Pli!J.�U. As in the paddy 
field the unnecessary plants are taken out, so it is expected from the very · 
beginning of these topics that in the religious field of Kuruk§etra where 
the father of religion, Sri Kf§!J.a, was present, the unwanted plants like 
Dhrtarli§tra's son Duryodhana and others would be wiped out and the 
thoroughly religious persons, headed by Yudhi§thira, would be established 
by the Lord. This is the significance of the words dharma-k§etre and kum­
k§etre, apart from their historical and Vedic importance.

Saiijaya said: 0 King, after looking over the army gathered by the sons 
of Par;uJu, King Duryodhana went to his teacher and began to speak the 
following words: 
PURPORT 
Dhrtara�tra was blind from birth. Unfortunately, he was also bereft of 
spiritual vision. He knew very well that his sons were equally blind in the 
matter of religion, and he was sure that they could never reach an under­
standing with the Pa�u;lavas, who were all pious since birth. Still he was 
doubtful about the influence of the place of pilgrimage, and Saiijaya could 
understand his motive in asking about the situation on the battlefield. He 
wanted, therefore, to encourage the despondent King, and thus he warned 
him that his sons were not going to make any sort of compromise under 
the influence of the holy place. Saiijaya therefore informed the King that 
his son, Duryodhana, after seeing the military force of the Pa�l)avas, at 
once went to the commander-in-chief, Dro�acarya, to inform him of the 
real position. Although Duryodhana is mentioned as the king, he still had 
to go to the commander on account of the seriousness of the situation. He 
was therefore quite fit to be a politician. But Duryodhana's diplomatic 
veneer could not disguise the fear he felt when he saw the military arrange­
ment of the Pa�l)avas.

TRANSLATION 
0 my teacher, behold the great army of the sons of P�c;Iu, so expertly 
arranged by your intelligent disciple, the son of Drupada. 
PURPORT 
Duryodhana, a great diplomat, wanted to point out the defects of 
Dro�;tadirya, the great briihmar-a commander-in-chief. Dro�;tacarya had 
some political quarrel with King Drupada, the father of Draupadi, who was 
Arjuna's wife. As a result of this quarrel, Drupada performed a great 
sacrifice, by which he received the benediction of having a son who would 
be able to kill Dro�;tacarya. Dro�;tacarya knew this perfectly well, and yet, 
as a liberal briihmar-a, he did not hesitate to impart all his military secrets 
when the son of Drupada, Dhr�tadyumna, was entrusted to. him for 
military education. Now, on the Battlefield of Kuruk�etra, Dhr�tadyumna 
took the side of the Pa�c;Iavas, and it was he who arranged for their 
military phalanx, after having learned the art from Dro�;tacarya. Duryo­
dhana pointed out this mistake of Dro�;tacarya 's so that he might be alert 
and uncompromising in the fighting. By this he wanted to point out also 
that he should not be similarly lenient in battle against the Pa�c;Iavas, who 
were also Dro�;tacarya's affectionate students. Arjuna, especially, was his 
most affectionate and brilliant student. Duryodhana also warned that such 
leniency in the fight would lead to defeat.

Here in this army there are many heroic bowmen equal in fighting to

and Drupada. 
PURPORT 
Even though Dhr�tadyumna was not a very important obstacle in the 
face of DroJ).adirya's very great power in the military art, there were many 
others who were the cause of fear. They are mentioned by Duryodhana as 
great stumbling blocks on the path of victory because each and every one 
of them was as formidable as Bhima and Arjuna. He knew the strength of 
Bhima and Arjuna, and thus he compared the others with them.

PURPORT 
As far as the others are concerned-like Jayadratha, Krtavarma, Salya, 
etc.-all are determined to lay down their lives for Duryodhana's sake. In 
other words, it is already concluded that all of them would die in the 
Battle of Kuruk�etra for joining the party of the sinful Duryodhana. 
Duryodhana was, of course, confident of his victory on account of the 
above-mentioned combined strength of his friends.

specifically protected by the most experienced general, Grandfather 
Bhi�ma. On the other hand, the forces of the Pa��avas are limited, being 
protected by a less experienced general, Bhima, who is like a fig in the 
presence of Bhi�ma. Duryodhana was always envious of Bhima because 
he knew perfectly well that if he should die at all, he would only be killed 
by Bhima. But at the same time, he was confident of his victory on account 
of the presence of Bhi�ma, who was a far superior general. His conclusion 
that he would come out of the battle victorious was well ascertained.

PURPORT 
Duryodhana, after praising the prowess of Bhi�ma, further considered 
that others might think that they had been considered less important, so 
in his usual diplomatic way, he tried to adjust the situation in the above 
words. He emphasized that Bhi�madeva was undoubtedly the greatest 
hero, but he was an old man, so everyone must especially think of his 
. protection from all sides. He might become engaged in the fight, and the 
enemy might take advantage of his full engagement on one side. Therefore,

it was important that other heroes would not leave their strategic positions 
and allow the enemy to break the phalanx. Duryodhana clearly felt that 
· the victory of the Kurus depended on the presence of Bhi�madeva. He was 
confident of the full support of Bhi�madeva and Dro�acarya in the battle 
because he well knew that they did not even speak a word when Arjuna's 
wife Draupadi, in her helpless condition, had appealed to them for justice 
while she was being forced to strip naked in the presence of all the great 
generals in the assembly. Although he knew that the two generals had 
some sort of affection for the Piii).Qavas, he hoped that all such affection 
would now be completely given up by them, as was customary during the 
gambling performances.

TRANSLATION 
On the other side, both Lord Kr!JI).a and Arjuna, stationed on a great 
chariot drawn by white horses, sounded their transcendental conchshells. 
PURPORT 
In contrast with the conchshell blown by Bhi�madeva, the conchshells 
in the hands of Kr��a and Arjuna are described as transcendental. The 
sounding of the transcendental conchshells indicated that there was no 
hope of victory for the other side because Kr�I).a was on the side of the 
Pal).t;lavas. ]ayas tu piir{iu-putriirtiirh ye§iim pak§e janiirdana[l,. Victory is 
always with persons like the sons of Pa��u because Lord Kr��a is associ­
ated with them. And whenever and wherever the Lord is present, the 
goddess of fortune is also there because the goddess of fortune never lives 
alone without her husband. Therefore, victory and fortune were awaiting 
Arjuna, as indicated by the transcendental sound produced by the conch­
shell of Vi��u, or Lord Krwa. Besides that, the chariot on which both the 
friends were seated was donated by Agni (the fire-god) to Arjuna, and this 
indicated that this chariot was capable of conquering all sides, wherever it 
was drawn over the three worlds.

TRANSI.ATION 
Then, Lord Kr�J}.a blew His conchshell, called Paiicajanya; Arjuna blew 
his, the Devadatta; and Bhima, the voracious eater and performer of 
Herculean tasks, blew his terrific conchshell called PauJ}.c;lram. 
PURPORT 
Lord Kr�!ia is referred to as Hr�ikesa in this verse because He Is the 
owner of all s.enses. The living entities are part and parcel of Him, and, 
therefore, the senses of the living entities are also part and parcel of His 
senses. The impersonalists cannot account for the senses of the living 
entities, and therefore they are always anxious to describe all living entities 
as sense-less, or impersonal. The Lord, situated in the hearts of all living 
entities, directs their senses. But, He directs in terms of the surrender of 
the living entity, and in the case of a pure devotee He directly controls the 
senses. Here on the Battlefield of Kuruk�etra the Lord directly controls 
the transcendental senses of Arjuna, and thus His particular name of 
Hr�ikesa. The Lord has different names according to His different activities. 
For example, His name is Madhusiidana because He killed the demon of 
the name Madhu; His name is Govinda because He gives pleasure to the 
cows and to the senses; His name is Vasudeva because He appeared as the . 
son of Vasudeva; His name is Devaki-nandana because He accepted Devaki 
as His mother; His name is Yasoda-nandana because He awarded His child­
hood pastimes to Y asoda at Vrndavana; His name is Partha-sarathi because 
He worked as charioteer of His friend Arjuna. Similarly, His name is 
Hr�ikesa because He gave direction to Arjuna on the Battlefield of Kuru­
k�etra. 
Arjuna is referred to as Dhanafijaya in this verse because he helped his 
elder brother in fetching wealth when it was required by the King to make 
expenditures for different sacrifices. Similarly, Bhima is known as V rko­
dara because he could eat as voraciously as he could perform Herculean 
tasks, such as killing the demon Hi�imba. So, the particular types of 
conchshell blown by the different personalities on the side of the Pii!J.�avas, 
beginning with the Lord's, were all very encouraging to the fighting soldiers. 
On the other side there were no such credits, nor the presence of Lord 
!

by the sounds of the conchshells.

their respective conchshells. 
PURPORT 
Saiijaya informed King Dhrtadi.�tra very tactfully that his unwise policy 
of deceiving the sons of Pap�u and endeavoring to enthrone his own sons 
on the seat of the kingdom was not very laudable. The signs already 
clearly indicated that the whole Kuru dynasty would be killed in that 
great battle. Beginning with the grandsire, Bhi�ma, down to the grandsons 
like Abhimanyu and others-including kings from many states of the world 
-all were present there, and all were doomed. Th� whole catastrophe was 
due to King Dhrtara�tra, because he encouraged the policy followed by his 
sons.

The blowing of these different conchshells became uproarious, and thus, 
vibrating both in the sky and on the earth, it shattered the hearts of the 
sons of Dhrtara�tra. 
PURPORT 
When Bhl�ma and the others on the side of Duryodhana blew their 
respective conchshells, there was no heart-breaking on the part of the 
Par;u;lavas. Such occurrences are not mentioned, but in this particular verse 
it is mentioned that the hearts of the sons of Dhrtara��ra were shattered by 
the sounds vibrated by the Pal).gavas' party. This is due to the Pal).<;lavas and 
their confidence in Lord Kr�IJ.a. One who takes shelter of the Supreme 
Lord has nothing to fear, even in the midst of the greatest calamity.

PURPORT 
The battle was just about to begin. It is understood from the above 
statement that the sons of Dhrtara�tra were m_ore or less disheartened by 
the unexpected arrangement of military force by the Pli!J.�avas, who were 
guided by the direct instructions of Lord Kr�!la on the battlefield. The 
emblem of Hanuman on the flag of Arjuna is another sign of victory 
because Hanuman cooperated with Lord Rama in the battle between 
Rli..ma and Rava!J.a, and Lord Ram a emerged victorious. Now both Rama 
and Hanuman were present on the chariot of Arjuna. to help him. Lord 
Krwa is Rama Himself, and wherever Lord Rama is, His eternal servitor 
Hanuman and His eternal consort Sita, the goddess of fortune, are present. 
Therefore, Arjuna had no cause to fear any enemies whatsoever. And above 
all, the Lord of the senses, Lord Kr�!J.a, was personally present to give him 
direction. Thus, all good counsel was available to Arjuna in the.matter of 
executing the battle. In such auspicious conditions, arranged by the Lord 
for His eternal devotee, lay the signs of assured victory.

TRANSLATION 
Arjuna said: 0 infallible one, please draw my chariot between the two 
armies so that I may see who is present here, who is desirous of fighting, 
and with whom I must contend in this great battle attempt. 
PURPORT 
Although Lord K.f�!la is the Supreme Personality of Godhead, out of 
His causeless mercy He was engaged in the service of His friend. He 
never fails in His affection for His devotees, and thus He is addressed 
herein as infallible. As charioteer, He had to carry out the orders of 
Arjuna, and since He did not hesitate to do so, He is addressed as infallible. 
Although He had accepted the position of a charioteer for His devotee, 
His supreme position was not challenged. In all circumstances, He is the Su­
preme Personality of Godhead, Hr�Ikesa, the Lord of the total senses. The 
relationship between the Lord and His servitor is very sweet and transcen-
' 
dental. The servitor is always ready to render a service to the Lord, and, 
similarly, the Lord is always seeking an opportunity to render some service 
to the devotee. He takes greater pleasure in His pure devotee's assuming 
the advantageous position of ordering Him than He does in being the giver 
of orders. As master, everyone is under His orders, and no one is above Him 
to order Him. But when he finds that a pure devotee is ordering _Him, 
He obta,!ns transcendental pleasure, although He is the infallible master of 
all circumstances. 
As a pure devotee of the Lord, Arjuna had no desire to fight with his 
cousins and brothers, but he was forced to come onto the battlefield by 
the obstinacy of Duryodhana, who was never agreeable to any peaceful 
negotiation. Therefore, he was very anxious to see who the leading 
persons present on the battlefield were. Although there was no question 
of a peacemaking endeavor on the battlefield, he wanted to see them again, 
and to see how much they were bent upon demanding an unwanted war.

PURPORT 
It was an open secret that Duryodhana wanted to usurp the kingdom of 
the Pa!!-9-avas by evil plans, in collaboration with his father, Dhrtara�tra. 
Therefore, all persons who had joined the side of Duryodhana must have 
been birds of the same feather. Arjuna wanted to see them in the 
battlefield before the fight was begun, just to learn who they were, but he 
had no intention of proposing peace negotiations with them. It was also a 
fact that he wanted to see them to make an estimate of the strength 
which he had to face, although he was quite confident of victory because 
K.f�!la was sitting by his side.

TRANSLATION 
Saiijaya said: 0 descendant of Bharata, being thus addressed by Arjuna, 
Lord Kr�Qa drew up the fine chariot in the midst of the armies of both 
parties. 
PURPORT 
In this verse Arjuna is referred to as Gu�akesa. Gu{liika means sleep, and 
one who conquers sleep is called gu{liikesa. Sleep also means ignorance. So 
Arjuna conquered both sleep and ignorance because of his friendship with 
Kr��a. As a great devotee of Kr�!J.a, he could not forget Kr�l)a even for a 
moment, because that is the nature of a devotee. Either in waking or in 
sleep, a devotee of the Lord can never he free from thinking of�!la's 
name, form, quality and pastimes. Thus a devotee of Kr��a can conquer. 
both sleep and ignorance simply by thinking of Kr��a constantly. This is 
called Kr�rta consciousness, or samiidhi. As Hr�ikesa, or the director of the. 
senses and mind of every living entity, Kr�l)a could understand Arjuna's 
purpose in placing the chariot in the midst of the armies. Thus He did so, 
and spoke as follows.

In the presence of Bhi�ma, Dror;ta and all other chieftains of the world,

assembled here. 
PURPORT 
As theSupersoulof all living entities, Lord Kr�I,la could understand what 
was going on in the mind of Arjuna. The use of the word Hr�ikesa in this 
connection indicates that He knew everything. And the word Partha, or 
the son of Kunti or Prtha, is also similarly significant in reference to Arjuna. 
· As a friend, He wanted to inform Arjuna that because Arjuna was the son 
of Prtha, the sister of His own father Vasudeva, He had agreed to be the 
charioteer of Arjuna. Now what did Kr�l).a mean when He told Arjuna to 
"behold the Kurus"? Did Arjuna want to stop there and not fight? Kr�l).a 
never expected such things from the son of His aunt Prtha. The mind of 
Arjuna was thus predicated by the Lord in friendly joking.

uncles like Salya and Sakuni, brothers like Duryodhana, sons like Lak�mal)a,

Arjuna said: My dear Kr�J).a, seeing my friends and relatives present

. 
PURPORT 
Any man who has genuine devotion to the Lord has all the good quali­
ties which are found in godly persons or in the demigods, whereas the 
nondevotee, however advanced he may be in material qualifications· by 
education and culture, lacks in godly qualities. As such, Arjuna, just after 
seeing his kinsmen, friends and relatives on the battlefield, was at once 
overwhelmed by compassion for them who had so decided to fight amongst 
themselves. As far as his soldiers were concerned, he was sympathetic from 
the beginning, but he felt compassion even for the soldiers of the opposite 
Text 29 J 
Observing the Armies on the Battlefield of Kuru�etra 
55 
party, foreseeing their imminent death. And so thinking, the limbs of his 
body began to quiver, and his mouth became dry. ·He was more or less 
astonished to see their fighting spirit. Practically the whole community, 
all blood relatives of Arjuna, had come to fight with him. This over-. 
whelmed a kind devotee like Arjuna. Although it is not mentioned here, 
still one can easily imagine that not only were Arjuna 's bodily limbs 
quivering and his mouth drying up, but that he was also crying out of 
compassion. Such symptoms in Arjuna were not due to weakness but to 
his softheartedness, a characteristic of a pure devotee of the Lord. It is said 
therefore:

PURPORT 
There are two kinds of trembling of the body, and two kinds of stand-
. ings of the hair on end. Such phenomena occur either in great spiritual 
ecstasy or out of great fear under material conditions. There is no fear in 
transcendental realization. Arjuna 's symptoms in this situation are out of 
material fear-namely, loss of life. This is evident from other symptoms 
also; he became so impatient that his famous bow Ga!l9iva was slipping 
from his hands, and, because his heart was burning within him, he was 
feeling a burning sensation of the skin. All these are due to a material 
conception of life.

Due to his impatience, Arjuna was unable to stay on the battlefield, and 
he was forgetting himself on account of the weakness of his mind. Ex­
cessive attachment for material things puts a man in a bewildering condi­
tion of existence. Bhayarh dvitiyiibhinivesata[l: such fearfulness and loss 
of mental equilibrium take place in persons who are too affected by

material conditions. Arjuna envisioned only unhappiness in the battle­
field-he would not be happy even by gaining victory over the foe. The 
word nimitta is significant. When a man sees only frustration in his ex­
pectations, he thinks, "Why am I here?" Everyone is interested in himself 
and his own welfare. No one is interested in the Supreme Self. Arjuna is 
supposed to show disregard for self-interest by submission to the will of 
Kr�!J.a, who is everyone's real self-interest. The conditioned soul forgets 
this, and therefore suffers material pains. Arjuna thought that his victory 
in the battle would only be a cause of lamentation for him.

I do not see how any good can come from killing my own kinsmen in

PURPORT 
Without knowing that one's self-interest is in Vi�!J.U (or Kr�!la ), condi­
tioned souls are attracted by bodily relationships, hoping to be happy in 
such situations. Under delusion, they forget that Kr�!la is also the cause 
of material happiness. Arjuna appears to have even forgotten the moral 
, 
codes for a k§atriya. It is said that two kinds of men, namely the k§atriya 
who dies directly in front of the battlefield under Kr�!la 's personal orders 
58 
Bhagavad-g1ta As It Is 
[Ch,l 
and the person in the renounced order of life who is absolutely devoted to 
spiritual culture, are eligible to enter into the sun-globe, which is so power­
ful and dazzling. Arjuna is reluctant even to kill his enemies, let alone his 
relatives. He thought that by killing his kinsmen there would be no happi­
ness in his life, and therefore he was not willing to fight, just as a person 
who does not feel hunger is not inclined to cook. He has now decided to 
go into the forest and live a secluded life in frustration. But as a k§atriya, 
he requires a kingdom for his subsistence, because the k§atriyas cannot 
engage themselves in any other occupation. But Arjuna has had no king­
dom. Arjuna's sole opportunity for gaining a kingdom lay in fighting with 
his cousins and brothers and reclaiming the kingdom inherited from his 
father, which he does not like to do. Therefore he considers himself fit 
to go to the forest to live a secluded life of frustration.

TRANSLATION 
0 Govinda, of what avail to us are kingdoms, happiness or even life 
itself when all those for whom we may desire them are now arrayed in 
this battlefield? 0 Madhusudana, when teachers, fathers, sons, grand­
fathers, maternal uncles, fathers-in-law, grandsons, brothers-in-law and all 
relatives are ready to give up their lives and properties and are standing 
before me, then why should I wish to kill them, though I may survive? 0 
maintainer of all creatures, I am not prepared to fight with them even in 
exchange for the three worlds, let alone this earth. 
PURPORT 
Arjuna has addressed Lord Kr�!la as Govinda because Kr�!la is the object 
of all pleasures for cows and the senses. By using this significant word, 
Arjuna indicates what will satisfy his senses. Although Govinda is not 
meant for satisfying our senses, if we try to satisfy the senses of Govinda 
then automatically our own senses are satisfied. Materially, everyone wants 
to satisfy his senses, and he wants God to be the order supplier for such 
I' 
60 
Bhagavad-gita As It Is 
[Ch. 1 
satisfaction. The Lord will satisfy the senses of the living entities as much 
as they deserve, but not to the extent that they may covet. But when one 
takes the opposite way -namely, when one tries to satisfy the senses of 
Govinda without desiring to satisfy one's own senses-then by the grace of 
Govinda all desires of the living entity are satisfied. Arjuna 's deep affection 
for community and family members is exhibited here partly due to his 
natural compassion for them. He is therefore not prepared to fight. 
Everyone wants to show his opulence to friends and relatives, but Arjuna 
fears that all his relatives and friends will be killed in the battlefield, and 
he will be unable to share his opulence after victory. This is a typical 
calculation of material life. The transcendental life is, however, different. 
Since a devotee wants to satisfy the desires of the Lord, he can, Lord 
willing, accept 
'
an kinds of opulence for the service of the Lord, and if the 
Lord is not willing, he should not accept a farthing. Arjuna did not want 
to kill his relatives, and if there were any need to kill them, he desired that 
Kr�!la kill them personally. At this point he did not know that Kr�!la had 
already killed them before their coming into the battlefield and that he 
was only to become an instrument for Kr�J)a. This fact is disclosed in 
following chapters. As a natural devotee of the Lord, Arjuna did not like 
to retaliate against his miscreant cousins and brothers, but it was the Lord's 
plan that they should all be killed. The devotee of the Lord does not 
retaliate against the wrongdoer, but the Lord does not tolerate any mischief 
done to the devotee by the miscreants. The Lord can excuse a person on 
His own account, but He excuses no one who has done harm to His 
devotees. Therefore the Lord was determined to kill the miscreants, al­
though Arjuna wanted to excuse them.

TRANSLATION 
Sin will overcome us if we slay such aggressors. Therefore it is not 
proper for us to kill the sons of Dhrtara�tra and our friends. What should 
we gain, 0 Kr�r;ta, husband of the goddess of fortune, and how could we 
be happy by killing our own kinsmen? 
PURPORT 
According to Vedic injunctions there are six kinds of aggressors: I) a 
poison giver, 2) one who sets fire to the house, 3) one who attacks with 
deadly weapons, 4) one who plunders riches, 5) one who occupies another's 
land, and 6) one who kidnaps a wife. Such aggressors are at once to be 
killed, and no sin is incurred by killing such aggressors. Such killing of 
aggressors is quite befitting for any ordinary man, but Arjuna was not an 
ordinary person. He was saintly by character, and therefore he wanted to 
deal with them in saintliness. This kind of saintliness, however, is not for a 
k�atriya. Although a responsible man in the administration of a state is re­
quired to be saintly, he should not be cowardly. For example, Lord Rama 
was so saintly that people were anxious to live in His kingdom (Riima-riijya), 
but Lord Rama never showed any cowardice. Rava!J.a was an aggressor 
against Rama because he kidnapped Rama's wife, Sita, but Lord Rama gave 
him sufficient lessons, unparalleled in the history of the world. In Arjuna'� 
case, however, one should consider the special type of aggressors, namely 
his own grandfather, own teacher, friends, sons, grandsons, etc. Because of 
them, Arjuna thought that he should not take the severe steps necessary 
against ordinary aggressors. Besides that, saintly persons are advised to 
forgive. Such injunctions for saintly persons are more important than any 
political emergency. Arjuna considered that rather than kill his own kins­
men for political reasons, it would be better to forgive them on grounds of 
religion and saintly behavior. He did not, therefore, consider such killing 
profitable simply for the matter of temporary bodily happiness. After all, 
kingdoms and pleasures derived therefrom are not permanent, so why 
-" 
62 
Bhagavad-gita As It Is 
[Ch. l 
should he risk his life and eternal salvation by killing his own. kinsmen? 
Arjuna's addressing of Kr§pa as "Madhava," or the husband of the goddess 
of fortune, is also significant in this connection. He wanted to point out to 
Krwa that, as husband of the goddess of fortune, He should not have to 
induce Aijuna to take up a matter which would ultimately bring about 
misfortune. Kr�l)a, however, never brings misfortune to anyone, to say 
nothing of His devotees.

PURPORT 
A k§atriya is not supposed to refuse to battle or gamble when he is so 
invited by some rival party. Under such obligation, A� una could not refuse 
to fight because he was challenged by the party of Duryodhana. In this 
connection, Arjuna considered that the .other party might be blind to the 
effects of such a challenge. Arjuna, however, could see the evil conse­
quences and could not accept the challenge. Obligation is actually binding 
when the effect is good, but when the effect is otherwise, then no one can 
be bound. Considering all these pros and cons, Arjuna decided not to fight.

With the destruction of dynasty, the eternal family tradition is van­

practice. 
PURPORT 
In the system of the va'!liisrama institution there are many principles of 
religious traditions to help members of the family grow properly and attain 
spiritual values. The elder members are responsible for such purifying 
processes in the family, beginning from birth to death. But on the death 
of the elder members, such family traditions of purification may stop, and 
the remaining younger family members may develop irreligious habits and 
thereby lose their chance for spiritual salvation. Therefore, for no purpose 
should the elder members of the family be slain.

TRANSLATION 
When irreligion is prominent in the family, 0 Kr�J;ta, the women of the 
family become corrupt, and from the degradation of womanhood, 0 
descendant of Vr�J;ti, comes unwanted progeny. 
PURPORT 
Good population in human society is the basic principle for peace, 
prosperity and spiritual progress in life. The varr-iisrama religion's principles 
were so designed that the good population would prevail in society for 
the general spiritual progress of state and community. Such population 
depends on the chastity and faithfulness of its womanhood. As children 
are very prone to be misled, women are similarly very prone to degradation. 
Therefore, both children and women require protection by the elder 
members of the family. By being engaged in various religious practices, 
women will not be misled into adultery. According to Cii!lakya PaJ;tQ.it, 
women are generally not very intelligent and therefore not trustworthy. 
So, the different family traditions of religious activities should always 
engage them, and thus their chastity and devotion,will give birth to a good 
population eligible for participating in the varriismma system. On the 
failure of such varr-iisrama-dharma, naturally the women become free to 
act and mix with men, and thus adultery is indulged in at the risk of 
unwanted population. Irresponsible men also provoke adultery in society, 
and thus unwanted children flood the human race at the risk of war and 
pestilence.

TRANSLATION 
When there is increase of unwanted population, a hellish situation is 
created both for the family and for those who destroy the family tradition. 
In such corrupt families, there is no offering of oblations of food and 
water to the ancestors. 
PURPORT 
According to the rules and regulations of fruitive activities, there is a 
need to offer periodical food and water to the forefathers of the family. 
This offering is performed by worship of V�!J.U, because eating the 
remnants of food offered to Vi�!J.U can deliver one from all kinds of sinful 
actions. Sometimes the forefathers may be suffering from various types 
of sinful reactions, and sometimes some of them cannot even acquire a 
gross material body and are forced to remain in subtle bodies as ghosts. 
Thus, when remnants of prasiidam. food are offered to forefathers by 
descendants, the forefathers are released from ghostly or other kinds of 
miserable life. Such help rendered to forefathers is a family tradition, and 
those who are not in devotional life are required to perform such rituals. 
One who is engaged in the devotional life is not required to perform such 
actions. Simply by performing devotional service, one can deliver hundreds ·

and thousands of forefathers from all kinds of misery. It is stated in the

(Bhiig.ll.5.41) Such obligations are automatically fulfilled by perform­
ance of devotional service to the Supreme Personality of Godhead.

PURPORT 
Arjuna bases his argument not on his own personal experience, but on 
what he has heard from the authorities. That is the way of receiving real 
knowledge. One cannot reach the real point of factual knowledge without 
being helped by the right person who is already established in that 
knowledge. There is a system in the vaT'{liisrama institution by which one 
has to undergo the process of ablution before death for his sinful activities. 
One who is always engaged in sinful activities must utilize the process of 
ablution called the priiyascitta. Without doing so, one surely will be 
transferred to hellish planets to undergo miserable lives as the result of 
sinful activities.

Alas, how strange it is that we are preparing to commit greatly sinful 
acts, driven by the desire to enjoy royal happiness. 
PURPORT 
Driven by selfish motives, one may be inclined to such sinful acts as the 
killing of one's own brother, father, or mother. There are many such 
instances in the history of the world. But Arjuna, being a saintly devotee 
of the Lord, is always conscious of moral principles and therefore takes 
care to avoid such activities.

I would consider it better for the sons of Dhrtara�tra to kill me unarmed 
and unresisting, rather than fight with them. 
PURPORT 
It is the custom-according to k§atriya fighting principles-that an un­
armed and unwilling foe should not be attacked. Arjuna, however, in such 
an enigmatic position, decided he would not fight if he were attacked by 
the enemy. He did not consider how much the other party was bent upon 
fighting. All these symptoms are due to softheartedness resulting from his 
being a great devotee of the Lord.

Safijaya said: Arjuna, having thus spoken on the battlefield, cast aside 
his bow. and arrows and sat down on the chariot, his mind overwhelmed 
with grief. 
PURPORT 
While observing the situation of his enemy, A�una .stood up on the 
. chariot, but he was so afflicted with lamentation that he sat down again, 
setting aside his bow and arrows. Such a kind and softhearted person, ih 
the devotional service of the Lord, is fit to receive self-knowledge. 
Thus end the Bhaktivedanta Purports to the First Chapter of the 
$rimad-Bhagavad-gita in the matter of Observing the Armies on the 
Battlefield of Kuruk§etra.

[Ch. 2 
TRANSLATION 
Sarijaya said: Seeing Arjuna full of compassion and very sorrowful, his 
eyes brimming with tears, Madhusudana, KnlQ.a, spoke the following words. 
PURPORT 
Material compassion, lamentation and tears are all signs of ignorance of 
the real self. Compassion for the eternal soul is self-realization. The word 
".Madhusudana" is significant in this verse. Lord Kr�Q.a killed the demon 
Madhu, and now Arjuna wanted Kr�IJ.a to kill the demon of misunder­
standing that had overtaken him in the discharge of his duty. No one 
knows where compassion should be applied. Compassion for the dress of 
a drowning man is senseless. A man fallen in the ocean of nescience cannot 
be saved simply by rescuing his outward dress-the gross material body. 
One who does not know this and laments for the outward dress is called a 
siidra, or one who laments unnecessarily. Arjuna was a k§atriya, and this 
conduct was not expected from him. Lord Kr�IJ.a, however, can dissipate 
the lamentation of the ignorant man, and for this purpose the Bhagavad­
gitii was sung by Him. This chapter instructs us in self-realization by an 
analytical study of the material body and the spirit soul, as explained by 
the supreme authority, Lord Sri Kr�JJ.a. This realization is made possible 
by working with the fruitive being situated in the fixed conception of the 
real self.

TRANSLATION 
The Supreme Person [Bhagavan] said: My dear Arjuna, how have these 
impurities come upon you? They are not at all befitting a man who knows 
the progressive values of life. They do not lead to higher planets, ·but to 
infamy. 
PURPORT 
Kr�J;�a and the Supreme Personality of Godhead are identical. Therefore 
Lord Kr�J;�a is referred to as "Bhagavan" throughout the Gitii. Bhagavan is 
the ·ultimate in the Absolute Truth. Absolute Truth is realized in three 
phases of understanding, namely Brahman or the impersonal all-pervasive 
spirit; Paramatma, or the localized aspect of the Supreme within the heart 
of all living entities; and Bhagavan, or the Supreme Personality of Godhead, 
Lord Kr�J;�a. In the Srimad-Bhiigavatam this conception of the Absolute 
Truth is explained thus: 
vadanti tat tattva-vidas tattvarh yaj jiiiinam advayam 
brahmeti paramiitmeti bhagaviin iti sabdyate. 
"The Absolute Truth is realized in three phases of understanding by the 
knower of the Absolute Truth, and all of them are identical. Such phases 
of the 
Absolute Truth are expressed as Brahman, Paramatma, and 
Bhagavan." (Bh(ig. 1.2.11) These three divine aspects can be explained by 
the example of the sun, which also has three different aspects, namely the 
sunshine, the sun's surface and the sun planet itself. One who studies the 
sunshine only is the preliminary student. One who understands the sun's . 
surface is further advanced. And one who can enter into the sun planet is 
the highest. Ordinary students who are satisfied by simply understanding 
the sunshine-its universal pervasiveness and the glaring effulgence of its 
impersonal nature-may be compared to those who can realize only the 
Brahman feature of the Absolute Truth. The student who has advanced 
still further can know the sun disc, which is compared to knowledge of the 
Paramatma feature of the Absolute Truth. And the student who can enter 
74 
Bhagavad-gita As It Is 
[Ch. 2 
into the heart of the sun planet is compared to those who realize the 
personal features of the Supreme Absolute Truth. Therefore, the bhaktas, 
or the transcendentalists who have realized the Bhagavan feature of the 
Absolute Truth, are the topmost transcendentalists, although all students 
who are engaged in the study of the Absolute Truth are engaged in the 
same subject matter. The sunshine, the sun disc and the inner affairs of the 
sun planet cannot be separated from one another, and yet the students of 
the three different phases are not in the same category. 
The Sanskrit word Bhagaviin is explained by the great authority, 
Parasara Muni, the father of Vyasadeva. The Supreme Personality who 
possesses all riches, all strength, all fame, all beauty, all knowledge and all 
renunciation is called Bhagavan. There are many persons who are very rich, 
very powerful, very beautiful, very famous, very learned, and very much 
detached, but no one can claim that he possesses all riches, all strength, 
etc., entirely. Only Kr�IJ.a can claim this because He is the Supreme Per­
sonality of Godhead. No living entity, including Brahma, Lord Siva, or 
Naraya!J.a, can possess opulences as fully as Kr�IJ.a. Therefore it is concluded 
in the Brahma-samhitii by Lord Brahma himself that Lord Kr�IJ.a is the 
Supreme Personality of Godhead. No one is equal to or above Him. He is 
the primeval Lord, or Bhagavan, known as Govinda, and He is the supreme 
cause of all causes. 
i5vara� parama� krrra� sac-cid-iinanda-vigraha� 
aniidir iidir govinda� sarva-kiirara-kiiraram 
"There are many personalities possessing the qualities of Bhagavan, but 
Kr�IJ.a is the supreme because none can excel Him. He is the Supreme 
Person, and His body is eternal, full of knowledge and bliss. He is the 
primeval Lord Govinda and the cause of all causes." (Brahma-samhitii 5.1) 
In the Bhiigavatam also there is a list of many incarnations of the 
Supreme Personality of Godhead, but Kr�pa is described as the original 
Personality of Godhead, from whom many, many incarnations and 
Personalities of Godhead expand: 
ete ciimsa-kalii� pumsa� kr§ras tu bhagaviin svayam 
indriiri-vyiikulam lokam mr!iayanti yuge yuge 
"All the lists of the incarnations of Godhead submitted herewith are either 
plenary expansions or parts of the plenary expansions of the Supreme 
Godhead, but Kr�IJ.a is the Supreme Personality of Godhead Himself."

Therefore, Kr�!la is the original Supreme Personality of Godhead, the 
Absolute Truth, the source of both the Supersoul and the impersonal 
Brahman. 
In the presence of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Arjuna's lamen­
tation for his kinsmen is certainly unbecoming, and therefore Krwa 
expr,essed His surprise with the word kutas, "wherefrom." Such unmanly 
sentiments were never expected from a peroon belonging to the civilized 
class of men known as Aryans. The word iiryan is applicable to persons 
who know the value of life and have a civilization based on spiritual 
realization. Persons who are led by the mater1al conception of life do not 
know that the aim of life is realization of the Absolute Truth, Vi�!J.\1, or 
Bhagavan, and they are captivated by the external features of the material 
world, and therefore they do not know what liberation is. Persons who 
have no knowledge of liberation from material bondage are called nG:1-
Aryans. Although Arjuna was a k§atriya, he was deviating from his 
prescribed duties by declining to fight. This act of cowardice is described 
as befitting the non-Aryans. Such deviation from duty does not help one 
in the progress of spiritual life, nor does it even give one the opportunity 
to become famous in this world. Lord Kr��a did not approve of the so­
called compassion of Arjuna for his kinsmen.

PURPORT 
Arjuna was addressed as the "son of Prtha," who happened to be the 
sister of Kr�':la's father Vasudeva. Therefore Arjuna had a blood relation­
ship with Kr�':la. If the son of a k�atriya declines to fight, he is a k�atriya 
in name only, and if the son of a briihmara acts impiously, he is a 
briihmara in name only. Such k�atriyas and briihmaras are unworthy sons 
of their fathers; therefore, Kr�':la did not want Arjuna to become an 
unworthy son of a k�atriya. Arjuna was the most intimate friend of Kr�':la, 
and Kr�J)a was directly guiding him on the chariot; but in spite of all these 
credits, if Arjuna abandoned the battle, he would be committing an 
infamous act; therefore Kr�':la said that such an attitude in Arjuna did not 
fit his personality. Arjuna might argue that he would give up the battle on 
the grounds of his magnanimous attitude for the most respectable Bhi�ma 
and his relatives, but Krwa considered that sort of magnanimity not 
approved by authority. Therefore, such magnanimity or so-called non­
violence should be given up by persons like Arjuna under the direct 
guidance of Kr�':la.

PURPORT 
Respectable superiors like Bhi�ma the grandfather and Dro�acli.rya the 
teacher are always worshipable. Even if they attack, they should not be 
counterattacked. It is general etiquette that superiors are not to be offered 
even a verbal fight. Even if they are sometimes harsh in behavior, they 
should not be harshly treated. Then, how is it possible for Arjuna to 
counterattack them? Would Kr�IJ.a ever attack His own grandfather, Ugra­
sena, or His teacher, Sandipani Muni? These were some of the arguments 
by Arjuna to Kr��a.

PURPORT 
According to scriptural codes, a teacher who engages in an abominable 
action and has lost his sense of discrimination is fit to be abandoned. 
Bhisma and DroQ.a were obliged to take the side of Duryodhana because 
of his financial assistance, although they should not have accepted such a 
position simply on financial considerations. Under the circumstances, they 
have lost the respectability of teachers. But Arjuna thinks that nevertheless 
they remain his superiors, and therefore to enjoy material profits after 
killing them would mean to enjoy spoils tainted with blood.

TRANSLATION 
Nor do we know which is better-conquering them or being conquered 
by them. The sons of Dhrtara�tra, whom if we killed we should not care 
to live, are now standing before us on this battlefield. 
PURPORT 
Arjuna did not know whether he should fight and risk unnecessary 
violence, although fighting is the duty of the k§atriyas, or whether he 
should refrain and live by begging. If he did not conquer the enemy, 
begging would be his only means of subsistence. Nor was there certain­
ty of victory, because either side might emerge victorious. Even if victory 
awaited them (and their cause was justified), 
still, if the 
sons of 
Text 7) 
Contents of the Glta Summarized 
79 
Dhrtara�tra died in battle, it would be very difficult to live in their absence. 
Under the circumstances, that would be another kind of defeat for them. 
All these considerations by Arjuna definitely prove that he was not only a 
great devotee of the Lord but that he was also highly enlightened and had 
complete control over his mind and senses. His desire to live by begging, 
although he was born in the royal household, is another sign of detach­
ment. He was truly virtuous, as these qualities, combined with his faith in 
the words of instruction of Sri Kr��a (his spiritual master), indicate. It is 
concluded that Arjuna was quite fit for liberation. Unless the senses are 
controlled, there is no chance of elevation to the platform of knowledge, 
and without knowledge and devotion there is no chance of liberation. 
Arjuna was competent in all thes� attributes, over and above his enormous 
attributes in his material relationships.

Bhagavad-gita As It Is 
[Ch. 2 
PURPORT 
By nature's own way the complete system of material activities is a 
source of perplexity for everyone. In every step there is perplexity, and 
therefore it behooves one to approach a bona fide spiritual master who can 
give one proper guidance for executing the purpose of life. All Vedic 
literatures advise us to approach a bona fide spiritual master to get free 
from the perplexities of life which happen without our desire. They are 
like a forest fire that somehow blazes without being set by anyone. 
Similarly, the world situation is such that perplexities of life automatically 
appear, without our wanting such confusion. No one wants fire, and yet 
it takes place, and we become perplexed. The Vedic wisdom therefore 
advises that in order to solve the perplexities of life and to understand the 
science of the solution, one must approach a spiritual master who is in 
the disciplic succession. A person with a bona fide spiritual master is 
supposed to know everything. One should not, therefore, remain in 
material perplexities but should approach a spiritual master. This is the 
purport of this verse. 
Who is the man in material perplexities? It is he who does not under­
stand the problems of life: In the Garga Upaniflad the perplexed man is 
described as follows: 
yo vii etad ak§ararh giirgy aviditviismiillokiit praiti sa krparaft 
"He is a miserly man who does not solve the problems of life as a human 
j_ 
and who thus quits this world like the cats and dogs, without understanding 
the science of self-realization." This human form of life is a most valuable 
asset for the living entity who can ultilize it for solving the problems of 
life; therefore, one who does not utilize this opportunity properly is a 
miser. On the other hand, there is the briihmara, or he who is intelligent 
enough to utilize this body to solve all the problems of life. 
The krpar-as, or miserly persons, waste their time in being overly 
affectionate for family, society, country, etc., in the material conception 
of life. One is often attached to family life, namely to wife, children and 
other members, on the basis of "skin disease." The lqpar-a thinks that he 
is able to protect his family members from death; or the krpar-a thinks 
that his family or society can save him from the verge of death. Such 
family attachment can be found even in the lower animals who take care 
of children also. Being ·intelligent, A�una. could understand that his 
affection for family members and his wish to protect tliem from death 
were the causes of his perplexities. Although he could understand that 
his duty to fight was awaiting him, still, on account of miserly weakness, 
'' 1 �l 
r 
Text 8) 
Contents of the Gita Summarized 
81 
he could not discharge the duties. He is therefore asking Lord Kr�pa, the 
supreme spiritual master, to make a definite solution. He offers himself to 
Krwa as a disciple. He wants to stop friendly talks. Talks between the 
master and the disciple are serious, and now Arjuna wants to talk very 
seriously before the recognized spiritual master. Kr�pa is therefore the 
original spiritual master of the science of Bhagavad-gitii, and Arjuna is the 
first disciple for understanding the Gitii. How Arjuna understands the 
Bhagavad-gitii is stated in the Gitii itself. And yet foolish mundane scholars 
explain that one need not submit to Kr�pa as a person, but to "the unborn 
within Kr�pa." There is no difference between Kr�pa's within and without. 
And one who has no sense of this understanding is the greatest fool in 
trying to understand Bhagavad-gitii.

I can find no means to drive away this grief which is drying up my

PURPORT 
Although Arjuna was putting forward so many arguments based on 
knowledge of the principles of religion and moral codes, it appears that 
82 
. Bhagavad-glta As It Is 
[Ch. 2. 
he was unable to solve his real problem without the help of the spiritual 
master, Lord Sri Kr�!J.a. He could understand that his so-called knowledge 
was useless in driving away his problems, which were drying up his whole 
existence; and it was impossible for him to solve such perplexities without 
the help of a spiritual master like Lord Kr�!J.a. Academic knowledge, 
scholarship, high position, etc., are all useless in solving the problems of 
life; help can only be given by a spiritual master like Kr�I;ta. Therefore, the 
conclusion, is that a spiritual master who is one hundred percent Kr�I;ta 
conscious is the bona fide spiritual master, for he can solve the problems 
of life. Lord Caitanya said that one who is master in the science of Kr�!la 
consciousness, regardless of his social position, is the real spiritual master.

yei krHw-tattva-vetta, sei 'gum' haya. 
( Caitan ya-caritamrta, Madhya 8 .12 7) 
"It does not matter whether a person is a vipra [learned scholar in Vedic 
wisdom] or is born in a lower family, or is in the renounced order of life­
if he is master in the science of Kr�!J.a, he is the perfect and bona fide 
spuitual master." So without being a master in the science of Kr�!la 
consciousness, no one is a bona fide spiritual master. It is also said in 
Vedic literatures: 
flU.t-karma-nipurzo vipro mantra-tantra-visaradafl 
avai�rzavo gumr na syad vai�rzavafl svapaco gumfl 
"A scholarly briihmarza, expert in all subjects of Vedic knowledge, is unfit 
to become a spiritual master without being a V ai�I;tava, or expert in the 
science of Kr�I;ta consciousness. But a person born in a family of a lower 
caste can become a spiritual master if he is a V ai�I;tava, or Kr�I;ta conscious." 
The problems of material existence-birth, old age, disease and death­
cannot be counteracted by accumulation of wealth and economic develop­
ment. In many parts of the world there are states which are replete with 
all facilities of life, which are full of wealth, and economically developed, 
yet the problems of material existence are still present. They are seeking 
peace in different ways, but they can achieve real happiness only if they 
consult Kr�!J.a, or the Bhagavad-gita and Srimad-Bhiigavatam-which con­
stitute the science of Kr�!J.a-or the bona fide representative of Kr�!J.a, the 
man in Kr�!la consciousness.

lamentations for family, social, national or international inebrieties, then 
Arjuna would not have said that even an unrivalled kingdom on earth or. 
supremacy like that of the demigods in the heavenly planets would not be 
able to drive away his lamentations. He sought, therefore, refuge in Kr§pa 
consciousness, and that is the right path for peace and harmony. Economic 
development or supremacy over the world can be finished at any moment 
by the cataclysms of material nature. Even elevation into a higher planetary 
situation, as men are now seeking a place on the moori planet, can also be 
finished at one stroke. The Bhagavad-gitii. confirms this: k§irw pur.ye 
martyalokarit visanti. "When the results of pious activities are finished, 
one falls down again from the peak of happiness to the lowest status of 
life." Many politicians of the world have fallen down in that way. Such 
downfalls only constitute more causes for lamentation. 
Therefore, if we want to curb lamentation for good, then we have to 
take shelter of Kr§pa, as Arjuna is seeking to do. So Arjuna asked Kr§pa 
to solve his problem definitely, and that is the way of Kr§pa consciousness.

PURPORT 
Dhrtara�!ra must have been very glad to understand that Arjuna was not 
going to fight and was instead leaving the battlefield for the begging pro­
fession. But Safijaya disappointed him again in relating that Arjuna was 
competent to kill his enemies (parantapalt). Although Arjuna was for the 
time being overwhelmed with false grief due to family affection, he sur­
rendered unto Kr�J).a, the supreme spiritual master, as a disciple. This indi­
cated that he would soon be free from the false lamentation resulting from 
family affection and would be enlightened with perfect knowledge of 
self-realization, or Kr�r;ta consciousness, and would then surely fight. Thus 
Dhrtara�tra's joy would be frustrated, since Arjuna would be enlightened. 
by Kr�r;ta and would fight to the end.

one of them voluntarily became a student of the other. Kr�tta was smiling 
because a friend had chosen to become a disciple. AB Lord of all, He is 
always in the superior position as the master of everyone, and yet the 
Lord accepts one who wishes to be a friend, a son, a lover or a devotee, or 
who wants Him in such a role. But when He was accepted as the master, He 
at once assumed the role and talked with the disciple like the master­
with gravity, as it is required. It appears that the talk between the master 
and the disciple was openly exchanged in the presence of both armies so 
that all were benefitted. So the talks of Bhagavad-gitii are not for any par­
ticular person, society, or community, but they are for all, and friends or 
enemies,are equally entitled to hear them.

The Lord at once took the position of the teacher and chastised the 
student, calling him, indirectly, a fool. The Lord said, you are talking like 
86 
Bhagavad-glta As It Is 
[Ch. 2 
a learned man, but you do not know that one who is learned-one who 
knows what is body and what is soul-does not lament for any stage of 
the body, neither in the living nor in the dead condition. As it will be ex­
plained in later chapters, it will be clear that knowledge means to know 
matter and spirit and the controller of both. A�una argued that religious 
principles should be given more importance than politics or sociology, but 
he did not know that knowledge of matter, soul and the Supreme is even 
more important than religious formularies. And, because he was lacking in 
that knowledge, he should not have posed himself as a very learned man. 
As he did not happen to be a very learned man, he was consequently 
lamenting for something which was unworthy of lamentation. The body is 
born and is destined to be vanquished today or tomorrow; therefore the 
body is not as important as the soul. One who knows this is actually 
learned, and for him there is no cause for lamentation, regardless of the 
condition of the material body.

of innumerable living entities, in terms of their different situations accord­
ing to individual work and reaction of work_ That Supreme Personality of 
Godhead is also, by His plenary portions, alive in the heart of every living 
entity. Only saintly persons who can see, within and without, the same 
Supreme Lord, can actually attain to perfect and eternal peace. 
nityo nityanarh cetanas cetananam 
eko bahunarh yo vidadhati kaJ?tan 
tam atmastharh ye'nupasyanti dhiras 
te�arh santi[t sasvati netare�am. 
(Katha 2.2.13) 
The same Vedic truth given to Arjuna is given to all persons in the 
world who pose themselves as very learned but factually have but a poor 
fund of knowledge. The Lord says clearly that He Himself, Arjuna, and all 
the kings who are assembled on the battlefield, are eternally individual 
beings and that the Lord .is eternally the maintainer of the individual 
living entities both in their conditioned as well as in their liberated situa­
tions. The Supreme Personality of Godhead is the supreme individual 
person, and Arjuna, the Lord's eternal associate, and all the kings assembled 
there are individual, eternal persons. It is not that they did not exist as 
individuals in the past, and it is not that they will not remain eternal 
persons. Their individuality existed in the past, and their individuality will 
continue in the future without interruption. Therefore, there is no cause 
for lamentation for anyone. 
The Mayavadi theory that after liberation the individual soul, separated 
by the covering of maya or illusion, will merge into the impersonal 
Brahman and lose its individual existence is not supported herein by Lord 
Kr�l).a, the supreme authority. Nor is the theory that we only think of 
individuality in the conditioned state supported herein. Kr�!la clearly says 
herein that in the future also the individuality of the Lord and others, as it 
is confirmed in the Upani§ads, will continue eternally. This statement of 
Krwa is authoritative because Kr�!la cannot be subject to illusion. If 
individuality is not a fact, then Krwa would not have stressed it so much 
-even for the future. The Mayavadi may argue that the individuality 
spoken of by Kr�!la is not spiritual, but material. Even accepting the 
argument that the individuality is material, then how can one distinguish 
Kr�!!a's individuality? Kr�!la affirms His individuality in the past and 
confirms His individuality in the future also. He has confirmed His 
individuality in many ways, and impersonal Brahman has been declared 
to be subordinate to Him. Kr�!la has maintained spiritual individuality

Bhagavad-gita As It Is 
[Ch. 2 
all along; if He is accepted as an ordinary conditioned soul in individual 
consciousness, then His Bhagavad-gitii has no value as authoritative scrip­
ture. A common man with all the four defects of human frailty is unable 
to teach that which is worth hearing. The Gitii is above such literature. No 
mundane book compares with the Bhagavad-gitii. When one accepts Kr�J)a 
as an ordinary man, the Gitii loses all importance. The Mayavadi: argues 
that the plurality mentioned in this verse is conventional and that it refers 
to the body. But previous to this verse such a bodily conception is already 
condemned. Mter condemning the bodily conception of the living entities, 
how was it possible for Kr�l)a to place a conventional proposition on the 
body again? Therefore, individuality is maintained on spiritual grounds and 
is thus confirmed by great iiciiryas like Sri Ramanuja and others. It is 
clearly mentioned in many places in the Gitii that this spiritual individuality 
is understood by those who are devotees of the Lord. Those who are 
envious of Kr�l)a as the Supreme Personality of Godhead have no bona 
fide access to the great literature. The nondevotee's approach to the 
teachings of the Gitii is something like bees licking on a bottle of honey. 
One cannot have a taste of honey unless one opens the bottle. Similarly, 
the mysticism of the Bhagavad-gitii can be understood only by devotees, 
and no one else can taste it, as it is stated in the Fourth Chapter of the 
book. Nor can the Gitii be touched by persons who envy the very 
existence of the Lord. Therefore, the Mayavadi: explanation of the Gitii 
is a most misleading presentation of the whole truth. Lord Caitanya has 
forbidden us to read commentations made by the Mayavadls and warns 
that one who takes to such an understanding of the Mayavadi philosophy 
loses all power to understand the real mystery of the Gitii. If individuality 
refers to the empirical universe, then there is no need of teaching by the 
Lord. The plurality of the individual soul and of the Lord is an eternal 
fact, and it is confirmed by the Vedas as above mentioned.

TRANSLATION 
As the embodied soul continually passes, in this body, from boyhood to 
youth to old age, the soul similarly passes into another body at death. The 
self-realized soul is not bewildered by such a change. 
PURPORT 
Since every living entity is an individual soul, each is changing his body 
every moment, manifesting sometimes as a child, sometimes as a youth, 
and sometimes as an old man. Yet the same spirit souf is there and does 
not undergo any change. This individual soul finally changes the body at 
death and transmigrates to another body; and since it is sure to have 
another body in the next birth-either material or spiritual-there was no 
cause for lamentation by Arjuna on account of death, neither for Bhi�ma 
nor for Drova, for whom he was so much concerned. Rather, he should 
rejoice for their changing bodies from old to new ones, thereby rejuve­
nating their energy. S(!ch changes of body account for varieties of enjoy­
ment or suffering, according to one's work in life. So Bhi�ma and Dro!J.a, 
being noble souls, were surely going to have either spiritual bodies in the 
next life, or at least life in heavenly bodies for superior enjoyment of 
material existence. So, in either case, there was no cause of lamentation. 
Any man who has perfect knowledge of the constitution of the individu­
al soul, the Supersoul, and nature-both material and spiritual-is called a 
dhira or a most sober man. Such a man is never deluded by the change of 
bodies. The Mayavadl theory of oneness of the spirit soul cannot be enter­
tained on the ground that spirit soul cannot be cut into pieces as a frag­
mental portion. Such cutting into different individual souls would make 
the Supreme cleavable or changeable, against the principle of the Supreme 
Soul being unchangeable. 
As confirmed in the Gitii, the fragmental portions of the Supreme exist 
eternally (saniitana) and are called k§ara; that is, they have a tendency to 
fall down into material nature. These fragmental portions are eternally so, 
90 
Bhagavad-g1ta As It Is 
[Ch. 2 
and even after liberation, the individual soul remains the same-fragmental. 
But once liberated, he lives an eternal life in bliss and knowledge with the 
Personality of Godhead. The theory of reflection can be applied to the 
Supersoul who is present in each and every individual body and is known 
as the Paramatma, who is different from the individual living entity. When 
the sky is reflected in water, the reflections represent both the sun and the 
moon and the stars also. The stars can be compared to the living entities 
and the sun or the moon to the Supreme Lord. The individual fragmental 
spirit soul is represented by Arjuna, and the Supreme Soul is the Per­
sonality of Godhead Sri Kr��a. They are not on the same level, as it will be 
apparent in the beginning of the Fourth Chapter. If Arjuna is on the same 
level with Kr��a, and Kr��a is not superior to Arjuna, then their relation­
ship of instructor and instructed becomes meaningless. If both of them 
are deluded by the illusory energy (miiyii), then there is no need of one 
being the instructor and the other the instructed. Such instruction would 
be useless because, in the clutches of miiyii, no one can be an authoritative 
instructor. Under the circumstances, it is admitted that Lord Kr��a is the 
Supreme Lord, superior in position to the living entity, Arjuna, who is a 
forgotten soul deluded by miiyii.

appearance of winter and summer seasons. They arise from sense percep­
tion, 0 scion of Bharata, and one must learn to tolerate them without 
being disturbed. 
PURPORT 
In the proper discharge of duty, one has to learn to tolerate nonper­
manent appearances and disappearances of happiness and distress. Ac­
cording to Vedic injunction, one has to take his bath early in the morning 
even during the month of Miigha (January-February). It is very cold at 
that time, but in spite of that a man who abides by the religious principles 
does not hesitate to take his bath. Similarly, a woman does not hesitate to 
cook in the kitchen in the months of May and June, the hottest part of the 
summer season. One has to execute his duty in spite of climatic incon­
veniences. Similarly, to fight is the religious principle of the k§atriyas, and 
although one has to fight with some friend or relative, one should not 
deviate from his prescribed duty. One has to follow the prescribed rules 
and regulations of religious principles in order to rise up to the platform of 
knowledge because by knowledge and devotion only can one liberate him­
self from the clutches of maya (illusion). 
The two different names of address given to Arjuna are also significant. 
To address him as Kaunteya signifies his great blood relations from his 
mother's side; and to address him as Bharata signifies his greatness from 
his father's side. From both sides he is supposed to have a great heritage. 
A great heritage brings responsibility in the matter of proper discharge of 
duties; therefore, he cannot avoid fighting.

0 best among men [ Arjuna]' the person who is not disturbed by 
happiness and distress and is steady in both is certainly eligible for 
liberation. 
PURPORT 
Anyone who is steady in his determination for the advanced stage of 
spiritual realization and can equally tolerate the onslaughts of distress and 
happiness is certainly a person eligible for liberation. In the vaf!!.iiSrama 
institution, the fourth stage of life, namely the renounced order (sannyiisa), 
is a painstaking situation. But one who is serious about making his life 
perfect surely adopts the sannyiisa order of life in spite of all dif,ficulties. 
The difficulties usually arise from having to sever family relationships, to 
, give up the connection of wife and children. But if anyone is able to 
tolerate such difficulties, surely his path to spiritual realization is complete. 
Similarly, in Arjuna 's discharge of duties as a k§atriya, he is advised to 
.) 
persevere, even if it is difficult to fight with his family members or 
I 
similarly beloved persons. Lord Caitanya took sannyiisa at the age of 
twenty-four, and His dependents, young wife as well as old mother, had 
no one else to look after them. Yet for a higher cause He took sannyiisa 
and was steady in the discharge of higher duties. That is the way of 
achieving liberation from material bondage.

TRANSLATION 
Those who are seers of the truth have concluded that of the nonexistent 
there is no endurance, and of the existent there is no cessation. This 
seers have concluded by studying the nature of both. 
PURPORT 
There is no endurance of the changing body. That the body is changing 
every moment by the actions and reactions of the different cells is 
admitted by modern medical science; and thus growth and old age are 
taking place in the body. But the spirit soul exists permanently, remaining. 
the same despite all changes of the body and the mind. That is the 
difference between matter and spirit. By nature, the body is ever changing, 
and the soul is eternal. This conclusion is established by all classes of seers 
of the truth, both impersonalist and personalist. In the Vi§fl.U Puriira it 
is stated that Vi�!J.U and His abodes all have self-illuminated spiritual 
existence. "]yot'irh§i vi�rur bhavaniini vi§ru�." The words existent and 
nonexistent refer only to spirit and matter. That is the version of all seers 
of truth. 
This is the beginning of the instruction by the Lord to the living entities 
who are bewildered by the influence of ignorance. Removal of ignorance 
involves the reestablishment of the eternal relationship between the wor­
shiper and the worshipable and the consequent understanding of the 
difference between the part and parcel living entities and the Supreme 
Personality of Godhead. One can understand the nature of the Supreme 
by thorough study of oneself, the difference between oneself and the 
Supreme being understood as the relationship between the part and the 
whole. In the Vediinta-siitras, as well as in the Srimad-Bhiigavatam, the 
Supreme has been accepted as the origin of all emanations. Such emana­
tions are experienced by superior and inferior natural sequences. The living 
entities belong to the· superior nature, as it will be revealed in the Seventh 
Chapter. Although there is no difference between the energy and the 
energetic, the energetic is accepted as the Supreme, and energy or nature 
1

is accepted as the subordinate. The living entities, therefore, are always 
subordinate to the Supreme Lord, as in the case of the master and the 
servant, or the teacher and the taught. Such clear knowledge is impossible 
to understand under the spell of ignorance, and to drive away such 
ignorance the Lord teaches the Bhagavad-gitii for the enlightenment of all 
living entities for all time.

Know that which pervades the entire body is indestructible. No one is

PURPORT 
This verse more clearly explains the real nature of the soul, which is 
spread all over the body. Anyone can understand what is spread all over 
the body: it is consciousness. Everyone is conscious of the pains and 
pleasures of the body in part or as a whole. This spreading of consciousness 
is limited within one's own body. The pains and pleasures of one body are 
unknown to another. Therefore, each and every body is the embodiment 
of an individual soul, and the symptom of the soul's presence is perceived 
as individual consciousness. This soul is described as one ten-thousandth 
part of the upper portion of the hair point in size. The Svetiisvatara 
Upani§ad confirms this: 
biiliigra-sata-bhiigasya satadhii kalpitasya ca 
bhiigo jiva� sa vijiieya� sa ciinantyiiya kalpate.

"When the upper point of a hair is divided into one hundred parts and 
again each of such parts is further divided into one hundred parts, each 
such part is the measurement of the dimension of the spirit soul." (Svet. 
5.9) Similarly, in the Bhiigavatam the same version is stated: 
kdiigra-sat a-b h iigas ya satiirhsa[l siid rsiit ma ka[l 
jiva[l siik�ma-svarfipo 'yam sankh yiitito hi cit-kar-afl 
"There are innumerable particles of spiritual atoms, which are measured as 
I 
one ten-thousandth of the upper portion of the hair." 
I 
Therefore, the individual particle of spirit soul is a spiritual atom smaller 
than the material atoms, and such atoms are innumerable. This very small 
spiritual spark is the basic principle of the material body, and the influence 
of such a spiritual spark is spread all over the body as the influence of the 
active principle of some medicine spreads throughout the body. This 
current of the spirit soul is felt all over the body as consciousness, and that 
· ll 
is the proof of the presence of the soul. Any layman can understand that 
the material body minus consciousness is a dead body, and this conscious-
ness cannot be revived in the body by any means of material administra-
tion. Therefore, consciousness is not due to any amount of material 
combination, but to the spirit soul. In the Mur-flaka Upani�ad the measure-
ment of the atomic spirit soul is further explained: 
e§O 'r-uriitmii cetasii veditavyo 
yasmin priir-afl paiicadhii sarhvivda 
priir-ais cittarh sarvam otam prajiiniirh 
yasmin visuddhe vibhavaty e§a iitmii. 
"The soul is atomic in size and can be perceived by perfect intelligence. 
This atomic soul is floating 'in the five kinds of air [prii[la, apiina, vyiina, 
samiina and udiina J, is situated within the heart, and spreads its influence 
all over the body of the embodied living entities. When the soul is purified 
from
. 
the contamination of the five kinds of material air, its spiritual 
influence is exhibited." (Mur-fl- 3.1.9) 
The hatha-yoga system is meant for controlling the five kinds of air 
encircling the pure soul by different kinds of sitting postures-not for any 
material profit, but for liberation of the minute soul from the entangle­
ment of the material atmosphere. 
So the constitution of the atomic soul is admitted in ail Vedic literatures, 
and it is also actually felt in the practical experience of any sane man. Only 
the insane man can think of this atomic soul as all-pervading Viuw-tattva. 
The influence of the atomic soul can be spread all over a particular

body. According to the Murflaka Upani§ad, this atomic soul is situated in 
the heart of every living entity, and because the measurement of the atomic 
soul is beyond the power of appreciation of the material scientists, some 
of them assert foolishly that there is no soul. The individual atomic soul 
is definitely there in the heart along with the Supersoul, and thus all the 
energies of bodily movement are emanating from this part of the body. 
The corpuscles which carry the oxygen from the lungs gather energy from 
the soul. When the soul passes away from this position, activity of the 
blood, generating fusion, ceases. Medical science accepts the importance of 
the red corpuscles, but it cannot ascertain that the source of the energy is 
the soul. Medical science, however, does admit that the heart is the seat of 
all energies of the body. 
Such atomic particles of the spirit whole are compared to the sunshine 
molecules. In the sunshine there are innumerable radiant molecules. 
Similarly, the fragmental parts of the Supreme Lord are atomic sparks of 
the rays of the Supreme Lord, called by the name prabhii or superior 
energy. Neither Vedic knowledge nor modern science denies the existence 
of the spirit soul in the body, and the science of the soul is explicitly 
described in the Bhagavad-gitii by the Personality of Godhead Himself .

PURPORT 
The material body is perishable by nature. It may perish immediately, 
or it may do so after a hundred years. It is a question of time only. There 
is no chance of maintaining it indefinitely. But the spirit soul is so minute 
that it cannot even be seen by an enemy, to say nothing of being killed. 
As mentioned in the previous verse, it is so small that no one can have any 
idea how to measure its dimension. So from both viewpoints there is no 
cause of larp.entation because the living entity can neither be killed as he is, 
nor can the material body, which cannot be saved for any length of time, be 
permanently protected. The minute particle of the whole spirit acquires 
this material body according to his work, and therefore observance of 
religious principles should be utilized. In the Vediinta-idltras the living 
entity is qualified as light because he is part and parcel of the supreme 
light. As sunlight maintains the entire universe, so the light of the soul 
maintains this material body. As soon as the spirit soul is out of this 
material body, the body begins to decompose; therefore it is the spirit 
soul which maintains this body. The body itself is unimportant. Arjuna 
was advised to fight and sacrifice the material body for the cause of 
religion.

When an embodied living entity is hurt by fatal weapons, it is to be 
known that the living entity within the body is not killed. The spirit soul 
is so small that it is impossible to kill him by any material weapon, as is 
evident from the previous verses. Nor is the living entity killable because 
of his spiritual constitution. What is killed, or is supposed to be killed, 
is the body only. This, however, does not at all encourage killing of 
the body. The Vedic injunction is, "mahimsya-t saroa-bhutani," never 
commit violence to anyone. Nor does understanding that the living entity 
is not killed encourage animal slaughter. Killing the body of anyone with­
out authority is abominable and is punishable by the law of the state as 
well as by the law of the Lord. Arjuna, however, is being engaged in killing 
for the principle of religion, and not whimsically.

PURPORT 
Qualitatively, the small atomic fragmental part of the Supreme Spirit is 
one with the Supreme. He undergoes no changes like the body. Sometimes 
the soul is called the steady, or kiitastha. The body is subject to six kinds 
of transformations. It takes its birth in the womb of the mother's body, 
remains for some time, grows, produces some effects, gradually dwindles, 
and at last vanishes into oblivion. The soul, however, does not go through 
such changes. The soul is riot born, but, because he takes on a material 
body, the body takes its birth. The soul does not take birth there, and the 
soul does not die. Anything which has birth also has death. And because 
the soul has no birth, he therefore has no past, present or future. He is 
eternal, ever-existing, and primeval-that is, there is no trace in history of 
his coming into being. Under the impression of the body, we seek the 
history of birth, etc., of the soul. The soul does not at any time become 
old, as the body does. The so-called old man, therefore, feels himself to be 
in the same spirit as in his childhood or youth. The changes of the body do 
not affect the soul. The soul does not deteriorate like a tree, nor anything 
material. The soul has no by-product either. The by-products of the body, 
namely children, are also different individual souls; and, owing to the 
body, they appear as children of a particular man. The body develops 
because of the soul's presence, but the soul has neither offshoots nor 
change. Therefore, the soul is free from the six changes of the body. 
In the Katha Upani�ad also we find a similar passage which reads: 
na jiiyate mriyate vii vipascin 
niiyarh kutascin na vibhiiva kascit 
ajo nityaft siisvato 'yarh puriir-o 
na han yate han yamiine sarire. 
(Katha 1.2.18) 
) 
The meaning and purport of this verse is the same as in the Bhagavad-gitii, 
but here in this verse there is one special word, vipascit, which means 
learned or with knowledge. 
The soul is full of knowledge, or full always with consciousness. There­
fore, consciousness is the symptom of the soul. Even if one does not find 
the soul within the heart, where he is situated, one can still understand 
the presence of the soul simply by the presence of consciousness. Some­
times we do not find the sun in the sky owing to clouds, or for some other 
reason, but the light of the sun is always there, and we are convinced that 
it is therefore daytime. As soon as there is a little light in the sky early in 
!· 
]I< 
100 
Bhagavad-gita As It Is 
[Ch. 2 
the morning, we can understand that the sun is in the sky. Similarly, since 
there is some consciousness in all bodies-whether man or animal-we can 
understand the presence of the soul. This consciousness of the soul is, 
however, different from the consciousness of the Supreme because the 
supreme consciousness is all-knowledge-past, present and future. The 
consciousness of the individual soul is prone to be forgetful. When he is 
forgetful of his real nature, he obtains education and enlightenment from 
the superior lessons of Kr�!J.a. But Kf�!la is not like the forgetful soul. If so, 
Kr�!la's teachings of Bhagavad-gitii would be useless. 
There are two kinds of souls-namely the minute particle soul (arw­
iitmii) and the Supersoul (the vibhu-iitmii). This is also confirmed in the 
Katha Upani�ad in this way: 
arwr aviyiin mahato mahiyiin 
iitmiisya jantor nihito guhiiyiim 
tam akratu[l pasyati vita-soko 
dhiitu[l prasiidiin mahimiinam iitmana[l 
(Katha 1.2.20) 
"Both the Supersoul [Paramiitmii 1 and the atomic soul [jiviitmii 1 are 
situated on the same tree of the body within the same heart of the living 
being, and only one who has become free from all material desires as well 
as lamentations can, by the grace of the Supreme, understand the glories of 
the soul." Kr�!la is the fountainhead of the Supersoul also, as it will be 
disclosed in the following chapters, and Arjuna is the atomic soul, forget­
ful of his real nature; therefore he requires to be enlightened by Kr�!J.a, or 
by His bona fide representative (the spiritual master).

PURPORT 
Everything has its proper utility, and a man who is situated in complete 
knowledge kriows how and where to apply a thing for its proper utility. 
Similarly, violence also has its utility, and how to apply violence rests with 
the person in knowledge. Although the justice of the peace awards capital 
punishment to a person condemned for murder, the justice of the peace 
cannot be blamed because he orders violence to another person according 
to the codes of justice. In Manu-sarhhitii, the lawbook for mankind, it is 
supported that a murderer should be condemned to death so that in his 
next life he will not have to suffer for the great sin he has committed. 
Therefore, the king's punishment of ha�ng a murderer is actually 
beneficial. Similarly, when Kr�J).a orders fighting, it must be concluded 
that violence is for supreme justice, and, as such, Arjuna should follow 
the instruction, knowing well that such violence, committed in the act of 
fighting for Kr�J).a, is not violence at all because, at any rate, the man, or 
rather the soul, cannot be killed; so for the administration of justice, so­
called violence is permitted. A surgical operation is not meant to kill the 
patient, but to cure him. Therefore the fighting to be executed by Arjuna 
at the instruction of Kr�pa is with full knowledge, so there is no possibility 
of sinful reaction.

TRANSLATION 
As a person puts on new garments, giving up old ones, similarly, the 
soul accepts new material bodies, giving up the old and useless ones. 
PURPORT 
Change of body by the atomic individual soul is an accepted fact. Even 
some of the modern scientists who do not believe in the existence of the 
soul, but at the same time cannot explain the source of energy from the 
heart, have to accept continuous changes of body which appear from 
childhood to b,ayhood and from boyhood to youth and again from youth 
to old age. From old age, the change is transferred to another body. 
This has already been explained in the previous verse. 
Transference of the atomic individual soul to another body is made 
possible by the grace of the Supersoul. The Supersoul fulfills the desire of 
the atomic soul as one friend fulfills the desire of another. The Vedas, 
like the Murflaka Upani§ad, as well as the Svetiisvatara Upani§ad, compare 
the soul and the Supersoul to two friendly birds sitting on the same tree. 
One of the birds (the individual atomic soul) is eating the fruit of the tree, 
and the other bird (Kr��a) is simply watching His friend. Of these two 
birds-although they are the same in quality-one is captivated by the 
fruits of the material tree, while the other is simply witnessing the 
activities of His friend. Kr��a is the witnessing bird, and Arjuna is 
the eating bird. Although they are friends, one is still the master and the 
other is the servant. Forgetfulness of this relationship by' the atomic soul 
is the cause of one's changing his position from one tree to another or 
from one body to another. The jiva soul is struggling very hard on the tree 
of the material body, but as soon as he agrees to accept the other bird as 
Text 23] 
Contents of the Gita Summarized 
103-
the supreme spiritual master-as Arjuna agreed to do by voluntary surrender 
unto Kr�!la for instruction-the subordinate bird immediately becomes 
free from all lamentations. Both the Katha Upani�ad and Svetiisvatara 
Upani�ad confirm this: 
samiine vrk�e puru�o nimagno 
'nisayii socati muh yamiina� 
ju�tam yadii pasyaty an yam isam asya 
mahimiinam iti vita-soka� 
"Although the two birds are in the same tree, the eating bird is fully 
engrossed with anxiety and moroseness as the enjoyer of the fruits of the 
tree. But if in some way or other he turns his face to his friend who is the 
Lord and knows His glories-at once the suffering bird becomes free from 
all anxieties." Arjuna has now turned his face towards his eternal friend, 
Kr�!la, and is understanding the Bhagavad-gitii from Him. And thus, hear­
ing from Kr�!la, he can understand the supreme glories of the Lord and be 
free from lamentation. 
Arjuna is advised herewith by the Lord not to lament for the bodily 
change of his old grandfather and his teacher. He should rather be happy 
to kill their bodies in the righteous fight so that they may be cleansed at 
once of all reactions from various bodily activities. One who lays down 
his life on the sacrificial altar, or in the proper battlefield, is at once 
cleansed of bodily reactions and promoted to a higher status of life. So 
there was no cause for Arjuna 's lamentation.

TRANSLATION 
The soul can never be cut into pieces by any weapon, nor can he be 
burned by fire, nor moistened by water, nor withered by the wind. 
PURPORT 
All kinds of weapons, swords, flames, rains, tornadoes, etc., are unable 
to kill the spirit soul. It appears that there were many kinds of weapons 
made of earth, water, air, ether, etc., in addition to the modern weapons 
of fire. Even the nuclear weapons of the modern age are classified as fire 
weapons, but formerly there were other weapons made of all different types 
of material elements. Firearms were counteracted by water weapons, which 
are now unknown to modern science. Nor do modern scientists have 
knowledge of tornado weapons. Nonetheless, the soul can never be cut 
into pieces, nor annihilated by any number of weapons, regardless of 
scientific devices. 
Nor was it ever possible to cut the individual souls from the original 
Soul. The Mayavadl, however, cannot describe how the individual soul 
evolved from ignorance and consequently became covered by illusory 
energy. Because they are atomic individual souls (saniitana) eternally, they 
are prone to be covered by the illusory energy, and thus they become 
separated from the association of the Supreme Lord, just as the sparks of 
the fire, although one in quality with the fire, are prone to be extinguished 
when out of the fire. In the Variiha Puriirw, the living entities are described 
as separated parts and parcels of the Supreme. They are eternally so, 
according to the Bhagavad-gitii also. So, even after being liberated from 
illusion, the living entity remains a separate identity, as is evident from 
the teachings of the Lord to Arjuna. Arjuna became liberated by the 
knowledge received from Kr��a, but he never became one with Kr��a.

TRANSLATION 
This individual soul is unbreakable and. insoluble, and can be neither

and eternally the same. 
PURPORT 
All these qualifications of the atomic soul definitely prove that the 
individual soul is eternally the atomic particle of the spirit whole, and he 
remains the same atom eternally, without change. The theory of monism 
is very difficult to apply in this case, because the individual soul is never 
expected to become one homogeneously. After liberation from material 
contamination, the atomic soul may prefer to remain as a spiritual spark 
in the effulgent rays of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, but the 
intelligent souls enter into the spiritual planets to associate with the 
Personality of Godhead. 
The word sarva-gata� (all-pervading) is significant because there is no 
doubt that living entities are all over God's creation. They live on the 
land, in the water, in the air, within the earth and even within fire. The 
belief that they are sterilized in fire is not acceptable, because it is clearly 
stated here that the soul cannot be burned by fire. Therefore, there is no 
doubt that there are living entities also in the sun planet with suitable 
bodies to live there. If the sun globe is uninhabited, then the word 
sarva-gata�-living everywhere-becomes meaningless.

TRANSLATION 
It is said that the soul is invisible, inconceivable, immutable, and un­

PURPORT 
As described previously, the magnitude of the soul is so small for our 
material calculation that he cannot be seen even by the most powerful 
microscope; therefore, he is invisible. As far as the soul's existence is 
concerned, no one can establish his existence experimentally beyond the 
proof of sruti, or Vedic wisdom. We have to accept this truth, because 
there is no other source of understanding the existence of the soul,, 
although it is a fact by perception. There are many things we have to 
accept solely on grounds of superior authority. No one can deny the 
existence of his father, based upon the authority of his mother. There is 
no other source of understanding the identity of the father except by the 
authority of the mother. Similarly, there is no other source of understand­
ing the soul except by studying the Vedas. In other words, the soul is 
inconceivable by human experimental knowledge. The soul is conscious­
ness and conscious-that also is the statement of the Vedas, and we have 
to accept that. Unlike the bodily changes, there is no change in the soul. 
As eternally unchangeable, the soul remains atomic in comparison to the 
infinite Supreme Soul. The Supreme Soul is infinite, and the atomic soul 
is infinitesimal. Therefore, the infinitesimal soul, being unchangeable, can 
never become equal to the infinite soul, or the Supreme Personality of 
Godhead. This concept is repeated in the Vedas in different ways just to 
confirm the stability of the conception of the soul. Repetition of some­
thing is necessary in order that we understand the matter thoroughly, · 
without error.

TRANSLATION 
If, however, you think that the soul is perpetually born and always dies, 
still you have no reason to lament, 0 mighty-armed. 
PURPORT 
There is always a class of philosophers, almost akin to the Buddhists, 
who do not believe in the separate existence of the soul beyond the body. 
When Lord Krwa spoke the Bhagavad-gitii, it appears that such philoso­
phers existed, and they were known as the Lokiiyatikas and Vaibhii�ikas. 
These philosophers maintained that life symptoms, or soul, takes place at 
a certain mature condition of material combination. The modern material 
scientist and materialist philosophers also think similarly. According to 
them, the body is a combination of physical elements, and at a certain 
stage the life symptoms develop by interaction of the physical and 
chemical elements. The science of anthropology is based on this philoso­
phy. 
Currently, many pseudo-religions-now becoming fashionable in 
America-are also adhering to this philosophy, as well as to the nihilistic 
nondevotional Buddhist sects. 
· 
Even if Arjuna did not believe in the existence of the soul-as in the 
Vaibhii§ika philosophy-there would still have been no cause for lamenta­
tion. No one laments the loss of a certain. bulk of chemicals and stops 
discharging his prescribed duty. On the other hand, in modern science and 
scientific warfare, so many tons of chemicals are wasted for achieving 
victory over the enemy. According to the Vaibhii�ika philosophy, the so­
called soul or iitmii vanishes along with the deterioration of the body. So, 
in any case, whether Arjuna accepted the Vedic conclusion that there is an 
atomic soul, or whether he did not believe in the existence of the soul, he 
had no reason to lament. According to this theory, since there are so many 
I 
� 
108 
Bhagavad-gita As It Is 
[Ch. 2 
living entities generating out of matter every moment, and so many of 
them are being vanquished every moment, there is no need to grieve for 
such an incidence. However, since he was not risking rebirth of the soul, 
Arjuna had no reason to be afraid of being affected with sinful reactions 
due to his killing his grandfather and teacher. But at the same time, Kr�!la 
sarcastically addressed Arjuna as mahii-biihu, mighty-armed, because He, 
at least, did not accept the theory of the Vaibhii§ikas, which leaves aside 
the Vedic wisdom. As a k§atriya, Arjuna belonged to the Vedic culture, 
and it behooved him to continue to follow its principles.

For one who has taken his birth, death is certain; and for one who is

One has to take birth according to one's activities of life. And, after 
finishing one term of activities, one has to die to take birth for the next. 
In this way the cycle of birth and death is revolving, one after the other 
without liberation. This cycle of birth and death does not, however, 
support unnecessary murder, slaughter and war. But at the same time,

The Battle of Kuruk�etra, being the will of the Supreme, was an in­
evitable event, and to fight for the right cause is the duty of a k§atriya. 
Why should he be afraid of or aggrieved at the death of his relatives since 
he was discharging his proper duty? He did not deserve to break the law, 
thereby becoming subjected to the reactions of sinful acts, of which he 
was so afraid. By avoiding the discharge of his proper duty, he-would not 
be able to stop the death of his relatives, and he would be degraded due to 
his selection of the wrong path of action.

TRANSLATION 
All created beings are unmanifest in their beginning, manifest in their 
interim state, and unmanifest again when they are annihilated. So what 
need is there for lamentation? 
PURPORT 
Accepting that there are two classes of philosophers, one believing in 
the existence of soul and the other not believing in the existence of the 
soul, there is no cause for lamentation in either case. Nonbelievers in the 
existence of the soul are called atheists by followers of Vedic wisdom. Yet 
even if, for argument's sake, we accept the atheistic theory, there is still no 
IIO 
Bhagavad-gita As It Is 
[Ch. 2. 
cause for lamentation. Apart from the separate existence of the soul, the 
material elements remain unmanifested before creation. From this subtle 
state of unmanifestation comes manifestation, just as from ether, air is 
generated; from air, fire is generated; from fire, water is generated; and 
from water, earth .becomes manifested. From the earth, many varieties of 
manifestations take place. Take, for example, a big skyscraper manifested 
from the earth. When it is dismantled, the manifestation becomes again 
unmanifested and remains as atoms in the ultimate stage. The law of con­
servation of energy remains, but _in course of time things are manifested 
and unmanifested-that is the difference. Then what cause is there for 
lamentation either in the stage of manifestation or unmanifestation? 
Somehow or other, even in the unmanifested stage, things are not lost. 
Both at the beginning and at the end, all elements remain unmanifested, 
and only in the middle are they manifested, and this does not make any 
real material difference. 
And if we accept the Vedic conclusion as stated in the Bhagavad-gitii 
( antavanta ime dehii[l) that these material bodies are perishable in due 
course of time (nityasyoktii[l saririrw[l) but that soul is eternal, then we 
must remember always that the body is like a dress; therefore why lament 
the changing of a dress? The material body has no factual existence in 
relation to the eternal soul. It is something like a dream. In a dream we 
may think of flying in the sky, or sitting on a chariot as a king, but when 
we wake up we can see that we are neither in the sky nor seated on the 
chariot. The Vedic wisdom encourages self-realization on the basis of the 
nonexistence of the material body. Therefore, in either case, whether one 
believes in the existence of the soul, or one does not believe in the exis­
tence of the soul, there is no cause for lamentation for loss of the body.

TRANSLATION 
Some look on the soul as amazing, some describe him as amazing, and 
some hear of him as amazing, while others, even after hearing about him, 
cannot understand him at all. 
PURPORT 
Since Gitopani§ad is largely based on the principles of the Upani§ads, 
it is not surprising to also find this passage in the Katha Upani§ad. · 
sravar-iiyiipi bahubhir yo na labhyaft 
snwanto 'pi bahavo yaft na vidyuft 
iiscaryo vaktii kusalo 'sya labdhii 
iiscaryo jniitii kusaliinusi§taft. 
The fact that the atomic soul is within the body of a gigantic animal, 
in the body of a gigantic banyan tree, and also in the microbic germs, 
millions and billions of which occupy only an inch of space, is certainly 
very amazing. Men with a poor fund of knowledge and men who are not 
austere cannot understand the wonders of the individual atomic spark of 
spirit, even though it is explained by the greatest authority of knowledge, 
who imparted lessons even to Brahma, the first living being in the universe. 
Owing to a gross m·aterial conception of things, most men in this age 
cannot imagine how such a small particle can become both so great and so 
small. So men look at the soul proper as wonderful either by constitution 
or by description. Illusioned by the material energy, people are so engrossed 
in subject matter for sense gratification that they have very little time 
to understand the question of self-understanding, even though it is a fact 
that without this self-understanding all activities result in ultimate defeat 
in the struggle for existence. Perhaps one has no idea that one must think 
of the soul, and also make a solution of the material miseries. 
Some people who are inclined to hear about the soul may be attending 
lectures, in good association, but sometimes, owing to ignorance, they 
112 
Bhagavad-gita As It Is 
[Ch. 2· 
are misguided by acceptance of the Supersoul and the atomic soul as one 
without distinction of magnitude. It is very difficult to find a man who 
perfectly understands the position of the soul, the Supersoul, the atomic 
soul, their respective functions, relationships and all other major and 
minor details. And it is still more difficult to find a man who has actually 
derived full benefit from knowledge of the soul, and who is able to 
describe the position of the soul in different aspects. But if, somehow 
or other, one is able to understand the subject matter of the soul, then 
one's life is successful. The easiest process for understanding the subject 
matter of self, however, is to accept the statements of the Bhagavad-gitii 
spoken by the greatest authority, Lord Kr�pa, without being deviated by 
other theories. But it also requires a great deal of penance and sacrifice, 
either in this life or in the previous ones, before one is able to accept Krwa 
as the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Kf�pa can, however, be known as 
such by the causeless mercy of the pure devotee and by no other way.

establishes that the soul is immortal and the body is temporary. Therefore 
Arjuna as a k§atriya should not abandon his duty out of fear that his 
grandfather and teacher-Bhi�ma and Drm;a-will die in the battle. On 
the authority of Sri Kr��a, one has to believe that there is a soul different 
from the material body, not that there is no such thing as soul, or that 
living symptoms develop at a certain stage of material maturity resulting 
from the interaction of chemicals. Though the soul is immortal, violence 
is not encouraged, but at the time of war it is not discouraged when there 
is actual need for it. That need must be justified in terms of the sanction 
of the Lord, and not capriciously.

TRANSLATION 
Considering your specific duty as a �triya, you should know that there 
is no better engagement for you than fighting on religious principles; and 
so there is no need for hesitation. 
PURPORT 
Out of the four orders of social administration, the second order, for 
the matter of good administration, is called k§atriya. K§at means hurt. One 
who gives protection from harm is called k§atriya (trayate-to give protec-
l 
I· 
114 
Bhagavad-glta As It Is 
[Ch. 2 . 
tion). The k§atriyas are trained for killing in the forest. A k§atriya would 
go into the forest and challenge a tiger face to face and fight with the 
tiger with his sword. When the tiger was killed, it would be offered the 
royal order of cremation. This system is being followed even up to the 
present day by the k§atriya kings of Jaipur state. The k§atriyas are 
specially trained for challenging and killing because religious violence is 
· sometimes a necessary factor. Therefore, k§atriyas are never meant for 
accepting directly the order of sannyiisa or renunciation. Nonviolence in 
politics may be a diplomacy, but it is never a factor or principle. In the 
religious law books it is stated: 
iihave§u mitho 'nyonyarh jighiirhsanto mahik§itaft 
yuddhamiiniift pararh saktyii svargarh yiinty apariinmukhiift 
yajfie§u pasavo brahman hanyante satatarh dvijaift 
sarhskrtiift kila mantrais ca te 'pi svargam aviipnuvan. 
"In the battlefield, a king or k§atriya, while fighting another king envious 
of him, is eligible for achieving heavenly planets after death, as the briih­
ma11as also attain the heavenly planets by sacrificing animals in the sacrifi­
cial fire." Therefore, killing on the battle on the religious principle and 
the killing of animals in the sacrificial fire are not at all considered to be 
acts of violence, because everyone is benefitted by the religious principles 
involved. The animal sacrificed gets a human life immediately without 
undergoing the gradual evolutionary process from one form to another, 
and the k§atriyas killed in the battlefield also attain the heavenly planets 
as do the briihma11as who attain them by offering sacrifice. 
There are two kinds of svadharmas, specific duties. As long as one is 
not liberated, one has to perform the duties of that particular body in 
accordance with religious principles in order to achieve liberation. When 
one is liberated, one's svadharma-specific duty-becomes spiritual and is 
not in the material bodily concept. In the bodily conception of life there 
are specific duties for the briihma11as and k§atriyas respectively, and such 
duties are unavoidable. Svadharma is ordained by the Lord, and this will 
be clarified in the Fourth Chapter. On the bodily plane svadharma is called 
vaT"[Liisrama-dharma, or man's steppingstone for spiritual understanding. 
Human civilization begins from the stage of var11iisrama-dharma, or specific 
duties in terms of the specific modes of nature of the body obtained. 
Discharging one's specific duty in any field of action in accordance with 
vaT"[Liisrama-dharma serves to elevate one to a higher status of life.

PURPORT 
As supreme teacher of the world, Lord Kr�!la condemns the attitude of 
Arjuna who said, "I do not find any good in this fighting. It will cause 
perpetual habitation in hell." Such statements by Arjuna were due to 
ignorance only. He wanted to become nonviolent in the discharge of his 
specific duty. For a k§atriya to be in the battlefield and to become non­
violent is the philosophy of fools. In the Pariisara-smrti or religious codes 
made by Parasara, the great sage and father of Vyasadeva, it is stated: 
k§atriyo hi prajii rak§an sastra-piir-ift pradar-{iayan 
nirjitya parasainyiidi k§itirit dharmer-a piilayet. 
"The k§atriya 's duty is to protect the citizens from all kinds of difficulties, 
and for that reason he has to apply violence in suitable cases for law and 
order. Therefore he has to conquer the soldiers of inimical kings, and thus, 
with religious principles, he should rule over the world." 
Considering all aspects, Arjuna had no reason to refrain from fighting. 
If he should conquer his enemies, he would enjoy the kingdom; and if he 
should die in the battle, he would be elevated to the heavenly planets 
whose doors were wide open to him. Fighting would be for his benefit in 
either case.

If, however, you do not fight this religious war, then you will certainly

PURPORT 
Arjuna was a famous fighter, and he attained fame by fighting many 
great demigods, including even Lord Siva. After fighting and defeating 
Lord Siva in the dress of a hunter, Arjuna pleased the Lord and received as 
a reward a weapon called piisupata-astra. Everyone knew that he was a 
great warrior. Even Dro!lacarya gave him benediction and awarded him 
the special weapon by which he could kill even his teacher. So he was 
credited with so many military certificates from many authorities, includ­
ing his adopted father lndra, the heavenly king. But if he abandoned the 
battle, he would not only neglect his specific duty as a k§atriya, but he 
would lose all his fame and good name and thus prepare his royal road to 
hell. In other words, he would go to hell, not by fighting, but by with­
drawing from battle.

PURPORT 
Both as friend and philosopher to Arjuna, Lord Kr�rta now gives His 
final judgement regarding Arjuna 's refusal to fight. The Lord says," Arjuna, 
if you leave the battlefield, people will call you a coward even before 
your actual flight. And if you think that people may call you bad names 
but that you will save your life by fleeing the battlefield, then My advice 
is that you'd do better to die in the battle. For a respectable man like you, 
ill fame is worse than death. So, you should not flee for fear of your life; 
better to die in the battle. That will save you from the ill fame of misusing 
My friendship and from losing your prestige in society." 
So, the final judgement of the Lord was for Arjuna to die in the battle 
and not withdraw.

the great generals like Duryodhana, Kar�a, and other contemporaries will 
think that you have left the battlefield out of compassion for your 
brothers and grandfather. They will think that you have left out of fear 
for your life. And thus their high estimation of your personality will go

Do thou fight for the sake of fighting, without considering happiness

PURPORT 
Lord Kr�lJa now directly says that Arjuna should fight for the sake of 
fighting because He desires the battle. There is no consideration of 
happiness or distress, profit or gain, victory or defeat in the activities of 
Kr�lJa consciousness. That everything should be performed for the sake of 
Kr�lJa is transcendental consciousness; so there is no reaction to material 
activities. He who acts for his own sense gratification, either in goodness 
or in passion, is subject to the reaction, good or bad. But he who has 
completely surrendered himself in the activities of Kr�lJa consciousness is 
no longer obliged to anyone, nor is he a debtor to anyone, as one is in the 
ordinary course of activities. It is said: 
devar�i-bhiitiipta-nrr-am pitfr-iim 
na kinkaro niiyamrr-i ca riijan 
sarviitmanii ya� sarar-am sarar-yam 
gato mukundam parihrtya kartam 
(Bhiig. 11.5.41) 
"Anyone who has completely surrendered unto Kr�l)a, Mukunda, giving 
up all other duties, is no longer a debtor, nor is he obliged to anyone-not 
the demigods, nor the sages, nor the people in general, nor kinsmen, nor 
humanity, nor forefathers." That is the indirect hint given by Krwa to 
Arjuna in this verse, and the matter will be more clearly explained in the 
following verses.

Thus far I have declared to you the analytical knowledge of sarikhya 
philosophy. Now listen to the knowledge of yoga whereby one works 
without fruitive result. 0 son of Prtha, when you act by such intelligence, 
you can free yourself from the bondage of works. 
PURPORT 
According to the Nirukti, or the Vedic dictionary, sankhya means that 
which describes phenomena in detail, and sankhya refers to that philosophy 
which describes the real nature of the soul. And yoga involves controlling 
the senses. Arjuna 's proposal not to fight was based on sense gratification. 
Forgetting his prime duty, he wanted to cease fighting because he thought 
that by not killing his relatives and kinsmen he would be happier than by 
enjoying the kingdom by conquering his cousins and brothers, the sons of 
Dh[tara�tra. In both ways, the basic principles were for sense gratification. 
Happiness derived from conquering them and happiness derived by seeing 
kinsmen alive are both on the basis of personal sense gratification, for 
there is a sacrifice of wisdom and duty. K[�l)a, therefore, wanted to 
explain to Arjuna that by killing the body of his grandfather he would 
not be killing the soul proper, and He explained that all individual persons, 
including the Lord Himself, are eternal individuals; they were individuals 
in the past, they are individuals in the present, and they will continue to 
remain individuals in the future, because all of us are individual souls 
·eternally, and we simply change our bodily dress in different manners. But, 
actually, we keep our individuality even after liberation from the bondage 
of material dress. An analytical study of the soul and the body has been 
very graphically explained by Lord K[�l)a. And this descriptive knowledge 
of the soul and the body from different angles of vision has been described 
i

122 
Bhagavad-gita As It Is 
[Ch. 2 
here as siinkhya, in terms of the Nirukti dictionary. This siinkhya has 
nothing to do with the siinkhya philosophy of the atheist Kapila. Long 
before the imposter Kapila's siinkhya, the siinkhya philosophy was ex­
pounded in the Srimad-Bhiigavatam by the true Lord Kapila, the incarna­
tion of Lord Kr�!J.a, who explained it to His mother, Devahuti. It is clearly 
explained by Him that the Puru§a, or the Supreme Lord, is active and 
that He creates by looking over the prakrti. This is accepted in the Vedas 
and in the Gitii. The description in the Vedas indicates that the Lord 
glanced over the prakrti, or nature, and impregnated it with atomic 
individuals souls. All these individuals are working in the material world 
for sense gratification, and under the spell of material energy they are 
thinking of being enjoyers. This mentality is dragged to the last point of 
liberation when the living entity wants to become one with the Lord. 
This is the last snare of miiyii or sense gratificatory illusion, and it is only 
after many, many births of such sense gratificatory activities that a great 
soul surrenders unto Vasudeva, Lord Kr�!J.a, thereby fulfilling the search 
after the ultimate truth. 
Arjuna has already accepted Kr�!la as his spiritual master by surrendering 
himself unto Him: si§yas te 'harh siidhi miirh tviirh prapannam. Consequent­
ly, Kr!)Q.a will now tell him about the working process in buddhi-_yoga, or 
karma-yoga, or in other words, the practice of devotional service only for 
the sense gratification of the Lord. This buddhi-yoga is clearly explained in 
Chapter Ten, verse ten, as being direct communion with the Lord, who is 
sitting as Paramatma in everyone's heart. But such communion does not 
take place without devotional service. One who is therefore situated in 
devotional or transcendental loving service to the Lord, or, in other words, 
in Kr�!la consciousness, attains to this stage of buddhi-yoga by the special 
grace of the Lord. The Lord says, therefore, that only to those who are 
always engaged in devotional service out of transcendental love does He 
award the pure knowledge of devotion in love. In that way the devotee 
can reach Him easily in the ever-blissful kingdom of God. 
Thus the buddhi-yoga mentioned in this verse is the devotional service 
of the Lord, and the word siinkhya mentioned herein has nothing to do 
with the atheistic siinkhya-yoga enunciated by the impostor Kapila. One 
should not, therefore, misunderstand that the siinkhya-yoga mentioned 
herein has any connection with the atheistic siinkhya. Nor did that philoso­
phy have any influence during that time; nor would Lord Kr�?Q.a care to 
mention such godless philosophical speculations. Real siinkhya philosophy 
is described by Lord Kapila in the Srimad-Bhiigavatam, but even that 
Text 40]

siinkhya has nothing to do with the current topics. Here, siinkhya means 
analytical description of the body and the soul. Lord Kr�!la made an 
analytical description of the soul just to bring Arjuna to the point of 
buddhi-yoga, or bhakti-yoga. Therefore, Lord Kr�!!a's siinkhya and Lord 
Kapila's siinkhya, as described in the Bhiigavatam, are one and the same. 
They are all bhakti-yoga. He said, therefore, that only the less intelligent 
class of men make a distinction between siinkhya-yoga and bhakti-yoga. 
Of course, atheistic siinkhya-yoga has nothing to do with bhakti-yoga, 
yet the unintelligent claim that the atheistic siinkhya-yoga is referred to in 
the Bhagavad-gitii. 
One should therefore understand that buddhi-yoga means to work in 
Kr�!!a consciousness, in the full bliss and knowledge of devotional service. 
One who works for the satisfaction ofthe, Lord only, however difficult 
such work may be, is working under the principles of buddhi�yoga and 
finds himself always in transcendental bliss. By such transcendental en­
gagement, one achieves all transcendental qualities automatically, by the 
grace of the Lord, and thus his liberation is complete in itself, without his 
making extraneous endeavors to acquire knowledge. There is much differ­
ence between work in Kf�J).a consciousness and work for fruitive results, 
especially in the matter of sense gratification for achieving results in terms 
of family or material happiness. Buddhi-yoga is therefore the transcen­
dental quality of the work that we perform.

Bhagavad -glta As It Is 
[Ch. 2 
TRANSLATION 
In this endeavor there is no loss or diminution, and a little advancement 
on this path can protect one from the most dangerous type of fear. 
PURPORT 
Activity in Kr�!la consciousness, or acting for the benefit of Kr�!la 
without expectation of sense gratification, is the highest transcendental 
quality of work. Even a small beginning of such activity finds no impedi­
ment, nor can that small beginning be lost at any stage. Any wo'rk begun 
on the material plane has to be completed, otherwise the whole attempt 
becomes a failure. But any work begun in Kr�!la consciousness has a 
permanent effect, even though not finished. The performer of such work 
is therefore not at a loss even if his work in Kr�!la consciousness is incom­
plete. One percent done in Kr�!la consciousness bears permanent results, 
so that the next beginning is from the point of two percent; whereas, in 
material activity, without a hundred percent success, there is no profit. 
Ajamila performed his duty in some percentage of Kr�!la consciousness, 
but the result he enjoyed at the end was a hundred percent, by the grace 
of the Lord. There is a nice verse in this connection in Srimad-Bhiigavatam: 
tyaktvii sva-dharmarh carar-iimbujarh harer 
bhajan na pakko'tha patet tato yadi 
yatra kva viibhadram abhiid amu§ya kirh 
ko viirtha iipto'bhajatiirh sva-dharmataft 
"If someone gives up self-gratificatory pursuits and works in Kr��a 
consciousness and then falls down on account of not completing his work, 
what loss is there on his part? And,what can one gain if one performs his 
material activities perfectly?" (Bhag. 1.5.17) Or, as the Christians say, 
"What profiteth a man if he gain the whole world yet suffers the loss of his 
eternal soul?" 
Material activities and their results end with the body. But work in 
Kr�!la consciousness carries the person again to Kr�!la consciousness, even 
after the loss of the body. At least one is sure to have a chance in the next 
life of being born again as a human being , either in the family of a great 
cultured brahma!la or in a rich aristocratic family that will give one a 
further chance for elevation. That is the unique quality of work done in 
Kr�!la consciousness.

TRANSLATION 
Those who are on this path are resolute in purpose, and their aim is one. 
0 beloved child of the Kurus, the intelligence of those who are irresolute 
is many-branched. 
PURPORT 
A strong faith in Kr�!la consciousness that one should be elevated to the 
highest perfection of life is called vyavasiiyiitmikii intelligence. The 
Caitanya-caritiimrta states: 
'sraddhii '-sabde viSviisa kahe sudnlha niScaya 
knew bhakti kaile sarva-karma krta haya. 
Faith means unflinching trust in something sublime. When one is engaged 
in the duties of Kr�!!-a consciousness, he need not act in relationship to 
the material world with obligations to family traditions, humanity, or 
nationality. Fruitive activities are the engagements of one's reactions from 
past good or bad deeds. When one is awake in Kr�!!-a consciousness, he need 
no longer endeavor for good results in his activities. When one is situated in 
�pa consciousness, all activities are on the absolute plane, for they are 
no longer subject to dualities like good and bad. The highest perfection of 
�pa consciousness is renunciation of the material conception of life. 
This state is automatically achieved by progressive Kr�pa consciousness. 
The resolute purpose of a person in Kr�pa consciousness is based on 
I 
j 
126 
Bhagavad-gita As It Is 
[Ch. 2 . 
knowledge ("Vasudeva� sarvam iti sa mahatma sudurlabha� ") by which 
one comes to know perfectly that Vasudeva, or Kr��a, is the root of all 
manifested causes. As water on the root of a tree is automatically distrib­
uted to the leaves and branches, in Kn>Q.a consciousness, one can render 
the highest service to everyone-namely self, family, society, country, 
humanity, etc. If Kr�Q.a is satisfied by one's actions, then everyone will be 
satisfied. 
Service in Kr��a consciousness is, however, best practiced under the able 
guidance of a spiritual master who is a bona fide representative of Krwa, 
who knows the nature of the student and who can guide him to act in 
Kr��a consciousness. As such, to be well-versed in Kr�!la consciousness one 
has to act firmly and obey the representative of Kr��a, and one should 
accept the instruction of the bona fide spiritual master as one's mission 
in life. Srila Visvanatha Cakravarti Thakur instructs us, in his famous 
prayers for the spiritual master, as follows: 
yasya prasadad bhagavat-prasado 
yasyaprasadanna gati� kuto pi 
dhyayarit stuvarits tasya yasas tri-sandhyarit 
vande guro� sri-carararavindam. 
"By satisfaction of the spiritual master, the Supreme Personality of God­
head becomes satisfied. And by not satisfying the spiritual master, there 
is no chance of being promoted to the plane of Kr��a consciousness. I 
should, therefore, meditate and pray for his mercy three times a day, and 
offer my respectful obeisances unto him, my spiritual master." 
The whole process, however, depends on perfect knowledge of the soul 
beyond the conception of the body-not theoretically but practically, 
when there is no longer chance for sense gratification manifested in fruitive 
activities. One who is not firmly fixed in mind is diverted by various types 
of fruitive acts.

TRANSLATION 
Men of small knowledge are very much attached to the flowery words 
of the Vedas, which recommend various fruitive activities for elevation to 
heavenly planets, resultant good birth, power, and so forth. Being desirous 
of sense gratification and opulent life, they say that there is nothing more 
than this. 
' 
PURPORT 
People in general are not very intelligent, and due to their ignorance 
they are most attached to the fruitive activities recommended in the 
karma-kiirtfla portions of the Vedas. They do not want anything more than 
sense gratificatory proposals for enjoying life in heaven, where wine and 
women are available and material opulence is very common. In the Vedas 
many sacrifices are recommended for elevation to the heavenly planets, 
especially the jyoti§toma sacrifices. In fact, it is stated that anyone desiring 
elevation to heavenly planets must perform these sacrifices, and men with 
a poor fund of knowledge think that this is the whole purpose of Vedic 
wisdom. It is very difficult for such inexperienced persons to be situated 
'\ 
in the determined action of Kr�':la consciousness. As fools are attached to 
the flowers of poisonous trees without knowing the results of such attrac-

128 
Bhagavad-gita As It Is 
[Ch. 2 
tions, similarly unenlightened men are attracted by such heavenly opulence 
and the sense enjoyment thereof. 
In the karma-kiiru}a section of the Vedas it is said that those who 
perform the four monthly penances become eligible to drink the somarasa 
beverages to become immortal and happy forever. Even on this earth some 
are very eager to have somarasa to become strong and fit to enjoy sense 
gratifications. Such persons have no faith in liberation from material bond­
age, and they are very much attached to the pompous ceremonies of 
Vedic sacrifices. They are generally sensual, and they do not want anything 
other than the heavenly pleasures of life. It is understood that there are 
gardens called nandana-kiinana in which there is
-
good opportunity for 
association with angelic, beautiful women and having a profuse supply of 
somarasa wine. Such bodily happiness is certainly sensual; therefore there 
are those who are purely attached to material, temporary happiness, as 
lords of the material world.

for persons interested in material sense enjoyment, nor for those who are 
bewildered by such temporary things. They are more or less condemned by 
the process of material energy.

The. Vedas mainly deal with the subject of the three modes of material 
nature. Rise above these modes, 0 Arjuna. Be transcendental to all of 
them. Be free from all dualities and from all anxieties for gain and safety, 
and he established in the Self. 
PURPORT 
All material activities involve actions and reactions in the three modes 
of material nature. They are meant for fruitive results, which cause bond­
age in the material world. The Vedas deal mostly with fruitive activities to 
gradually elevate the general public from the field of sense gratification to 
a position on the transcendental plane. Arjuna, as a student and friend of, 
Lord Kr�!J.a, is advised to raise himself to the transcendental position of 
Vedanta philosophy where, in the beginning, there is brahma-jijiiasa, 
or questions on the Supreme Transcendence. All the living entities who are 
in the material world are struggling very hard for existence. For them the

Lord, after creation of the material world, gave the Vedic wisdom advising 
how to live and get rid of the material entanglement. When the activities 
for sense gratification, namely the karmackiiruJa chapter, are finished, then 
the chance for spiritual realization is offered in the form of the Upani§ads, 
which are part of different Vedas, as the Bhagavad-gitii is a part of the 
fifth Veda, namely the Mahiibhiirata. The Upani§ads mark the beginning 
of transcendental life. 
As long as the material body exists, there are actions and reactions in 
the material modes. One has to learn tolerance in the face of dualities such 
as happiness and distress, or cold and warmth, and by tolerating such 
dualities become free from anxieties regarding gain and loss. This transcen­
dental position is achieved in full Kr�l).a consciousness when one is fully 
dependent on the good will of Krwa.

PURPORT 
The rituals and sacrifices mentioned in the karma-kiifl-pa division of the 
Vedic literature are to encourage gradual development of self-realization. 
:' .,...

Text 46] 
Contents of the Gita Summarized 
131 
And the purpose of self-realization is clearly stated in the Fifteenth Chapter 
of the Bhagavad-gitii (15.15): the purpose of studying the Vedas is to 
know Lord Kr�!la. the primeval cause of everything. So, self-realization 
means understanding Kr�!la and one's eternal relationship with Him. The 
relationship of the living entities with Kr�!la is also mentioned in the 
Fifteenth Chapter of Bhagavad-gitii. The living entities are parts and parcels 
of Kr�!la; therefore, revival of Kr�!la consciousness by the individual 
living entity is the highest perfectional stage of Vedic knowledge. This is 
confirmed in the Srimad-Bhiigavatam (3.33. 7) as follows: 
aho bata svapaco'to gariyiin 
yaj-jihviigre vartate nama tubhyam 
tepus tapas te juhuvu� sasnur iirya 
brahmaniicur niima grrwnti ye te. 
"0 my Lord, a person who is chanting Your holy name, although born 
of a low family like that of a ciir4iila [dog eater], is situated on the highest 
platform of self-realization. Such a person must have performed all kinds 
of penances and sacrifices according to Vedic rituals and studied the 
Vedic literatures many, many times after taking his bath in all the holy 
places of pilgrimage. Such a person is considered to be th� best of the 
Aryan family." So one must be intelligent enough to understand the 
purpose of the Vedas, without being attached to the rituals only, and must 
not desire to be elevated to the heavenly kingdoms for a better quality of 
sense gratification. It is not possible for the common man in this age 
to follow all the rules and regulations of the Vedic rituals and the injunc­
tions of the Vedantas and the Upani§ads. It requires much time, energy, 
knowledge and resources to execute the purposes of the Vedas. This is 
hardly possible in this age. The best purpose of Vedic culture is served, 
however, by chanting the holy name of the Lord, as recommended by 
Lord Caitanya, the deliverer of all fallen souls. When Lord Caitanya was 
asked by a great Vedic scholar, Prakasananda Sarasvati, why He, the Lord, 
was chanting the holy name of the Lord like a sentimentalist instead of 
studying Vedanta philosophy, the Lord replied that His spiritual master 
found Him to be a great fool, and thus he asked Him to chant the holy 
name of Lord Kr�!la. He did so, and became ecstatic like a madman. In 
this age of Kali, most of the population is foolish and not adequately 
educated to under�tand Vedanta philosophy; the best purpose of Vedanta 
philosophy is served by inoffensively chanting the holy name of the Lord. 
Vedanta is the last word in Vedic wisdom, and the author and knower of 
the Vedanta philosophy is Lord Kr�!la; and the highest Vedantist is the

TRANSLATION 
You have a right to perform your prescribed duty, but you are not 
entitled to the fruits of action. Never consider yourself to be the cause of 
the results of your activities, and never be attached to not doing your duty. 
PURPORT 
There are three considerations here: prescribed duties, capricious work, 
and inaction. Prescribed duties refer to activities performed while one is in 
the modes of material nature. Capricious work means actions without the 
sanction of authority, and inaction means not performing one's prescribed 
duties. The Lord advised that Arjuna not be inactive, but that he perform 
his prescribed duty without being attached to the result. One who is 
attached to the result of his work is also the cause of the action. Thus he 
is the enjoyer or sufferer of the result of such actions. 
As far as prescribed duties are concerned, they can be fitted into three 
subdivisions, namely routine work, emergency work and desired activities. 
Routine work, in terms of the scriptural injunctions, is done without desire 
for results. As one has to do it, obligatory work is action in the mode of 
goodness. Work with results becomes the cause of bondage; therefore such 
Text 48] 
Contents of the Gita Summarized 
133 
work is not auspicious. Everyone has his proprietory right in regard to 
prescribed duties, but should act without attachment to the result; such 
disinterested obligatory duties doubtlessly lead one to the path of liberation. 
Arjuna was therefore advised by the Lord to fight as a matter of duty 
without attachment to the result. His nonparticipation in the battle is 
another side of attachment. Such attachment never leads one to the path 
of salvation. Any attachment, positive or negative, is cause for bondage. 
Inaction is sinful. Therefore, fighting as a matter of duty was the only 
auspicious path of salvation for Arjuna.

Be steadfast in yoga, 0 Arjuna. Perform your duty and abandon all

PURPORT 
Krwa tells Arjuna that he should act in yoga. And what is that yoga? 
Yoga means to concentrate the mind upon the Supreme by controlling the 
ever-disturbing senses. And who is the Supreme? The Supreme is the Lord. 
And because He Himself is telling Arjuna to fight, Arjuna has nothing to do 
with the results of the fight. Gain or victory are Kr�l).a's concern; Arjuna 
is simply advised to act according to the dictation of Kr�J).a. The following 
of Kr�l).a's dictation is real yoga, and this is practiced in the process called 
Kr�l).a consciousness. By Kr�l).a consciousness only can one give up the 
sense of proprietorship. One has to become the servant of Kr�l).a, or the

servant of the servant of Kr�J).a. That is the right way to discharge duty in 
Kr�l).a consciousness, which alone can help one to act in yoga. 
Arjuna is a k§atriya, and as such he is participating in the varr-iisrama­
dharma institution. It is said in the Vi�r-u Puriir-a that in the varr-asrama­
dharma, the whole aim is to satisfy Vi�pu. No one should satisfy himself, 
as is the rule in the material world, but one should satisfy Kr�pa. So, 
unless one satisfies Kr�pa, one cannot correctly observe the principles of 
varr-asrama-dharma. Indirectly, Arjuna was advised to act as Kr�pa told him.

PURPORT 
One who has actually come to understand one's constitutional position 
as the eternal servitor of the Lord gives up all engagements save working 
in Kf�l).a consciousness. As already explained, buddhi-yoga means transcen­
dental loving service to the Lord. Such devotional service is the right course 
of action for the living entity. Only misers desire to enjoy the fruit of 
their own work just to be further entangled in material bondage. Except 
for work in Krwa consciousness, all activities are abominable because

they continually bind the worker to the cycle of birth and death. One 
should therefore never desire to be the cause of work. Everything should 
be done in krsna consciousness for the satisfaction of Krsna. Misers do not

know how to utilize the assets of riches which they acquire by good

unfortunate persons do not employ their human energy in the service of 
the Lord.

A man engaged in devotional service rids himself of both good and bad 
actions even in this life. Therefore strive for yoga, 0 Arjuna, which is the 
art of all work. 
PURPORT 
Since time immemorial each living entity has accumulated the various 
reactions of his good and bad work. As such, he is continuously ignorant 
of his real constitutional position. One's ignorance can be removed by 
the instruction of the Bhagavad-gitii which teaches one to surrender unto 
Lord Sri Kf�pa in all respects and become liberated from the chained 
victimization of action and reaction, birth after birth. Arjuna is therefore 
advised to act in Kr�pa consciousness, the purifying process of resultant 
action.

TRANSLATION 
The wise, engaged in devotional service, take refuge in the Lord, and 
free themselves from the cycle of birth and death by renouncing the fruits 
of action in the material world. In this way they can attain that state 
beyond all miseries. 
PURPORT 
The liberated living_ entities seek that place where there are no material 
miseries. The Bhiigavatam says: 
samiisritii ye padapallava-plavam 
mahat-padam pur-ya-yaso muriirefl 
bhiivambudhir vatsa-padam param padam 
param padarh yad vipadiim na te�iim 
(Bhiig. 10.14.58) 
"For one who has accepted the boat of the lotus feet of the Lord, who is 
the shelter of the cosmic manifestation and is famous as Mukunda or the 
giver of mukti, the ocean of the material world is like the water contained 
in a calf's hoofprint.Param padam, or the place where there are no material 
miseries, or V aiku!J.tha, is his goal, not the place where there is danger in 
every step of life." 
Owing to ignorance, one does not know that this material world is a 
miserable place where there are dangers at every step. Out of ignorance 
only, less intelligent persons try to adjust to the situation by fruitive

activities, thinking that resultant actions will make them happy. They do 
not know that no kind of material body anywhere within the universe 
can give life without miseries. The miseries of life, namely birth, death, 
old age and diseases, are present everywhere within the material world. 
But one who understands his real constitutional position as the eternal 
servitor of the Lord, and thus knows the position of the Personality of 
Godhead, engages himself in the transcendental loving service of the Lord . 
. Consequently he becomes qualified to enter into the Vaiku�tha planets, 
where there is neither material, miserable life, nor the influence of time 
and death. To know one's constitutional position means to know also the 
sublime position of the Lord. One who wrongly thinks that the living 
entity's position and the Lord's position are on the same level is to be 
understood to be in darkness and therefore unable to engage himself in 
the devotional service of the Lord. He becomes a lord himself and thus 
paves the way for the repetition of birth and death. But one who, 
understanding that his position is to serve, transfers himself to the service 
of the Lord, at once becomes eligible for V aiku�thaloka. Service for the 
cause of the Lord is called karma-yoga or buddhi-_yoga, or in plain words, 
devotional service to the Lord.

Bhagavad-gita As It Is 
[Ch. 2. 
PURPORT 
There are many good examples in the lives of the great devotees of the 
Lord of those who became indifferent to the rituals of the Vedas simply 
by devotional service to the Lord. When a person factually understands 
Kr�l).a and his relationship with Kr�l).a, he naturally becomes completely 
indifferent to the rituals of fruitive activities, even though an experienced 
briihmarw. Sri Madhavendra Puri, a great devotee and iiciirya in the line of 
the devotees, says: 
sandhyii-vandana bhadram astu bhavato bhol;t sniina tubhyarh nama 
bho devab pitaras ca tarpara-vidhau niiharh k§amal;t k§amyatam 
yatra kviipi ni§adya yiidava-kulottamasya karhsa-dvi§ill;t 
smiirarh smiiram agharh hariimi tad alarh manye kim anyena me. 
"0 Lord, in my prayers three times a day, all glory to You. Bathing, I 
offer my obeisances unto You. 0 demigods! 0 forefathers! Please excuse 
me for my inability to offer you my respects. Now wherever I sit, I can 
remember the great descendant of the Y adu dynasty [ Kr�l).a), the enemy 
of Karhsa, and thereby I can free myself from all sinful bondage. I think 
this is sufficient for me." 
The Vedic rites and rituals are imperative for neophytes: comprehending 
all kinds of prayer three times a day, taking a bath early in the morning, 
offering respects to the forefathers, etc. But, when one is fully in Kf�l).a 
consciousness and is engaged in His transcendental loving service, one 
becomes indifferent to all these regulative principles because he has 
already attained perfection. If one can reach the platform of understanding 
by service to the Supreme Lord Kr�l).a, he has no longer to execute 
different types of penances and sacrifices as recommended in revealed 
scriptures. And, similarly, if one has not understood that the purpose 
of the Vedas is to reach Kf�l).a and simply engages in the rituals, etc., 
then he is uselessly wasting time in such engagements. Persons in Kr�l).a 
consciousness transcend the limit of sabda-brahma, or the range of the 
Vedas and Upani§ads.

A ��I].a conscious person, or unflinching devotee of the Lord, should not

One has only to carry out the orders of Kr�l)a or His 
representative, the spiritual master.

TRANSLATION 
Arjuna said: What are the symptoms of one whose consciousness is thus 
merged in Transcendence? How does he speak, and what is his language? 
How does he sit, and how does he walk? 
PURPORT 
As there are symptoms for each and every man, in terms of his particular 
situation, similarly one who is K��l'}a conscious has his particular nature­
talking, walking, thinking, feeling, etc. As a rich man has his symptoms by 
which he is known as a rich man, as a diseased man has his symptoms, by 
which he is known as diseased, or as a learned man has his symptoms, so a 
man in transcendental consciousness of ��l'}a has specific symptoms in 
various dealings. One can know his specific symptoms from the Bhagavad­
gitii. Most important is how the man in Kr��a consciousness speaks, for 
speech is the most important quality of any man. It is said that a fool is 
1mdiscovered as long as he does not speak, and certainly a well-dressed 
fool cannot be identified unless he speaks, but as soon as he speaks, he · 
reveals himself at once. The immediate symptom of a Kr��a conscious 
man is that he speaks only of Kr��a and of matters relating to Him. 
Other symptoms then automatically follow, as stated below.

TRANSLATION 
The Blessed Lord said: 0 Partha, when a man gives up all varieties of 
sense desire which arise from mental concoction, and when his mind finds 
satisfaction in the self alone, then he is said to be in pure transcendental 
consciousness. 
PURPORT 
The Bhiigavatam affirms that any person who is fully in Kr�!la conscious­
ness, or devotional service of the Lord, has all the good qualities of the 
great sages, whereas a person who is not so transcendentally situated has no 
good qualifications, because he is sure to be taking refug� in his own mental 
concoctions. Consequently, it is rightly said herein that one has to give up 
all kinds of sense desire manufactured by mental concoction. Artificially, 
such sense desires cannot be stopped. But if one is engaged in Kr�l)a con­
sciousness, then, automatically, sense desires subside without extraneous 
efforts. Therefore, one has to engage himself in Kr�l)a consciousness with­
out hesitation, for this devotional service will instantly help one on to the 
platform of transcendental consciousness. The highly developed soul 
always remains satisfied in himself by realizing himself as the eternal 
servitor of the Supreme Lord. Such a transcendentally situated person has 
no sense desires resulting from petty materialism; rather, he remains 
always happy in his natural position of eternally serving the Supreme Lord.

TRANSLATION 
One who is not disturbed in spite of the threefold miseries, who is not 
elated when there is happiness, and who is free from attachment, fear and 
anger, is called a sage of steady mind. 
PURPORT 
The word muni means one who can agitate his mind in various ways for 
mental speculation without coming to a factual conclusion. It is said that 
every muni has a different angle of vision, and unless a muni differs from 
other munis, he cannot be called a muni in the strict sense of the term. 
Nasau munir yasya matam na binnam. But a sthita-dhi-muni, as men­
tioned herein by the Lord, is different from an ordinary muni. The 
sthita-dhi-muni is always in Kr�J}a consciousness, fm he has exhausted 
all his business of creative speculation. He has surpassed the stage of 
mental speculations and has come to the conclusion that Lord Sri Krwa, 
or Vasudeva, is everything. He is called a muni fixed in mind. Such a fully 
Kr�pa conscious person is not at all disturbed by the onslaughts of the 
threefold miseries, for he accepts all miseries as the mercy of the Lord, 
thinking himself only worthy of more trouble due to his past misdeeds; 
and he sees that his miseries, by the grace of the Lord, are minimized to the 
lowest. Similarly, when he is happy he gives credit to the Lord, thinking 
himself unworthy of the happiness; he realizes that it is due only to the 
Lord's grace that he is in such a comfortable condition and able to render 
better service to the Lord. And, for the service of the Lord, he is always 
daring and active and is not influenced by attachment or aversion. Attach­
ment means accepting things for one's own sense gratification, and detach­
ment is the absence of such sensual attachment. But one fixed in Kr�J;la 
consciousness has neither attachment nor detachment because his life. is

dedicated in the service of the Lord. Consequently he is not at all angry 
even when his attempts are unsuccessful. A Kr�pa conscious person is 
always steady in his determination.

He who is without attachment, who does not rejoice when he obtains

There is always some upheaval in the material world which may be good 
or evil. One who is not agitated by such material upheavals, who is un­
affected by good and .evil, is to be understood to be fixed in Kr�pa 
consciousness. As long as one is in the material world there is alwaysthe 
possibility of good and evil because this world is full of duality. But one 
who is fixed in Kr�pa consciousness is not affected by good and evil 
because he is simply concerned with Kf�pa, who is all good absolute. Such 
consciousness in Kr�lJ.a situates one in a perfect transcendental position 
called, technically, samadhi.

One who is able to withdraw his senses from sense objects, as the 
tortoise draws his limbs within the shell, is to be understood as truly 
situated in knowledge. 
PURPORT 
The test of a yogi, devotee, or self-realized soul is that he is able to 
control the senses according to his plan. Most people, however, are 
servants of the senses and are thus directed by the dictation of the senses. 
That is the answer to the question as to how the yogi is situated. The 
senses are compared to venomous serpents. They want to act very 
loosely and without restriction. The yogt: or the devotee, must be very 
strong to control the serpents-like a snake charmer. He never allows them 
to act independently. There are many injunctions in the revealed scriptures; 
some of them are do-not's, and some of them are do's. Unless one is able 
to follow the do's and the do-not's, restricting oneself from sense enjoy­
ment, it is not possible to be firmly fixed in Kr�!la consciousness. The 
best example, set herein, is the tortoise. The tortoise can at any moment 
wind up his senses and exhibit them again at any time for particular 
purposes. Similarly, the senses of the Kr�!la conscious persons are used 
only for some particular purpose in the service of the Lord and are 
withdrawn otherwise. Keeping the senses always in the service of the 
Lord is the example set by the analogy of the tortoise, who keeps the 
senses within.

TRANSLATION 
The embodied soul may be restricted from sense enjoyment, though 
the taste for sense objects remains. But, ceasing such engagements by 
experiencing a higher taste, he is fixed in consciousness. 
PURPORT 
Unless one is transcendentally situated, it is not possible to cease from 
sense enjoyment. The process of restriction from sense enjoyment by rules 
and regulations is something like restricting a diseased person from certain 
types of eatables. The patient, however, neither likes such restrictions, nor 
loses his taste for eatables. Similarly, sense restriction by some spiritual 
process like a§fiinga-yoga, in the matter of yama, niyama, iisana, priipii­
yiima, pratyiihiira, dhararii, dhyiina, etc., is recommended for less intelli­
gent persons who have no better knowledge. But one who has tasted the 
beauty of the Supreme Lord Kr�J)a, in the course of his advancement in 
Kr�pa consciousness, no longer has a taste for dead material things. There­
fore, restrictions are there for the less intelligent neophytes in the spiritual 
advancement of life, but such restrictions are only good if one actually 
has a taste for Kr�pa consciousness. When one is actually Kr�pa conscious, 
he automatically loses his taste for pale things.

knowledge; indriyiiri-the senses; pramiithini-stimulated; haranti-throws

TRANSLATION 
The senses are so strong and impetuous, 0 Arjuna, that they forcibly 
carry away the mind even of a man of discrimination who is endeavoring 
to control them. 
PURPORT 
There are many learned sages; philosophers and transcendentalists who 
try to conquer the senses, but in spite of their endeavors, even the 
greatest of them sometimes fall victim to material sense enjoyment due to 
the agitated mind. Even Visvamitra, a great sage and perfect yogi, was mis­
led by Menaka into sex enjoyment, although the yogi was endeavoring for 
sense control with severe types of penance and yoga practice. And, of course, 
there are so many similar instances in the history of the world. Therefore, 
it is very difficult to control the mind and the senses without being fully 
Kr�Q.a conscious. Without engaging the mind in Kr�Q.a, one cannot cease 
such material engagements. A practical example is given by Sr1 Yamuna­
carya, a great saint and devotee, who says: "Since my mind has been 
engaged in the service of the lotus feet of Lord Kr�Q.a, and I have been en­
joying an ever new transcendental humor, whenever I think of sex life 
with a woman, my face at once turns from it, and I spit at the thought." 
Kr�Q.a consciousness is such a transcendentally nice thing that auto­
matically material enjoyment becomes distasteful. It is as if a hungry man 
had satisfied his hunger by a sufficient quantity of nutritious eatables. 
Maharaja Ambari�a also conquered a great yogi, Durvasa Muni, simply 
because his mind was engaged in Kr��a consciousness.

not at all possible to control the senses. As cited above, the great sage 
Durvasa Muni picked a quarrel with Maharaja Ambari�a, and Durvasa 
Muni unnecessarily became angry out of pride and therefore could not 
check his senses. On the other hand, the King, although not as powerful a 
yogi as the sage, but a devotee of the Lord, silently tolerated all the sage's 
injustices and thereby emerged victorious. The King was able to control 
his senses because of the following qualifications, as mentioned in the 
Srimad-Bhiigavatam:

"King Ambari�a fixed his mind on the lotus feet of Lord Kr�!la, engaged 
his words in describing the abode of the Lord, his hands in cleansing the 
temple of the Lord, his ears in hearing the pastimes of the Lord, his eyes 
in seeing the form of the Lord, his body in touching the body of the 
devotee, his nostrils in smelling the flavor of the flowers offered to the 
lotus feet of the Lord, his tongue in tasting the tulasi leaves offered to 
Him, his legs in traveling to the holy place where His temple is situated, 
his head in offering obeisances unto the Lord, and his desires in fulfilling 
the desires of the Lord ... and all these qualifications made him fit to 
become a mat-para{!. devotee of the Lord." (Bhiig. 9.4.18-20) 
The word mat-para[!. is most significant in this connection. How one, can 
become a mat-para[!. is described in the life of Maharaja Ambari�a. Sri:la 
Baladeva V idyabhu�a:r;ta, a great scholar and iiciirya in the line of the mat­
para{!., remarks: "mad-bhakti-prabhiivena sarvendriya-vijaya-piirvikii sviitma 
dnti{l. sulabheti bhiiva[!..,"' "The senses can be completely controlled 
only by the strength of devotional service to Kr�:r;ta." Also, the example of 
fire is sometimes given: "As the small flames within burn everything within 
the room, similarly Lord Vi�!lu, situated in the heart of the yogi, burns up 
all kinds of impurities." The Y oga-siitra also prescribes meditation on 
Vi�l)u, and not meditation on the void. The so-called yogis who meditate 
on something which is not the Vi�J)U form simply waste their time in a 
vain search after some phantasmagoria. We have to be ��J)a conscious­
devoted to the Personality of Godhead. This is the aim of the real yoga.

TRANSLATION 
While contemplating the objects of the senses, a person develops attach­
ment for them, and from such attachment lust develops, and from lust 
anger arises. 
. PURPORT 
One who is not KJ:�I].a conscious is subjected to material desires while 
contemplating the objects of senses. The senses require real engagements, 
and if they are not engaged in the transcendental loving service of the 
Lord, they will certainly seek engagement in the service of materialism. 
In the material world everyone, including Lord Siva and Lord Brahma-to 
say nothing of other demigods in the heavenly planets-is subjected to the 
influence of sense objects, and the only method to get out of this puzzle 
of material existence is to become K��I].a conscious. Lord Siva was deep in 
meditation, but when Parvafi agitated him for sense pleasure, he agreed to 
the proposal, and as a result i<.artikeya was born. When Haridasa Thakur 
was a young devotee of the Lord, he was similarly allured by the incarna­
tion of Maya Devi, but Haridasa easily passed the test because of his un­
alloyed devotion to Lord Kn;Q.a. As illustrated in the above-mentioned 
verse of Sri Yamunacarya, a sincere devotee of the Lord shuns all material 
sense enjoyment due to his higher taste for spiritual enjoyment in the asso­
ciation of the Lord. That is the secret of success. One who is not, therefore, 
in KJ:�I].a consciousness, however powerful he may be in controlling the 
senses by artificial repression, is sure ultimately to fail, for the slightest 
thought of sense pleasure will agitate him to gratify his desires.

falls down. 
TRANSJ.ATION 
From anger, delusion arises, and from delusion bewilderment of memory. 
When memory is bewildered , intelligence is lost, and when intelligence is 
lost, one falls down again into the material pool. 
PURPORT 
By development of K��!la consciousness one can know that everything 
has its use in the service of the Lord. Those who are without knowledge 
of K��J:}.a consciousness artificially try to avoid material objects, and as a 
result, although they desire liberation from material bondage, they do not 
attain to the perfect stage of renunciation. On the other hand, a person in 
K��J:}.a consciousness knows how to use everything in the service of the 
Lord; therefore he does not become a victim of material consciousness. 
For example, for an impersonalist, the Lord, or the Absolute, being 
impersonal, cannot eat. Whereas an impersonalist tries to avoid good 
eatables, a devotee knows that ��J:}.a is the supreme enjoyer and that He 
eats all that is offered to Him in devotion. So, after offering good 
eatables to the Lord, the devotee takes the remnants, called prasiidam. 
Thus everything becomes spiritualized and there is no danger of a down­
fall. The devotee takes prasiidam in ��J:}.a consciousness, whereas the 
nondevotee rejects it as material. The impersonalist, therefore, cannot 
enjoy life due to his artificial renunciation; and for this reason, a slight 
agitation of the mind pulls him down again into the pool of material 
existence. It is said that such a soul, even though rising up to the point of 
liberation, falls, down again due to his not having support in devotional 
serVIce.

TRANSLATION 
One who can control his senses by practicing the regulated principles of 
freedom can obtain the complete mercy of the Lord and thus become free 
from all attachment and aversion. 
PURPORT 
It is already explained that one may externally control the senses by 
some artificial process, but unless the senses are engaged in the transcen­
dental service of the Lord, there is every chance of a fall. Although the 
person in full Kr�JJ.a consciousness may apparently be on the sensual 
plane, because of his being Kr�I].a conscious, he has no attachment to 
sensual activities. The K!�I].a conscious person is concerned only with the 
satisfaction of K!�I].a, and nothing else. Therefore he is transcendental to 
all attachment. If K��I].a wants, the devotee can do anything which is 
ordinarily undesirable; and if Kr�I].a does not want, he shall not do that 
which he would have ordinarily done for his own satisfaction. Therefore 
to act or not to act is within his control because he acts only under the 
direction of K!�I].a. This consciousness is the causeless mercy of the Lord, 
which the devotee can achieve in spite of his being attached to the sensual 
platform.

PURPORT 
Unless one is in Kw:ta consciousness, there is no possibility of peace. So 
it is confirmed in the Fifth Chapter (5.29) that when one understands that 
Kr�I].a is the only enjoyer of all the good results of sacrifice and penance, 
and that He is the proprietor of all universal manifestations, that He is the 
real friend of all living entities, then only can one have real peace. There­
fore, if one is not in Kr�I].a consciousness, there cannot be a final goal for 
the mind. Disturbartce is due to want of an ultimate goal, and when one 
is certain that Kr�l].a is the enjoyer, proprietor and friend of everyone and 
everything, then one can, with a steady mind, bring about peace. There­
fore, one who is engaged without a relationship with Kr�l].a is certainly 
always in distress and is without peace, however much one may make a 
show of peace and spiritual advancement in life. ��I].a consciousness is a 
self-manifested peaceful condition which can be achieved only in relation­
ship with Kr�I].a.

practice this art under the guidance of a bona fide spiritual master-is 
called siidhaka, or a suitable candidate for liberation.

What is night for all beings is the time of awakening for the self- .

PURPORT 
There are two classes of intelligent men. The one is intelligent in material 
activities for sense gratification, and the other is introspective and awake 
to the cultivation of self-realization. Activities of the introspective sage, or 
thoughtful man, are night for persons materially absorbed. Materialistic 
persons remain asleep in such a night due to their ignorance of self­
realization. The introspective sage remains alert in the "night" of the ma­
terialistic men. The sage feels transcendental pleasure in the gradual ad­
vancement of spiritual culture, whereas the man in materialistic activities, 
being asleep to self-realization, dreams of varieties of sense pleasure, 
feeling sometimes happy and sometimes distressed in his sleeping con­
dition. The introspective man is always indifferent to materialistic happi- . 
ness and distress. He goes on with his self-realization activities undisturbed 
by material reaction.

TRANSLATION 
A person who is not disturbed by the incessant flow of desires-that 
enter like rivers into the ocean which is ever being filled but is always still­
can alone achieve peace, and not the man who strives to satisfy such desires. 
PURPORT 
Although the vast ocean is always filled with water, it is always, 
especially during the rainy season, being filled with much more water. But 
the ocean remains the same-steady; it is not agitated, nor does it cross 
beyond the limit of its brink. That is also true of a person fixed in Kr�!la 
consciousness. As long as one has the material body, the demands of the 
body for sense gratification will continue. The devotee, however, is not 
disturbed by such desires because of his fullness. A Kr�!la conscious man 
is not in need of anything because the Lord fulfills all his material 
necessities. Therefore he is like the ocean-always full in himself. Desires 
may come to him like the waters of the rivers that flow into the ocean, but 
he is steady in his activities, and he is not even slightly disturbed by 
desires for sense gratification. That is the proof of a Kr�I).a conscious man­
one who has lost all inclinations for material sense gratification, although 
the desires are present. Because he remains satisfied in the transcendental 
loving service of the Lord, he can remain steady, like the ocean, and 
therefore enjoy full peace. Others, however, who fulfill desires even up 
to the limit of liberation, what to speak of material success, never attain 
peace. The fruitive workers, the salvationists, and also the yogis who are 
after mystic powers, are all unhappy because of unfulfilled desires. But 
the person in Kr�!!a consciousness is happy in the service of the Lord, and 
he has no desires to be fulfilled. In fact, he does not even desire liberation 
from the so-called material bondage. The devotees of Kr�!la have no 
material desires, and therefore they are in perfect peace.

TRANSLATION 
A person who has given up all desires for sense gratification, who lives 
free from desires, who has given up all sense of proprietorship and is devoid 
of false ego-he alone can attain real peace. 
PURPORT 
To become desireless means not to desire anything for sense gratification. 
In other words, desire for becoming Kr�tJ.a conscious is actually desireless­
ness. To understand one's actual position as the eternal servitor of Kr�tJ.a, 
without falsely claiming this material body to be oneself and without 
falsely claiming proprietorship over anything in the world, is the perfect 
stage of Kr�tla consciousness. One who is situated in this perfect stage 
knows that because Kr�tla is the proprietor of everything, therefore every: 
thing must be used for the satisfaction of Kr�tJ.a. Arjuna did not want to 
fight for his own sense satisfaction, but when he became fully Kr�tJ.a 
conscious he fought because Kr�tJ.a wanted him to fight. For himself there 
was no desire to fight, but for Kr�tJ.a the same Arjuna fought to his best 
ability. Desire for the satisfaction of Kr�tJ.a is really desirelessness; it is 
not an artificial attempt to abolish desires. The living entity cannot be 
desireless or senseless, but he does have to change the quality of the 
desires. A materially desireless person certainly knows that everything 
belongs to .Kr�tJ.a (isiiviisyam idarh sarvam), and therefore he does not 
falsely claim proprietorship over anything. This transcendental knowledge 
is based. on self-realization-namely, knowing perfectly well that every

living entity is the eternal part and parcel of Kr�Qa in spiritual identity, and 
therefore the eternal position of the living entity is never on the level of 
Kr�!1a or greater than Him. This understanding of Kr�!1a consciousness is 
the basic principle of real peace.

That is the way of the spiritual and godly life, after attaining which a 
man is not bewildered. Being so situated, even at the hour of death, one 
can enter into the kingdom of God. 
PURPORT 
One can attain Kr�!1a consciousness or divine life at once, within a 
second-or one may not attain such a state of life even after millions of 
births. It is only a matter of understanding and accepting the fact. 
Khatvanga Maharaja attained this state of life just a few minutes before his 
death, by surrendering unto Kr�!1a. Nirvar-a means ending the process of 
materialistic life. According to Buddhist philosophy, there is only void 
after the completion of this material life, but Bhagavad-gita teaches 
differently. Actual life begins after the completion of this material life. 
For the gross materialist it is sufficient to know that one has to end this 
materialistic way of life, but for persons who are spiritually advanced, 
there is another life after this materialistic life. Before ending this life, 
if one fortunately becomes Kr�!1a conscious, he at once attains the stage

of Brahma-nirviirw. There is no difference between the kingdom of God 
and the devotional service of the Lord. Since both of them are on the 
absolute plane, to be engaged in the transcendental loving service of the 
Lord is to have attained the spiritual kingdom. In the material world there 
are activities of sense gratification, whereas in the spiritual world there are 
activities of Kr�!la consciousness. Attainment of Kr�!la consciousness even 
during this life is immediate attainment of Brahman, and one who is 
situated in Kr�!la consciousness has certainly already entered into the 
kingdom of God. 
Brahman is just the opposite of matter. Therefore briihmi sthiti[l means 
"not on the platform of material activities." Devotional service of the Lord 
is accepted in the Bhagavad-gitii as the liberated stage. Therefore, brahmT­
sthiti[l is liberation from material bondage. 
Srila Bhaktivinode Thakur has summarized this Second Chapter of the 
Bhagavad-gitii as being the contents for the whole text. In the Bhagavad­
gitii, the subject matters are karma-yoga, jiiiina-yoga, and bhakti-yoga. In 
the Second Chapter karma-yoga and jiiiina-yoga have been clearly discuss­
ed, and a glimpse of bhakti-yoga has also been given, as the contents for 
the complete text. 
Thus end the Bhaktivedanta Purports to the Second Chapter of the 
Srimad-Bhagavad-gita in the matter of its Contents.

Arjnna said: 0 Janardana, 0 Kesava, why do You urge me to engage in

work? 
PURPORT 
The Supreme Personality of Godhead Sri Kr�J).a has very elaborately 
described the constitution of the soul in the previous chapter, with a view 
to deliver His intimate friend Arjuna from the ocean of material grief. And 
the path of realization has been recommended: buddhi"yoga, or Kr�J).a 
consciousness. Sometimes Kr�J).a consciousness is misunderstood to be 
inertia, and one with such a misunderstanding often withdraws to a se­
cluded place to become fully Kr�J).a conscious by chanting the holy name 
of Lord Kr�J).a. But without being trained in the philosophy of Kr�J).a 
· consciousness, it is not advisable to chant the holy name of Kr�J).a in a 
secluded place where one may acquire only cheap adoration from the 
innocent public. Arjuna also thought of Kr�J).a consciousness or buddhi­
yoga, or intelligence in spiritual advancement of knowledge, as something 
like retirement from active life and the practice of penance and austerity 
at a secluded place. In other words, he wanted to skillfully avoid the fight­
ing by using Kr�J).a consciousness as an excuse. But as a sincere student, he 
placed the matter before his master and questioned Kr�J).a as to his best 
course of action. In answer, Lord Kr�J).a elaborately explained karma-yoga,

PURPORT 
In the previous chapter, as a prelude to theBhagavad-gitii, many different 
paths were explained, such as siinkhya-yoga, buddhi-yoga, control of the 
senses by intelligence, work without fruitive desire, and the position of the 
neophyte. This was all presented unsystematically. A more organized out­
line of the path would be necessary for action and understanding. Arjuna, 
therefore, wanted to clear up these apparently confusing matters so that 
any common man could accept them without misinterpretation. Although 
Kr�J).a had no intention of confusing Arjuna by any jugglery of words, 
Arjuna could not follow the process of Kr�J).a consciousness-either by 
inertia or active service. In other words, by his questions he is clearing the 
path of Kr�J).a consciousness for all students who seriously want to under­
stand the mystery of the Bhagavad-gitii.

TRANSLATION 
The Blessed Lord said: 0 sinless Arjuna, I have ;tlready explained that 
there are two classes of men who realize the Self. Some are inclined to 
understand Him by empirical, philosophical speculation, and others are 
inclined to know Him by devotional work. 
PURPORT 
In the Second Chapter, verse 39, the Lord explained two kinds of 
procedures -namely siinkhya-yoga and karma-yoga, or buddhi-yoga. In this 
verse, the Lord explains the same more clearly. Siihkhya-yoga, or the 
analytical study of the nature of spirit and matter, is the subject matter for 
persons who are inclined to speculate-and understand things by experimen­
tal knowledge and philosophy. The other class of men work in Kr�va 
consciousness, as it is explained in the 6Ist verse of the Second Chapter. 
The Lord has explained, also in the 39th verse, that by working by the 
principles of buddhi-yoga, or Kr�va consciousness, one can be relieved from 
the bonds of action; and, furthermore, there is no flaw in the process. The 
same principle is more clearly explained in the 6lst verse-that this buddhi­
yoga is to depend entirely on the Supreme (or more specifically, on 
Kr�va), and in this way all the senses can be brought under control very 
easily. Therefore, both the yogas are interdependent, as religion and 
philosophy. Religion without philosophy is sentiment, or sometimes fanati­
cism, while philosophy without religion is mental speculation. The ultimate 
goal is Kr�va, because the philosophers who are also sincerely searching 
after the Absolute Truth come in the end to Kr�va consciousness. This is 
also stated in the Bhagavad-gitii. The whole process is to understand the 
real position of the self in relation to the Superself. The indirect process 
is philosophical speculation, by which, gradually, one may come to the 
point of Kr�va consciousness; and the other process is directly connecting 
with everything in Kr�va consciousness. Of these two, the path of Kr�va 
consciousness is better because it does not depend on purifying the senses 
by a philosophical process. Kr�va consciousness is itself the purifying 
process, and by the direct method of devotional service it is simultaneously 
easy and sublime.

TRANSLATION 
Not by merely abstaining from work can one achieve freedom from 
reaction, nor by renunciation alone can one attain perfection. 
PURPORT 
The renounced order of life can be accepted upon being purified by the 
discharge of the prescribed form of duties which are laid down just to 
purify the heart of materialistic men. Without purification, one cannot 
attain success by abruptly adopting the fourth order of life (sannyiisa). 
According to the empirical philosophers, simply by adopting sannyiisa, or 
retiring from fruitive activities, one at once becomes as good as Niiriiyava. 
But Lord Krwa does not approve this principle. Without purificatio·n of 
heart, sannyiisa is simply a disturbance to the social order. On the other 
hand, if someone takes to the transcendental service of the Lord, even 
without discharging his prescribed duties, whatever he may be able to ad­
vance in the cause is accepted by the Lord (buddhi-yoga ). Svalpa;m apy asya 
dhannasya triiyate mahato bhayiit. Even a slight performance of such a 
principle enables one to overcome great difficulties.

TRANSLATION 
All men are forced to act helplessly according to the impulses born of 
the modes of material nature; therefore no one can refrain from doing 
something, not even for a moment. 
PURPORT 
It is not a question of embodied life, but it is the nature of the soul to 
be always active. Without the presence of the spirit soul, the material body 
cannot move. The body is only a dead vehicle to be worked by the spirit 
soul, which is always active and cannot stop even for a moment. As such, 
the spirit soul has to be engaged in the good work of Kr�va consciousness, 
otherwise it will be engaged in occupations dictated by illusory energy. In 
contact with material energy, the spirit soul acquires material modes, and 
to purify the soul from such affinities it is necessary to engage in the 
prescribed duties enjoined in the siistras. But if the soul is engaged in his 
natural function of Krwa consciousness, whatever he is able to do is good 
for him. The Srimad-Bhiigavatam affirms this: 
tyaktvii sva-dharmam carariimbujam harer 
bhajann apakvo 'tha patet tato yadi 
yatra kva viibhadram abhiid amu�ya kim 
ko viirtha iipto 'bhajatiim sva-dharmata�. 
"If someone takes to Kr��ta consciousness, even though he may not 
follow the prescribed duties in the siistras nor execute the devotional service 
properly, and even though he may fall down from the standard, there is no 
loss or evil for him. But if he carries out all the injunctions for purification 
in the siistras, what does it avail him if he is not Kr�va conscious?" (Bhiig. 
'Text 6] 
Karrna-yoga 
167 
1.5.17) So the purificatory process is necessary for reaching this point of 
Kr�r;ta consciousness. Therefore, sannyiisa, or any purificatory process, is 
to help reach the ultimate goal of becoming Kr�r;ta conscious, without 
which everything is considered a failure.

TRANSLATION 
One who restrains the senses and organs of action, hut whose mind 
dwells on sense objects, certainly deludes himself and is called a pretender. 
PURPORT 
There are many pretenders who refuse to work in Krwa consciousness 
but make a show of meditation, while actually dwelling within the mind 
upon sense enjoyment. Such pretenders may also speak on dry philosophy 
in order to bluff sophisticated followers, but according to this verse these 
are the greatest cheaters. For sense enjoyment one can act in any capacity 
of the social order, but if one follows the rules and regulations of his 
particular status, he can make gradual progress in purifying his existence. 
But he who makes a show of being a yogi, while actually searching for the 
objects of sense gratification, must be called the greatest cheater, even though 
he sometimes speaks of philosophy. His knowledge has no value because 
the effects of such a sinful man's knowledge are taken away by the illusory 
energy of the Lord. Such a pretender's mind is always impure, and there­
fore his 'show of yogic meditation has no value whatsoever.

On the other hand, he who controls the senses by the mind and engages

PURPORT 
Instead of becoming a pseudo-transcendentalist for the sake of wanton 
living and sense enjoyment, it is far better to remain in one's own business 
and execute the purpose of life, which is to get free from material bondage 
and enter into the kingdom of God. The prime sviirtha-gat� or goal of self­
interest, is to reach Vi�Q.U. The whole institution of varp.a and iisrama is 
designed to help us reach this goal of life. A householder can also reach 
this destination by regulated service in Kr�Q.a consciousness. For self­
realization, one can live a controlled life, as prescribed in the siistras, and 
continue carrying out his business w}thout attachment, and in that way 
make progress. Such a sincere person who follows this method is far better 
situated than the false pretender who adopts show-bottle spiritualism to 
cheat the innocent public. A sincere sweeper in the street is far better than 
the charlatan meditator who meditates only for the sake of making a living.

TRANSLATION 
Perform your prescribed duty, for action is better than inaction. A man 
cannot even maintain his physical body without work. 
PURPORT 
There are many pseudo-meditators who misrepresent themselves as 
belonging to high parentage, and great professional men who falsely pose 
that they have sacrificed everything for the sake of advancement in spiri­
tual life. Lord Kr�JJ.a did not want Arjuna to become a pretender, but that 
he perform his prescribed duties as set forth for k�atriyas. Arjuna was a 
householder and a military general, and therefore it was better for him to 
remain as such and perform his religious duties 
as prescribed for the 
householder k�atriya. Such activities gradually cleanse the heart of a 
mundane man and free him from material contamination. So-called renun­
ciation for the purpose of maintenance is never approved by the Lord, nor 
by any religious ·scripture. After all, one has to maintain one's body and 
soul together by some work. Work should not be given up capriciously, 
without purification of materialistic propensities. Anyone who is in the 
material world is certainly possessed of the impure propensity for lording 
it over material nature, or, in other words, for sense gratification. Such 
170 
Bhagavad-gitii As It Is 
rch. 3. 
polluted propensities have to be cleared. Without doing so, through 
prescribed duties, one should never attempt to become a so-called tran­
scendentalist, renouncing work and living at the cost of others.

Work done as a sacrifice for Vi�J.lU has to be performed, otherwise work 
binds one to this material world. Therefore, 0 son of Kunti, perform your 
prescribed duties for His satisfaction, and in that way you will always 
remain unattached and free from bondage. 
PURPORT 
Since one has to work even for the simple maintenance of the body,. the 
prescribed duties for a particular social position and quality are so made 
that that purpose can be fulfilled. Y ajiia means Lord 'V igm, or sacrificial 
performances. All sacrificial performances also are meant for the satisfac­
tion of Lord Vi�J.lU. The Vedas enjoin: yajiio vai vi§flu�. In other words, 
the same purpose is served whether one performs prescribed yajiias or 
directly serves Lord Vi�J.lu. Kr�J.la consciousness is therefore performance 
of yajiia as it is prescribed in this verse. The varp.iisrama institution also 
aims at this for satisfying Lord Vi�J.lU. "Varp.iiSramiiciira-vatii puru§e!la

sciousness to satisfy Kr�r;ta (or Vi��;m); and while performing such activities 
one is in a liberated stage. This is the great art of doing work, and in the 
beginning this process requires very expert guidance. One should therefore 
act very diligently, under the expert guidance of a devotee of Lord Kr�Q.a, 
or under the direct instruction of Lord Kr�Q.a Himself (under whom Arjuna 
had the opportunity to work). Nothing should be performed for sense 
gratification, hut everything should he done for the satisfaction of Kr�Q.a. 
This practice will not only save one from the reaction of work, hut will 
also gradually elevate one to transcendental loving service of the Lord, 
which alone can raise one to the kingdom of God.

In the beginning of creation, the Lord of all creatures sent forth genera­

them by saying, "Be thou happy by this yajiia [sacrifice] because its 
performance will bestow upon you all desirable things." 
l 
172 
Bhagavad-gita As It Is 
[Ch. 3. 
PURPORT 
The material creation by the Lord of creatures (Vi��m) is a chance 
offered to the conditioned souls to come back home-back to Godhead. 
All living entities within the material creation are conditioned by material 
nature because of their forgetfulness of their relationship to Kr�pa, the 
Supreme Personality of Godhead_ The Vedic principles are to help us 
understand this eternal relation as it is stated in the Bhagavad-gitii: vedaiS 
ca sarvair aham eva vedya�. The Lord says that the purpose of the Vedas 
is to understand Him. In the Vedic hymns it is said: patim visvasyiitmes­
varam Therefore, the Lord of the living entities is the Supreme Personality 
of Godhead, Vi�pu. In the Srimad-Bhiigavatam also Srila Sukadeva Gosvami 
describes the Lord as pati in so many ways: 
sriy�-patir yajfia-pati� prajii-patir 
dhiyiim patir loka-patir dharii-pati� 
patir gatiS ciindhaka-vnr-i-siitvatiim 
prasidatiim me bhagaviin satiim pati� 
(Bhiig. 2.4.20) 
The prajii-pati is Lord Vi�QU, and He is the Lord of all living creatures, 
all worlds, and all beauties, and the protector of everyone. The Lord 
created this material world for the conditioned souls to learn how to 
perform yajfias (sacrifice) for the satisfaction of V�pu, so that while in the 
material world they can live very comfortably without anxiety. Then after 
finishing the present material body, they can enter into the kingdom of 
God. That is the whole program for the conditioned soul. By performance 
of yajfia, the conditioned souls gradually become Kr�-pa conscious and 
become godly in all respects. In this age of Kali, the sankirtana-yajfia (the 
chanting of the names of God) is recommended by the Vedic scriptures, 
and this transcendental system was introduced by Lord Caitanya for the 
deliverance of all men in this age. Sankirtana,yajfia and Krwa conscious­
ness go well together. Lord K�-pa inHisdevotional form (as Lord Caitanya) 
is mentioned in the Srimad-Bhiigavatam as follows, with special reference 
to the sail.kirtana-yajfia: 
kHr-a-varr-am tvi§aknr-am sangopiihgiistra-piir§adam

will worship the Lord, who is accompanied by His associates, by perform­
ance of sankirtana-yajfia." (Bhiig. 11.5.29) Other yajfias prescribed in the 
Vedic literatures are not easy to perform in this age of Kali, but the 
sankirtana-yajna is easy and .sublime for all purposes.

The demigods, being pleased by sacrifices, will also please you; thus

PURPORT 
The demigods are empowered administrators of material affairs. The 
supply of air, light, water and all other benedictions for maintaining the 
body and soul of every living entity are entrusted to the demigods, who 
are innumerable assistants in different parts of the body of the Supreme 
Personality of Godhead. Their pleasures and displeasures are dependent on 
the performance of yajfias by the human being. Some of the yajfias are 
meant to satisfy particular demigods; but even in so doing, Lord Vi��u is 
worshiped in all yajfias as the chief beneficiary. It is stated also in the 
Bhagavad-gitii that Kr��a Himself is the beneficiary of all kinds of yajfias: 
bhoktiiram yajfia-tapasiim. Therefore, ultimate satisfaction of the yajfia­
pati is the chief purpose of all yajfias. When these yajfias are perfectly

[Ch. 3 
performed, naturally the demigods in charge of the different departments 
of supply are pleased, and there is no scarcity in the supply of natural 
products. 
Performance of yajiias has many side benefits, ultimately leading to 
liberation from the material bondage. By performance of yajiias, all activi­
ties become purified, as it is stated in the Vedas: 
iihiira-suddhau sattva-suddhi/1 sattva-suddhau 
dhmvii smrtip smrti-lambhe saroa-granthiniim vipra-mokfap 
As it will be explained in the following verse, by performance of yajiia, 
one's eatables become sanctified, and by eating sanctified foodstuffs, one's 
very existence becomes purified; by the purification of existence, finer 
tissues in the memory become sanctified, and when memory is sanctified, 
one can think of the path of liberation, and all these combined together 
lead to KnJ;J.a consciousness, the great necesstty of present-day society.

Karma-yoga 
175 
PURPORT 
The demigods are authorized supplying agents on behalf of the Supreme 
Personality of Godhead, Vi�pu. Therefore, they must be satisfied by the 
performance of prescribed yajfias. In the Vedas, there are different kinds 
of yajfias prescribed for different kinds of demigods, but all are ultimately 
offered to the Supreme Personality of Godhead. For one who cannot 
understand what the Personality of Godhead is, sacrifice to the demigods 
is recommended. According to the different material qualities of the 
persons concerned, different types of yajfias are recommended in the 
·Vedas. Worship of different demigods is also on the same basis-namely, 
according to different qualities. For example, the meat-eaters are recom· 
mended to worship the goddess Kali, the ghastly form of material nature, 
and before the goddess the Racrifice of animals is recommended. But for 
those who are in the mode of goodness, the transcendental worship of 
Vi�pu is recommended. But ultimately, all ya.jfias are meant for gradual 
promotion to the transcendental position. For ordinary men, at least fiv� 
yajfias, known as pafica-mahiiyajfia, are necessary. 
One should know, however, that all the necessities of life that the human 
society requires are supplied by the demigod agents of the Lord. No one 
can manufacture anything. Take, for example, all the eatables of human 
society. These eatables include grains, fruits, vegetables, milk, sugar, et�., 
for the persons in the mode of goodness, and also eatables for the non­
vegetarians, like meats, etc., none of which can be manufactured by men. 
Then again, take for example heat, light, water, air, etc., which are also 
necessities of life-none of them can be manufactured by the human 
society. Without the Supreme Lord, there can be no profuse sunlight, 
moonlight, rainfall, breeze, etc., without which no one can live. Obviously, 
our life is dependent on supplies from the Lord. Even for our manufac­
turing enterprises, we require so many raw materials like metal, sulphur, 
mercury, manganese, and so many essentials-all of which are supplied _by 
the agents of the Lord, with the purpose that we should make proper use ' 
of them to keep ourselves fit and healthy for the purpose of selhealization, 
leading to the ultimate goal of life, namely, liberation from the material 
struggle for existence. This aim of life is attained by performance of yajfias. 
If we forget the purpose of human life and simply take supplies from the 
agents of the Lord for sense gratification and become more and more 
- -entangled in material existence, which is not the purpose of creation, 
certainly we become thieves, and therefore we are punishea by the laws of 
material nature. A society of thieves can never be happy because they have

no aim in life. The gross materialist thieves have no ultimate goal of life. 
They are simply directed to sense gra tification; nor do they ha_veknowledge 
of how to perform yajiias. Lord Caitanya, however, inaugurated the easiest 
performance of yajiia, naD,flY the sankirtana-yajiia, which can be per­
formed by anyone in the world who accepts the principles of Kr�pa con­
sciOusness.

The devotees of the. Lord are released from all kinds of sins because they

personal sense enjoyment, verily eat only sin. 
PURPORT 
The devotees of the Supreme Lord, or the persons who are in K�pa con­
sciousness, are calledsantas, and they are always in love with the Lord as it 
is described in the Brahma-samhitii: premiiiijana-cchurita-bhakti-vilocanena 
santa[!, sadaiva hrdaye§u vilokayanti. The santas, being always in a compact 
of love with the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Govinda (the giver of 
all pleasures), or Mukunda (the giver of liberation), or Kr�pa (the all­
attractive person), cannot accept anything without first offering it to the 
Supreme Person. Therefore, such devotees always perform yajiias in differ-

ent modes of devotional service, such as sravapam, kirtanam, smarapam, 
arcanam, etc., and these performances of yajiias keep them always aloof 
from all kinds of contamin.on of sinful association in the material world. 
Others, who prepare food for self or sense gratification, are not only 
thieves, but are also the eaters of all kinds of sins. How can a person be 
happy if he is both a thief and sinful? It is not possible. Therefore, in order 
for people to become happy in all respects, they must be taught to per­
form the easy process of sankirtana-yajiia, in full Kpgta consciousness. 
Otherwise, there can be no peace or happiness in the world.

Bhagavad-gita As It Is 
[Ch. 3 
Lord, who is known as the yajiia-puru�ap, or the personal beneficiary of 
all sacrifices, is the master of all demigods who serve Him as the different 
limbs of the body serve the whole. Demigods like Indra, Candra, V arul)a, 
etc., are appointed officers who manage material affairs, and the Vedas 
direct sacrifices to satisfy these demigods so that they may be pleased to 
supply air, light and water sufficiently to produce food grains. When Lord 
Knl)a is worshiped, the demigods, who are different limbs of the Lord, 
are also automatically worshiped; therefore there is no separate need to 
worship the demigods. For this reason, the devotees of the Lord, who are 
in Kr�l)a consciousness, offer food to KJi(ul and then eat-a process which 
nourishes the body spiritually. By such action not only are past sinful 
reactions in the body vanquished, but the body becomes immunized to all 
contamination of material nature. When there is an epidemic disease, an 
antiseptic vaccine protects a person from the attack of such an epidemic. 
Similarly, food offered to Lord Vi�I)U and then taken by us makes us 
sufficiently resistant to material affection, and one who is accustomed to 
this practice is called a devotee of the Lord. Therefore, a person in Kr��a 
consciousness, who eats only food offered to Krwa, can counteract all 
reactions of past material infections, which are impediments to the progress 
of self-realization. On the other hand, one who does not do so continues 
to increase the volume of sinful action, and this prepares the next body to 
resemble hogs and dogs, to suffer the resultant reactions of all sins. The 
material world is full of contaminations, and one who is immunized by 
accepting prasiidam of the Lord (food offered to Vi��u) is saved 
from the attack, whereas one who does not do so becomes subjected 
to contamination. 
Food grains or vegetables are factually eatables. The human being eats 
different kinds of food grains, vegetables, fruits, etc., and the animals eat 
the refuse of the food grains and vegetables, grass, plants, etc. Human 
beings who are accustomed to eating meat and flesh must also depend on 
the production of vegetation in order to eat the animals. Therefore, ulti­
mately, we have to depend on the production of the field and not on the 
_,_. production of big factories. The field production is due to sufficient rain 
from the ·sky, and such rains are controlled by demigods like Indra, sun, 
moon, etc., and they are all servants of the Lord. The Lord can be satisfied 
by sacrifices; therefore, one who cannot perform them will find himself in 
scarcity-that is the law of nature. Yajna, specifically the sankirtana-yajna 
prescribed for this age, must therefore be performed to save us at least 
from scarcity of food supply .

TRANSLATION 
Regulated activities are prescribed in the Vedas, and the Vedas are 
directly manifested from the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Con­
sequently the all-pervading Transcendence is eternally situated in acts 
of sacrifice. 
PURPORT 
Y ajiiartha karma, or the necessity of work for the satisfaction of Kr�pa 
only, is more expressly stated in this verse. If we have to work for the 
satisfaction of the yajiia-puru§a, V�pu, then we must find out the direction 
of work in Brahman, or the transcendental Vedas. The Vedas are therefore 
codes of working directions. Anything performed without the direction of 
the Vedas is called vikarma, or unauthorized or sinful work. Therefore, 
one should always take direction from the Vedas to be saved from the 
reaction of work. As one has to work in ordinary life by the direction of 
the state, similarly, one has to work under direction of the supreme state 
of the Lord. Such directions in the Vedas are directly manifested from the 
breathing of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. It is said: asya mahato 
bhiltasya na.Svasitam etad yad rg-vedo yajur-vedap sama-vedo 'tharvan 
girasap. "The four Vedas-namely the .(tg-veda, Y ajur-veda, Sama-veda and 
A tharva�veda-are all emanations from the breathing of the great Person­
ality of Godhead." The Lord, being omnipotent, can speak by breathing 
��-

[Ch. 3 
air, as it is confirmed in the Brahma-samhitii, for the Lord has the omnipo­
tence to perform through each of His senses the actions of all other senses. 
In other words, the Lord can speak through His breathing, and He can 
impregnate by His eyes. In fact, it is said that He glanced over material 
nature and thus fathered all living entities. After creating or impregnating 
r 
the conditioned souls into the womb of material nature, He gave His 
directions in the Vedic wisdom as to how su<;R conditioned souls can 
return home, back to Godhead. We should always remember that the con­
ditioned souls in material nature are all eager for material enjoyment. But 
the Vedic directions are so made that one can satisfy one's perverted 
desires, then return to Godhead, having finished his so-called enjoyment. It 
is a chance for the conditioned souls to attain liberation; therefore the 
conditioned souls must try to follow the process of yajna by becoming 
Kr�pa conscious. Even those who cannot follow the Vedic injunctions may 
adopt the principles of Kr�pa consciousness, and that will take the place of 
performance of Vedic yajnas, or karmas.

181 
PURPORT 
The mammonist philosophy of work very hard and enjoy sense gratifica­
tion is condemned herein by the Lord. Therefore, for those who want to 
enjoy this material world, the above-mentioned wcle of performing yajnas 
' 
is absolutely necessary. One who does not follow such regulations is living 
a very risky life, being condemned more and more. By nature's law, this 
human form of life is specifically meant for self-realization, in either of the 
three ways-namely karma-yoga, jniina-yoga, or bhakti-yoga. There is no 
necessity of rigidly following the performances of the prescribed yajnas 
for the transcendentalists who are above vice and virtue; but those who are 
engaged in sense gratification require purification by the above-mentioned 
cycle of yajna performances. There are different kinds of activities. Those 
who are not Kr�pa conscious are certainly engaged in sensory conscious­
ness; therefore they need to execute pious work. The yajna system is 
planned in such a way that sensory conscious persons may satisfy their 
desires without becoming entangled in the reaction of sense-gratificatory 
work. The prosperity of the world depends not on our own efforts but on 
the background arrangement of the Supreme Lord, directly carried out by 
the demigods. Therefore, the yajnas are directly aimed at the particular 
demigod mentioned in the Vedas. Indirectly, it is the practice of Kr�pa 
consciousness, because when one masters the performance of yajnas, one 
is sure to become Kr�pa conscious. But if by performing yajnas one does 
not become Kr�pa conscious, such principles are counted as only moral 
codes. One should not, therefore, limit his progress only to the point of 
moral codes, but should transcend them, to attain Kr�pa consciousness.

One who is, however, taking pleasure in the self, who is illumined in the

A person who is fully Kr�J;Ia conscious, and is fully satisfied by his acts 
in Kr�J;Ia consciousness, no longer has any duty to perform. Due to his 
being Kr�J;Ia conscious, all impiety within is instantly cleansed, an effect of 
many, many thousands of yajiia performances. By such clearing of con­
sciousness, one becomes fully confident of his eternal position in relation­
ship with the Supreme. His duty thus becomes self-illuminated by the 
grace of the Lord, and therefore he no longer has any obligations to the 
Vedic injunctions. Such a Kr�J;Ia conscious person is no longer interested in 
material activities and no longer takes pleasure in material arrangements 
like wine, women and similar infatuations.

A self-realized man is no longer obliged to perform any prescribed duty,

Kr�!la consciousness, under proper guidance and without attachment to the 
result of the work, is certainly making progress toward the supreme goal of 
life. Arjuna is told that he should fight in the Battle of Kuruk�etra for the 
interest of Kr�!J.a because Kr�!la wanted him to fight. To be a good man or 
a nonviolent man is a personal attachment, but to act on behalf of the 
Supreme is to act without attachment for lb-e result. That is perfect action 
of the highest degree, recommended by the Supreme Personality of 
Godhead, Sri Kr�!J.a. Vedic rituals, like prescribed sacrifices, are performed 
for purification of impious activities that were performed in the field of 
sense gratification. But action in Kr�!la consciousness is transcendental to 
the reactions of good or evil work. A Kr�!la conscious person has no attach­
ment for the result but_ acts on behalf of Kr�!la alone. He engages in all 
kinds of activities, but is completely nonattached.

Nonetheless they performed all prescribed activities just to set examples 
for the people in general. J anaka was the father of Sita, and father-in-law 
of Lord Sri Raina. Being a great devotee of the Lord, he was transcenden­
tally situated, but because he was the King of Mithila (a subdivision of 
Behar province in India), he ha�to teach his subjects how to fight right­
eously in battle. He and his subjects fought to teach people in general that 
violence is also necessary in a situation where good arguments fail. Before 
the Battle of Kuruk�etra, every effort was made to avoid the war, even by 
the Supreme Personality of Godhead, ·but the other party was determined 
to fight. So for such a right cause, there is a necessity for fighting. 
Although one who is situated in Kr��a consciousness may not have any 
interest in the world, he still works to teach the public how to live and 
how to act. Experienced persons in Kr��a consciousness can act in such a 
way that others will follow, and this is explained in the following verse.

himself smokes. Lord Caitanya said that a teacher should behave properly 
even before he begins teaching. One who teaches in that way is called 
iiciirya, or the ideal teacher. Therefore, a teacher must follow the principles 
of siiStra (scripture) to reach the common man. The teacher cannot.manu­
facture rules against the prinljples of revealed scriptures. The revealed 
scriptures, like Manu-samhitii and similar others, are considered the stan­
dard books to be followed by human society. Thus the leader's teaching 
should be based on the principles of the standard rules as they are practiced 
by the great teachers. The Srimad�Bhiigavatam also affirms that one should 
follow in the footsteps of great devotees, and that is the way of progress 
on the path of spiritual realization. The king or the executive head of a 
state, the father and the school teacher are all considered to be natural 
leaders of the innocent people in general. All such natural leaders have a 
great responsibility to their dependents; therefore they must be conversant 
with standard books of moral and spiritual codes.

The Supreme Personality of Godhead is described in the Vedic litera-

tam devatiiniim paramam ca daivatam 
patim patiniim paramam parastiid

"The Supreme Lord is the controller of all other controllers, and He is the 
greatest of all the diverse planetary leaders. Everyone is under His control. 
All entities are delegated with particular power only by the Supreme Lord; 
they are not supreme themselves. He is also worshipable by all demigods 
and is the supreme director of all directors. Therefore, He is transcendental 
to all kinds of material leaders and controllers and is worshipable by all. 
There is no one greater than Him, and He is the supreme cause of all 
causes. 
"He does not possess bodily form like that of an ordinary living entity. 
There is no difference between His body and His soul. He is absolute. All 
His senses are transcendental. Any one of His senses can perform the action 
of any other sense. Therefore, no one is greater than Him or equal to Him. 
His potencies are multifarious, and thus His deeds are automatically per­
formed as a natural sequence." (SvetiiSvatara Upan�ad 6.7-8) 
Since everything is in full opulence in the Personality'of Godhead and is 
existing in full truth, there is no duty for the Supreme Personality of 
Godhead to perform. One who must receive the results of work has some 
designated duty, but one who has nothing to achieve within the three 
planetary systems certainly has no duty. And yet Lord K��a is engaged on 
the Battlefield of Kurulu}etra as the leader of the k�atriyas because the 
k§atriyas are duty-bound to give protection to the distressed. Although He 
is above all the regulations of the revealed scriptures, He does not do 
anything that violates the revealed scriptures.

Varra-sankara is unwanted population which disturbs the peace of the 
general society. In order to check this social disturbance, there are pre­
scribed rules and regulations by which the population can automatically 
become peaceful and organized for spiritual progress in life. When Lord 
Kr�Qa descends, naturally He deals with such rules and regulations in 
order to maintain the prestige and necessity of such important perform­
ances. The Lord is the father of all living entities, and if the living entities 
are misguided, indirectly the responsibility goes to the Lord. Therefore, 
whenever there is general disregard of regulative principles, the Lord 
Himself descends and corrects the society. We should, however, note 
carefully that although we have to follow in the footsteps of the Lord, we 
still have to remember that we cannot imitate Him. Following and imi­
tating are not on the same level. We cannot imitate the Lord by lifting 
Govardhana Hill, as the Lord did in His childhood. It is impossible for any 
human being. We have to follow His instructions, but we may not imitate 
Him at any. time. The Srimad-Bhiigavatam affirms:

trying to imitate their actions. One ·should not try to drink the ocean of 
poison in imitation of Lord Siva." (Bhiig. 10.33.30) 
We should always consider the position of the iSvaras, or those who can 
actually control the movements of the sun and moon, as superior. Without 
such power, one cannot imitate the isvaras, who are superpowerful. Lord 
Siva drank poison to the extent of swallowing an ocean, but if any 
common man tries to drink even a fragment of such poison, he will be 
killed. There are many psuedo-devotees of Lord Siva who want to indulge 
in smoking giiiijii (marijuana) and similar intoxicating drugs, forgetting 
that by so imitating the acts of Lord Siva they are calling death very near. 
Similarly, there are some psuedo-devotees of Lord Kr�tta who prefer to 
imitate the Lord in His riisa-lilii, or dance of love, forgetting their inability 
to lift Govardhana Hill. It is best, therefore, that one not try to imitate the 
powerful, but simply follow their instructions; nor should one try to 
occupy their posts without qualification. There are so many "incarnations" 
of God without the power of the Supreme Godhead.

A person in Kf�pa consciousness and a person not in Kr�pa conscious­
ness are differentiated by different desires. A Kf�pa conscious person does 
not do anything which is not conducive to development of Kr�pa con­
sciousness. He may even act exactly like the ignorant person, who is too 
much attached to material activities, but one is engaged in such activities 
for the satisfaction of his sense gratification, whereas the other is engaged 
for the satisfaction of Kr�pa. Therefore, the Kf�pa conscious person is 
required to show the people how to act and how to engage the results of 
action for the purpose of Kr�pa consciousness.

understanding Kr��a, who is the ultimate goal of life. But because the 
conditioned souls do not know anything beyond sense gratification, they 
study the Vedas to that end. Through sense regulations, however, one is 
gradually elevated to Kr��a consciousness. Therefore a realized soul in 
Kr��a consciousness should not disturb others in their activities or under­
standing, but he should act by showing how the results of all work can be 
dedicated to the service of Krwa. The learned Kr��a conscious person may 
act in such a way that the ignorant person working for sense gratification 
may learn how to act and how to behave. Although the ignorant man is not 
to be disturbed in his activities, still, a slightly developed Kr��a conscious 
person may directly be engaged in the service of the Lord without waiting 
for other Vedic formulas. For this fortunate man there is no need to follow 
the Vedic rituals, because in direct Kr��a consciousness one can have all 
the results simply by following the prescribed duties of a particular person.

positions. The person in material consciousness is convinced by false ego 
that he is the doer of everything. He does not know that the mechanism of 
the body is produced by material nature, which works under the supervi­
sion of the Supreme Lord. The materialistic person has no knowledge that 
ultimately he is under the control of K�lJ.a. The person in false ,ego takes 
all credit for doing everything independently, and that is the symptom of 
his nescience. He does not know that this gross and subtle body is the 
creation of material nature, under the order of the Supreme Personality of 
Godhead, and as such his bodily and mental activities should be engaged 
in the service of Kr�lJ.a, in Kr�lla consciousness. The ignorant man forgets 
that the Supreme Personality of Godhead is known as Hr�ikesa, or the mas­
ter of the senses of the material body, for due to his long misuse of the 
senses in sense gratification, he is factually bewildered by the false ego, 
which makes him forget his eternal relationship with Kr�lJ.a.

Bhagavad-gita As It Is 
[Ch. 3 
PURPORT 
The knower of the Absolute Truth is convinced of his awkward position 
in material association. He knows that he is part and parcel of the Supreme 
Personality of Godhead, Kr�pa, and that his position should not be in the 
material creation. He knows his real identity as part and parcel of the Su­
preme, who is eternal bliss and knowledge, and he realizes that somehow 
or other he is entrapped in the material conception of life. In his pure 
state of existence he is meant to dovetail his activities in devotional service 
to the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Kr�pa. He therefore engages him­
self in the activities of Krwa consciousness and becomes naturally un­
attached to the activities of the material senses, which are all circumstan­
tial and temporary. He knows that his material condition of life is under 
the supreme control of the Lord; consequently he is not disturbed by all 
kinds of material reactions, which he considers to be the mercy of the Lord. 
According to Srimad-Bhiigavatam, one who knows the Absolute Truth in 
three different features-namely Brahman, Paramatma, and the Supreme 
Personality of Godhead-is called tattvavit, for he knows also his own 
factual position in relationship with the Supreme.

not unsettle them, although these duties are inferior due to the performers' 
lack of knowledge. 
PURPORT 
Persons who are unknowledgeable falsely identify with gross material 
consciousness and are full of material designations. This body is a gift of 
the mat�rial nature, and one who is too much attached to the bodily 
consciousness is called mandan, or a lazy person without understanding of 
spirit soul. Ignorant men think of the body as the self; bodily connections 
with others are accepted as kinsmanship; the land in which the body is 
obtained is the object of worship; and the formalities of religious rituals 
are considered ends in themselves. Social work, nationalism, and altruism 
are some of the activities for such materially designated persons. Under 
the spell of such designations, they are always busy in the material field; 
for them spiritual realization is a myth, and so they are not interested. 
Such bewildered persons may even be engaged in such primary moral 
principles of life as nonviolence and similar materially benevolent work. 
Those who are, however, enlightened in spiritual life, should not try to 
agitate such materially engrossed persons. Better to prosecute one's own 
spiritual activities silently. 
Men who are ignorant cannot appreciate activities in Kr�pa conscious­
ness, and therefore Lord Kr�pa advises us not to disturb them and simply 
waste valuable time. But the devotees of the Lord are more kind than the 
Lord because they understand the purpose of the Lord. Consequently they 
undertake all kinds of risks, even to the point of approaching ignorant men 
to try to engage them in the acts of Kr�pa consciousness, which are ab­
solutely necessary for the human being.

TRANSLATION 
Therefore, 0 ArjWla, surrendering all your works unto Me, with mind 
intent on Me, and withoutc desire for gain and. free from egoism and 
lethargy, fight. 
PURPORT 
This verse clearly indicates the purpose of the Bhagavad-gita. The Lord 
instructs that one has to beeome fully Kr��a conscious to discharge duties, 
as if in military discipline. Such an injunction may make things a little 
difficult; nevertheless duties must be carried out, with dependence on 
Kr��a, because that is the constitutional position of the living entity. The 
living entity cannot be happy independent of the cooperation of the 
Supreme Lord because the eternal constitutional position of the living 
entity is to become subordinate to the desires of the Lord. Arjuna was, 
therefore, ordered by Sri Kr��a to fight as if the Lord were his military 
commander. One has to sacrifice everything for the good will of the 
Supreme Lord, and at the same time discharge prescribed duties without 
claiming proprietorship. Arjuna did not have to consider the order of the 
Lord; he had only to execute His order. The Supreme Lord is the Soul of 
all souls; therefore, one who depends solely and wholly on the Supreme 
Soul without personal consideration, or in other words, one who is fully 
Krgta conscious, is called adhyatma-cetasa. Nirasi{l means that one has to 
act on the order of the master. Nor should one ever expect fruitive results. 
The cashier may count millions of dollars for his employer, but he does not 
claim a cent for himself. Similarly, one has to realize that nothing in the 
world belongs to any individual person, but that everything belongs to the 
Supreme Lord. That is the real purport of mayi, or unto Me. And when 
one acts in such Kr��a consciousness, certainly he does not claim proprie­
torship over anything. This consciousness is called nirmama, or nothing is 
mine. And, if there is any reluctance to execute such a stern order which 
is without consideration of so-called kinsmen in the bodily relationship, 
Text 31] 
Karma-yoga 
197 
that reluctance should be thrown off; in this way one may become 
vigata-jvara, or without feverish mentality or lethargy. Everyone, according 
to his quality and position, has a particular type of work to discharge, and 
all such duties may be discharged in Krwa consciousness, as described 
above. That will lead one to the path of liberation.

PURPORT 
The injunction of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Kr��a, is the 
essence of all Vedic wisdom, and therefore is eternally true without excep­
tion. As the Vedas are eternal, so this truth of Kr��a consciousness is also 
eternal. One should have firm faith in this injunction, without envying the 
Lord. There are many philosophers who write comments on the Bhag(lvad­
gita but have no faith in Kr��a. They will never be liberated from the 
bondage of fruitive action. But an ordinary man with firni faith in the 
eternal injunctions of the Lord, even though unable to execute such orders, 
becomes liberated from the bondage of the law of karma. In the beginning

is punishment for disobedience to the order of the supreme executive 
head, so there is certainly punishment for the disobedience of the order of 
the Supreme Personality of Godhead. A disobedient person, however great 
he may be, is ignorant of his own self, of the Supreme Brahman, and 
Paramatma and the Personality of Godhead, due to a vacant heart. There­
for there is no hope of perfection of life for him.

Even a man of knowledge acts according to his own nature, for every­

PURPORT 
Unless one is situated on the transcendental platform of K�pa con­
sciousness, he cannot get free from the influence of the modes of material 
nature, as it is confirmed by the Lord in the Seventh Chapter (7 .14 ). There­
fore, even for the most highly educated person on the mundane plane, it is 
impossible to get out of the entanglement of maya simply by theoretical 
knowledge, or by separating the soul from the body. There are many so­
called spiritualists· who outwardly pose to be advanced in the science, but 
inwardly or privately are completely under the particular modes of nature 
which they are unable to surpass. Academically, one may be very learned, 
but because of his long association with material nature, he is in bondage. 
K�pa consciousness helps one to get out of the material entanglement,­
even though one may be engaged in his prescribed duties. Therefore, with­
out being fully in Kr�pa consciousness, no one should suddenly give up his 
prescribed duties and become a so-called yogi or transcendentalist artifi­
cially. It is better to be situated in one's position and to try to attain Kr�pa · 
consciousness under superior training. Thus one may be freed from the 
clutches of maya.

TRANSLATION 
Attraction and repulsion for sense objects are felt by embodied beings, ' 
but one should not fall under the control of senses and sense objects 
because they are stumbling blocks on the path of sel f-realization. 
PURPORT 
Those who are in Kr�tta consciousness are naturally reluctant to engage 
in material sense gratifications. But those who are not in such conscious­
ness should follow the rules and regulations of the revealed scriptures. 
Unrestricted sense enjoyment is the cause of material encagement, but one 
who follows the rules and regulations of the revealed scriptures does not 
become entangled by the sense objects. For example, sex enjoyment is a 
necessity for the conditioned soul, and sex enjoyment is allowed under the 
license of marriage ties. For example, according to scriptural injunctions, 
one is forbidden to engage in sex relationships with any women other than 
one's wife. All other women are to be considered as one's mother. But, in 
spite of such injunctions, a man is still inclined to have sex relationships 
with other women. These propensities are to be curbed; otherwise they 
will be stumbling blocks on the path of self-realization. As long as the 
material body is there, the necessities of the material body are allowed, but 
under rules and regulations. And yet, we should not rely upon the control 
of such allowances. One has to follow those rules and regulations, un­
attached to them, because practice of sense gratifications under regulations 
may also lead one to go astray-as much as there is always the chance of an 
accident, even on the royal roads. Although they may be very carefully 
maintained, no one can guarantee that there will be no danger even on the 
safest road. The sense enjoyment spirit has been current a very long, long

time, owing to material association. Therefore, in spite of regulated sense 
enjoyment, there is every chanc.e offalling down; therefore any attachment 
for regulated sense enjoyment must also be avoided by all means. But 
action in the loving service of Kr�va detaches one from all kinds of sensory 
activities. Therefore, no one should try to be detached from Kr�pa con· 
sciousness at any stage of life. The whole purpose of detachment from all 
kinds of sense attachment is ultimately to become situated on the platform 
of Kr�va consciousness.

It is far better to discharge one's prescribed duties, even though they 
may be faulty, than another's duties. Destruction in the course of per­
forming one's own duty is better than engaging in another's duties, for to 
follow another's path is dangerous. 
PURPORT 
One should therefore discharge his prescribed duties in full Kr�pa con­
sciousness rather than those prescribed for others. Prescribed duties com­
plement one's psychophysical condition, under the spell of the modes of 
material nature. Spiritual duties are as ordered by the spiritual master, for 
the transcendental service of Kf�pa. But both materially or spiritually, one

should stick to his prescribed duties even up to death, rather than imitate 
another's prescribed duties. Duties on the spiritual platform and duties on 
the material platform may be different, but the principle of following the 
authorized direction is always good for the performer. When one is under 
the spell of the modes of material nature, one should follow the prescribed 
rules for particular situations and should no.t imitate others. For example, 
a briihmapa, who is in the mode of goodness, is nonviolent, whereas a 
kfatriya, who is in the mode of passion, is allowed to be violen't. As such, 
for a k1atriya it is better to be vanquished following the rules of violence 
than to imitate a briihmapa who follows the principles of nonviolence. 
Everyone has to cleanse his heart by a gradual process, not abruptly. How­
ever, when one transcends the modes of material nature and is fully 
situated in K":pa consciousness, he can perform anything and everything 
under the direction of the bona fide spiritual master. In that complete 
stage of Kr�:pa consciousness, the k1atriya may act as a briihmapa, or a 
briihmapa may act as a k1atriya. In the transcendental stage, the distinc­
tions of the material world do not apply. For example, Visvimitra was 
originally a k1atriya, but later on he acted as a briihmana, whereas 
Para8urama was a .briihmapa, but later on he acted as a k§atriya. Being 
transcendentally situated, they could do so; but as long as one is on the 
material platform, he must perform his duties according to the modes of 
material nature. At the same time, he must have a full sense of Kw;ta 
consciousness.

pure, and free from all material contaminations. Therefore, by nature he is 
not subjected to the sins of the material world. But when he is in contact 
with the material nature, he acts in many sinful ways without hesitation, 
and sometimes even against his will. As such, Arjuna's question to Kr�J;ta is 
very sanguine, as to the perverted nature of the living entities. Although the 
. living entity sometimes does not want to act in sin, he is still forced to act. 
Sinful actions are not, however, impelled by the Supersoul within, but are 
due to another cause , as the Lord explains in the next verse.

Bhagavad-gita As It Is 
[Ch. 3 
TRANSLATION 
The Blessed Lord said: It is lust only, Arjuna, which is born of contact 
with the material modes of passion and later transformed into wrath, and 
which is the all-devouring, sinful enemy of this world. 
PURPORT 
When a living entity comes in contact with the material creation, his 
eternal love for Kr�l).a is transformed into lust, in association with the mode 
of passion. Or, in other words, the sense of love of God becomes trans­
formed into lust, as milk in contact with sour tamarind is transformed into 
yogurt. Then again, when lust is unsatisfied, it turns into wrath; wrath is 
transformed into illusion, and illusion continues the material existence. 
Therefore, lust is the greatest enemy of the liVing entity, and it is lust only 
which induces the pure living entity to remain entangled in the material 
world. Wrath is the manifestation of the mode of ignorance; these modes 
exhibit themselves as wrath and other corollaries. If, therefore, the modes 
of passion, instead of being degraded into the modes of ignorance, are ele­
vated to the modes of goodness by the prescribed method of living and 
acting, then one can be saved from the degradation of wrath by spiritual 
attachment. 
The Supr�me Personality of Godhead expanded Himself into many for 
His ever-increasing spiritual bliss, and the living entities are parts and parcels 
of this spiritual bliss. They also have partial independence, but by misuse 
of their independence, when the service attitude is transformed into the 
propensity for sense enjoyment, they come under the sway of lust. This 
material creation is created by the Lord to give a facility to the conditioned 
souls to fulfill these lustful propensities, and when they are completely 
baffled by prolonged lustful activities, the living entities begin to inquire 
abo!Jt their real position. 
This inquiry is the beginning of the Vediinta-sutras, wherein it is said, 
athiito brohma-jijiiiisii: one should inquire into the Supreme. And the Su­
preme is defined in Srimad-Bhiigavatam as janmiidyasya yato 'nvayiid 
itarata.S ca, or, "The origin of everything is the Supreme Brahman." 
Therefore, the origin of lust is also in the Supreme. If, therefore, lust is 
transformed into love for the Supreme, or transformed into Kr�pa con­
sciousness-or, in other words, desiring everything for Kr�!la-then both 
lust and wrath can be spiritualized. Hanumah, the great servitor of Lord 
Rama, engaged his wrath upon his enemies for the satisfaction of the Lord.

Therefore, lust and wrath, when they are employed in Kr�Q.a consciousness; 
become our friends instead of our enemies.

TRANSLATION 
As fire is covered by smoke, as a mirror is covered by dust, or as the 
embryo is covered by the womb, similarly, the living entity is covered by 
different degrees of this lust. 
PURPORT 
There are three degrees of covering of the living entity by which his 
pure consciousness is obscured. This covering is but lust under different 
manifestations like smoke in the fire, dust on the mirror, and the womb 
about the embryo. When lust is compared to smoke, it is understood that 
the fire of the living spark can be a little perceived. In other words, when 
the living entity exhibits his �Q.a consciousness slightly, he may be likened 
to the fire covered by smoke. Although fire is necessary where there is 
smoke, there is no overt manifestation of fire in the early stage. This 
stage is like the beginning of Kr�Q.a consciousness. The dust on the mirror 
refers to a cleansing process of the mirror of the mind by so many spiritual 
, 
' 
methods. The best process is to chant the holy names of the Lord. The 
embryo covered by the womb is an analogy illustrating a helpless 
_
position, 
206 
Bhagavad-glta As It Is 
[Ch. 3 
for the child in the womb is so helpless that he cannot even move. This 
stage of living condition can be compared to that of the trees. The trees are 
also living entities, but they have been put in such a condition of life by 
such a great exhibition of lust that they are almost void of all conscious­
ness. The covered mirror is compared to the birds and beasts, and the 
smoke covered fire is compared to the human being. In the form of a 
human being, the living entity may revive a little Kr�:pa consciousness, and, 
if he makes further development, the fire of spiritual life can be kindled in 
the human form of Jife. By careful handling of the smoke in the fire, the 
fire can be made to blaze. Therefore the human form of life is a chance for 
the living entity to escape the entanglement of material existence. In the 
human form of life, one can conquer the enemy, lust, by cultivation of 
Kr�:pa consciousness under able guidance.

Thus, a man's pure consciousness is covered by his eternal enemy in the 
form of lust, which is never satisfied and which burns like fire.

It is said in the Manu-smrti that lust cannot be satisfied by any amount 
of sense enjoyment, just as fire is never extinguished by a constant supply

of fuel. In the material world, the center of all activities is sex, and thus 
this material world is called maithunya-iigiira, or the shackles of sex life. In 
the ordinary prison house, criminals are kept within bars; similarly, the 
criminals who are disobedient to the laws of the Lord are shackled by sex 
life. Advancement of material civilization on the basis of sense gratification 
means increasing the duration of the material existence of a living entity. 
Therefore, this lust is the symbol of ignorance by which the living entity 
is kept within the material world. While one enjoys sense gratification, it 
may be that there is some feeling of happiness, but actually that so-called 
feeling of happiness is the ultimate enemy of the sense enjoyer.

so that one who wants to conquer the enemy may know where he can be

mind and the senses become the repositories of lust. Next, the intelligence 
department becomes the capital of such lustful propensities. Intelligence is 
the immediate next-door neighbor of the spirit soul. Lusty intelligence in­
fluences the spirit soul to acquire the false ego and identify itself with 
matter, and thus with the mind and senses. The spirit soul becomes ad­
dicted to enjoying the material senses and mistakes this as true happiness. 
This false identification of the spirit soul is very nicely explained in the 
S rimad-Bhiigavatam:

"A human being who identifies this body made of three elements with his 
self, who considers. the by-products of the body to be his kinsmen, who 
considers the land of birth as worshipable, and who goes to the place of 
pilgrimage simply to .take a bath rather than meet men of transcendental 
knowledge there, is to be considered as an ass or a cow."

Text 42] 
Karma-yoga 
209 
PURPORT 
The Lord advised Arjuna to regulate the senses from the very beginning 
so that he could curb the greatest sinful enemy, lust, which destroys the 
urge for self-realization, and specifically, knowledge of the self. ]iiiinam 
refers to knowledge of self as distinguished from non-self, or,,in other 
words, knowledge that the spirit soul is not the body. Vijiiiinam refers to 
specific knowledge of the spirit soul and knowledge of one's constitutional 
position and his relationship to the Supreme Soul. It is explained thus 
in 
the Srimad-Bhiigavatam: jiiiinam parama-guhyam 
me yad-vijiiiina­
samanvitam/sarahasyam tad-angam ca grhiina gaditam mayii: "The know­
ledge of the self and the Supreme Self is very confidential and mysterious, 
being veiled by miiyii, but such knowledge and specific realization can be 
understood if it is explained by the Lord Himself." Bhagavad-gitii gives us 
that knowledge, specifically knowledge of the self. The living entities are 
parts and parcels of the Lord, and therefore they are simply meant to serve 
the Lord. This consciousness is called Kr�JJ.a consciousness. So, from the 
very beginning of life one has to learn this Kr�JJ.a consciousness, and thereby 
one may become fully Kr�JJ.a conscious and act accordingly. 
Lust is only the perverted reflection of the love of God which is natural 
for every living entity. But if one is educated in Kr�:p.a consciousness from 
the very beginn�ng, that natural love of God cannot deteriorate into lust. 
When love of God deteriorates into lust, it is very difficult to return to the 
normal condition. Nonetheless, Kr�JJ.a consciousness is so powerful tha,t 
even a late beginner can become a lover of God by following the regulative 
principles of devotional service. So, from any stage of life, or from the 
time of understanding its urgency, one can begin regulating the senses in 
Kr�:p.a consciousness, devotional service of the Lord, and turn the lust into 
love of Godhead-the highest perfectional stage of human life.

TRANSLATION 
The working senses are superior to dull matter; mind is higher than the 
senses; intelligence is still higher than the mind; and he [the soul] is even 
higher than the intelligence. 
PURPORT 
The senses are different outlets for the activities of lust. Lust is reserved 
within the body, but it is given vent through the senses. Therefore, the 
senses are superior to the body as a whole. These outlets are not in use 
when there is superior consciousness, or Kr�:v.a consciousness. In Kr�:pa 
consciousness the soul makes direct connection with the Supreme Person­
ality of Godhe�d; therefore the bodily functions, as described here, 
ultimately end in the Supreme Soul. Bodily action means the functions of 
the senses, and stopping the senses means stopping all bodily actions. But 
since the mind is active, then, even though the body may be silent and at 
rest, the mind will act-as it does during dreaming. But, above the mind 
there is the determination of the intelligence, and above the intelligence is 
the soul proper. If, therefore, the soul is directly engaged with the Supreme, 
naturally all other subordinates, namely, the intelligence, mind and the 
senses, will be automatically engaged. In the Katha Upan�ad there is a 
passage in which it is said that the objects of sense gratification are superior 
to the senses, and mind is superior to the sense objects. If, therefore, the 
mind is directly engaged in the service of the Lord constantly, then there 
is no chance of the senses becoming engaged in other ways. This mental 
attitude has already been explained. If the mind is engaged in the tran­
scendental service of the Lord, there is no chance of its being engaged in 
the lower propensities. In the Katha Upan�ad the soul has been described 
as mahan, the great. Therefore the soul is above all-namely, the sense 
objects, the senses, the mind and the intelligence. Therefore, directly 
understanding the constitutional position of the soul is the solution of the 
whole problem. 
With intelligence one has to seek out the constitutional position of the 
soul and then engage the mind always in Krwa conscious�ess. That solves 
1 
Text 43] 
Karma-yoga 
211 
the whole problem. A neophyte spiritualist is generally advised to keep 
aloof from the objects of senses. One has to strengthen the mind by use of 
intelligence. If by intelligence one engages one's mind in Kr��a conscious­
ness, by complete surrender unto the Supreme Personality of Godhead, 
then, automatically, the mind becomes stronger, and even though the 
senses are very strong, like serpents, they will be no more effective than 
serpents with broken fangs. But even though the soul is the master of 
intelligence and mind, and the senses also, still, unless it is strengthened by 
association with Kr�J;la in Kr�J;la consciousness, there is every chance of 
falling down due to the agitated mind.

Kr��a consciousness by knowing oneself as the eternal servitor of the

influenced 
by propensities for lust and desire for dominating the

are the greatest enemies of the conditioned soul; but by the strength of 
Kr�:p.a consciousness, one can control the material senses, the mind and 
the intelligence. One may not give up work and prescribed duties all of a 
sudden; but by gradually developing K�:p.a consciousness, one can be 
situated in a transcendental position without being influenced by the 
material senses and the mind-by steady intelligence directed toward 
one's pure identity. This is the sum total of this chapter. In the im­
mature stage of material existence, philosophical speculations and arti­
ficial attempts to control the senses by the so-called practice of yogic 
postures can never help a man toward spiritual life. He must be trained 
in Kf�pa consciousness by higher intelligence. 
Thus end the Bhaktivedanta Purports to the Third Chapter of the 
Srimad�Bhagavad-gita in the matter of Karma-yoga, or the Discharge of 
One's Prescribed Duty in Ktff)a Consciousness.

TRANSLATION 
The Blessed Lord said: I instructed this imperishable science of yoga to 
the sun-god, Vivasvan, and Vivasvan instructed it to Manu, the father of 
mankind, and Manu in turn instructed it to l�vaku. 
PURPORT 
Herein we find the history of the Bhagavad-gitii traced from a remote 
time when it was delivered to the royal order, the kings of all planets. This 
science is especially meant for the protection of the inhabitants, and there­
fore the royal order should understand it in order to be able to rule the 
citizens and protect them from the material bondage to lust. Human life 
is meant for cultivation of spiritual knowledge, in eternal relationship with 
the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and the executive heads of all states 
and all planets are obliged to impart this lesson to the citizens by educa� 
tion, culture and devotion. In other words, the executive heads of all states 
are intended to spread the science of Kr�:r;ta consciousness so that the 
people may take advantage of this great science and pursue a successful 
path, utilizing the opportunity of the human form of life. 
In this millennium, the sun-god is known as Vivasvan, the king of the 
sun, which is the origin of all planets within the solar system. In the 
Brahma-sarhhitii it is stated: 
yac-cak§ur e§a savitii sakala-grahiirtiirh 
riijii samasta-sura-murttir ase{>a-tejii{l. 
yasyiijiiayii bhramati sambhrta-kiilacakro 
govindam iidi-pum§arh tam aharh bhajiimi 
"Let me worship," Lord Brahma said, "the Supreme Personality of God­
head, Govinda (Kr�:r;ta], who is the original person and under whose order 
the sun, which is the king of all planets, is assuming immense power and 
heat. The sun represents the eye of the Lord and traverses its orbit in 
obedience to His order." 
The s-i.tn is the king of the planets, and the sun-god (at present of the 
name Vivasvan) rules the sun planet, which is controlling all other planets 
by supplying heat and light. He is rotating under the order of Kr�p.a, and 
Lord Kr�pa originally made Vivasvan His first disciple to understand the 
science of Bhagavad-gitii. The Gitii is not, therefore, a speculative treatise 
Text 1) 
Transcendental Knowledge 
215 
for the insignificant mundane scholar but is a standard book of knowledge 
coming down from time immemorial. In the Mahiibharata (Siinti-parva 
348.51-52) we can trace out the history of the Gitii as follows: 
tretii-yugiidau ca tato vivasviin manave dadau 
manus ca loka-bhrty-artharh sutiiyek§viikave dadau 
ik§viiku"{lii ca kathito vyiipya lokiin avasthitii� 
"In the beginning of the Treta-yuga [millennium] this science of the 
relationship with the Supreme was delivered by Vivasvan to Manu. Manu, 
being the father of mankind, gave it to his son Maharaja lk�vaku, the King 
of this earth planet and forefather of the Raghu dynasty in which Lord 
Ramacandra appeared. Therefore, Bhagavad-gitii existed in the human 
society from the time of Maharaja Ik�vaku." 
At the present moment we have just passed through five thousand years 
of the K ali-yuga, which lasts 432,000 years. Before this there was Dvapara­
yuga (800,000 years), and before that there was Treta-yuga (1,200,000 
years). Thus, some 2,005,000 years ago, Manu spoke the Bhagavad-gitii to 
his disciple and son Maharaja lk�vaku, the K ing of this planet earth. The age 
of the current Manu is calculated to last some 305,300,000 years, of which 
120,400,000 have passed. Accepting that before the birth of Manu, the Gitii 
was spoken by the Lord to His disciple, the sun-god Vivasvan, a rough 
estimate is that the Gitii was spoken at least 120,400,000 years ago; and 
in human society it has been extant for two million years. It was respoken 
by the Lord again to Arjuna about five thousand years ago. That is the 
rough estimate of the history of the Gitii, according to the Gitii itself and 
according to the version of the speaker, Lord Sri Kr�IJ.a. It was spoken to 
the sun-god Vivasvan because he is also a k§atriya and is the father of all 
k§atriyas who are descendants of the sun-god, 
or the siirya-varhsa 
k§atriyas. Because Bhagavad-gitii is as good as the Vedas, being spoken by 
the Supreme Personality of Godhead, this knowledge is apauru§eya, super­
human. Since the Vedic instructions are accepted as they are, without 
human interpretation, the Gitii must therefore be accepted without mun­
dane interpretation. The mundane wranglers may speculate on the Gitii in 
their own ways, but that is not Bhagavad-gitii as it is. Therefore, Bhagavad­
gitii has to be accepted as it is, from the disciplic succession, and it is 
described herein that the Lord spoke to the sun-god, the sun-god spoke to 
his son Manu, and Manu spoke to his son lk�vaku.

TRANSLATION 
This supreme science was thus received through the chain of disciplic 
succession, and the saintly kings understood it in that way. But in course 
of time the succession was broken, and therefore the science as it is appears 
to be lost. 
PURPORT 
It is clearly stated that the Gitii was especially meant for the saintly 
kings because they were to execute its purpose in ruling over the citizens. 
Certainly Bhagavad-gitii was never meant for the demonic persons, who 
would dissipate its value for no one's benefit and would devise all types of 
interpretations according to personal whims. As soon as the original pur­
pose was scattered by the motives of the unscrupulous commentators, 
there arose the need to reestablish the disciplic succession. Five thousand 
years ago it was detected by the Lord Himself that the disciplic succession 
was broken, and therefore He declared that the purpose of the Gitii 
appeared to be 'lost. In the same. way, at the present moment also there are 
so many editions of the Gitii (especially in English), but almost all of 
them are not according to authorized disciplic succession. There are 
innumerable interpretations rendered by different mundane scholars, but 
almost all of them do not accept the Supreme Personality of Godhead, 
Kr�pa, although they make a good business on the words of Sri Kr�pa. 
Text 3] 
Transcendental Knowledge 
217-
This spirit is demonic, because demons do not believe in God but 
simply enjoy the property of the Supreme. Since there is a great need 
of an edition of the Gitii in English, as it is received by the paramparii 
(disciplic succession) system, an attempt is made herewith to fulfill this 
great want. Bhagavad-gitii-accepted as it is-is a great boon to humanity;

a waste of time.

That very ancient science of the relationship with the Supreme is 
today told by Me to you because you are My devotee as well as My 
friend; therefore you can understand the transcendental mystery of this 
science. 
PURPORT 
There are two classes of men, namely the devotee and the demon. The 
Lord selected Arjuna as the recipient of this great ssience owing to his 
becoming the devotee of the Lord, but for the demon it is not possible to 
understand this great mysterious science. There are a number of editions 
of this great book of knowledge, and some of them have commentaries by 
the devotees, and some of them have commentaries by the demons.

Commentation by the devotees is real, whereas that of the demons is 
useless. Arjuna accepts Sri Kr�pa as the Supreme Personality of Godhead, 
and any commentary on the Gitii following in the footsteps of Arjuna is 
real devotional service to the cause of this great science. The demonic, 
however, concoct something about Kr�pa and mislead the public and 
general readers from the path of Krwa's instructions. One should try to 
follow the disciplic succession from Arjuna, and thus be benefitted.

PURPORT 
Arjuna is an accepted devotee of the Lord, so how could he not 
believe Kr�pa's words? The fact is that Arjuna is not inquiring for 
himself but for those who do not believe in the Supreme Personality 
of Godhead or for the demons who do not like the idea that Kr�pa 
should be accepted as the Supreme Personality of Godhead; for them 
only Arjuna inquires on this point, as if he were himself not aware of 
the Personality of Godhead, or Kr�pa. As it will be evident from the 
Tenth Chapter, Arjuna knew perfectly well that Kr�pa is the Supreme 
Text 5] 
Transcendental Knowledge 
219 
Personality of Godhead, the fountainhead of everything and the last 
word in Transcendence. Of course, Kr�!ia also appeared as the son of 
Devaki on this earth. How Kr�!la remained the same Supreme Personality 
of Godhead, the eternal, original person, is very difficult for an ordinary 
man to understand. 
Therefore, to clarify this point, Arjuna put this 
question before Kr�!la so that He Himself could speak authoritatively. 
That Kr�!la is the supreme authority is accepted by the whole world, not 
only at present, but from time immemorial, and the demons alone reject 
Him. Anyway, since Kr�!la is the authority accepted by all, Atjuna put 
this question before Him in order that Kr�!la would describe Himself 
without being depicted by the demons who always try to distort Him in 
a way understandable to the demons and their followers. It is necessary 
that everyone, for his own interest, know the science of Krwa. Therefore, 
when Kr�!la Himself speaks about Himself, it is auspicious for all the worlds. 
To the demons, such explanations by Kr�!la Himself may appear to be 
strange because the demons always study Kr�!la from their own standpoint, 
but those who are devotees heartily welcome the statements of Kr�!la when 
they are spoken by Kr�!la Himself. The devotees will always worship such 
authoritative statements of Kr�!la because they are always eager to know 
more and more about Him. The atheists, who consider Kr�!ia an ordinary 
man, may in this way come to know that Kr�!la is superhuman, that He is 
sac-cid-iinanda-vigraha-the eternal form of bliss and knowledge-that He 
is transcendental, and that �e is above the domination of the modes of 
material nature and above the influence of time and space. A devotee of 
Kr�!la's, like Atjuna, is undoubtedly above any misunderstanding of the 
transcendental position of Kr�!la. Arjuna 's putting this question before the 
Lord is simply an attempt by the devotee to defy the atheistic attitude of 
persons who consider Kp]!la to be an ordinary human 
-
being subject to the 
modes of material nature.

PURPORT 
ln the Brahma-sarhhitii we have information of many, many incarnations 
of the Lord. It is stated there: 
advaitam acyutam aniidim ananta-riip�m 
iidyarh puriirza-puru§arh nava-yauvanarh ca 
vede§U durllabham adurllabham atma-bhaktau

(Bs. 5.33) 
"I worship the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Govinda [Kr�Q.a], 
who is the original person-absolute, infallible, without beginning, although 
expanded into unlimited forms, still the same original, the oldest, and the 
person always appearing as a fresh youth. Such eternal, blissful, all­
knowing forms of the Lord are usually understood by the best Vedic 
scholars, but they are always manifest to pure, unalloyed devotees." 
It is also stated in Brahma-sarhhitii: 
riimiidi miirtti§u kalii-niyamena ti§than 
niiniivatiiram akarod bhuvane§U kintu 
krgw� svayarh samabhavat parama� pumiin yo

(Bs. 5.39) 
"I worship the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Govinda [Kr�Q.a], who 
is always situated in various incarnations such as Rama, Nrsimha and many 
sub-incarnations as well, but who is the original Personality of Godhead

221. 
known as Kr�!J.a, and who incarnates personally also." 
In the Vedas also it is said that the Lord, although one without a second, 
nevertheless manifests Himself in innumerable forms. He is like the 
vaidurya stone, which changes color yet still remains one. All those multi· 
forms are understood by the pure, unalloyed devotees, but not by a simple 
study of the �das: vede�u durllabham adurllabham atma-bhaktau. Devotees 
like Arjuna are constant companions of the Lord, and whenever the Lord 
incarnates, the associate devotees also incarnate in order to serve the Lord 
in different capacities. A1juna is one of these devotees, and in this verse it 
is understood that some millions of years ago when Lord Kr�!la spoke the 
Bhagavad-gitii to the sun-god Vivasviin, Arjuna, in a different capacity, was 
also present. But the difference between the Lord and Arjuna is that the 
Lord remembered the incidence, whereas Arjuna could not remember. 
That is the difference between the part and parcel living entity and the 
Supreme Lord. Although Arjuna is addressed herein as the mighty hero 
who could subdue the enemies, he is unable to recall what had happened 
in his various past births. Therefore, a living entity, however great he may 
be in the material estimation, ca� never equal the Supreme Lord. Anyone 
who is a constant companion of the Lord is certainly a liberated person, 
but he cannot be equal to the Lord. The Lord is described in the Brahma­
sarhhitii as infallible (acyuta), which means that He never forgets Himself, 
even though He is in material contact. Therefore, the Lord and the living 
entity can never be equal in all respects, even if the living entity is as 
liberated as Arjuna. Although Arjuna is a devotee of the Lord, he some­
times forgets the nature of the Lord, but by the divine grace a devotee 
can at once understand the infallible condition of the Lord, whereas a 
nondevotee or a demon cannot understand this transcendental nature. 
Consequently these descriptions in the Gitii cannot be understood by 
demonic brains. Kr�!la remembered acts which were performed by Him 
millions of years before, but Arjuna could not, despite the fact that both 
Kr�!la and Arjuna are eternal in nature. We may also note herein that a 
living entity forgets everything due to his change of body, but the Lord 
remembers because He does not change His sac-cid-iinanda body. He is 
advaita, which means there is no distinction between His body and 
Himself. Everything in relation to Him is spirit-whereas the conditioned 
soul is different from his material body. And, because the Lord's body 
and self are identical, His position is always different from the ordinary 
living entity, even when He descends to the material platform. The demons 
cannot adjust themselves to this transcendental nature of the Lord, as the 
Lord explains in the following verse.

TRANSLATION 
Although I am unborn and My transcendental body never deteriorates, 
and although I am the Lord of all sentient beings, I still appear in every 
millennium in My original transcendental form. 
PURPORT 
The Lord has spoken about the peculiarity of His birth: although He 
may appear like an ordinary person, He remembers everything of His 
many, many past "births," whereas a common man cannot remember 
what he has done even a few hours before. If someone is asked what he 
did exactly at the same time one day earlier, it would be very difficult for 
a common man to answer immediately. He would surely have to dredge his 
memory to recall what he was doing exactly at the same time one day 
before. And yet, men often dare claim to be God, or Kf�pa. One should 
not be misled by such meaningless claims. Then again, the Lord explains 
His prakrti, or His form. Prakrti means nature as well as svariipa, or one's 
own form. The Lord says that He appears in His own body. He does not 
change His body, as the common living entity changes from one body to 
another. The conditioned soul may have one kind of body in the present 
birth, but he has a different body in the next birth. In the material world, 
the living entity has no fixed body but transmigrates from one body to 
another. The Lord, however, does not do so. Whenever He appears, He 
does so in the same original body, by His internal potency. In other words, 
Jt 
Text 6] 
Transcendental Knowledge 
223 
Kr�va appears in this material world in His original eternal form, with two 
hands, holding a flute. He appears exactly in His eternal body, uncontami­
nated by this material world. Although He appears in the same transcen­
dental body and is Lord of the universe, it still appears that He takes His 
birth like an ordinary living entity. Despite the fact Lord Krwa grows from 
childhood to boyhood and from boyhood to youth, astonishingly enough 
He never ages beyond youth. At the time of the Battle of Kuruk�etra, He had 
many grandchildren at home; or, in other words, He had sufficiently aged 
by material calculations. Still He looked just like a young man twenty or 
twenty-five years old. We never see a picture of Kr�va in old age because 
He never grows old like us, although He is the oldest person in the whole 
creation-past, present, and future. Neither His body nor His intelligence 
ever deteriorates or changes. Therefore, it is clear that in spite of His being 
in the material world, He is the same unborn, eternal form of bliss and 
knowledge, changeless in His transcendental body a�d intelligence. Fac­
tually, His appearance and disappearance is like the sun's rising, moving 
before us, and then disappearing from our eyesight. When the sun is out 
of sight, we think that the sun is set, and when the sun is before our eyes, 
we think that the sun is on the ·horizon. Actually, the sun is always in its 
fixed position, but owing to our defective, insufficient senses, we calcu­
late the appearance and disappearance of the sun in the sky. And, because 
His appearance and disappearance are completely different from that of 
any ordinary, common living entity, it is evident that He is eternal, blissful 
knowledge by His internal potency-and He is never contaminated by 
material nature. The Vedas also confirm that the Supreme Personality 
of Godhead is unborn, yet He still appears to take His birth in multi­
manifestations. The Vedic supplementary literatures also confirm that 
even though the Lord appears to be taking His birth, He is still without 
change of body. In the Bhiigavatam, He appears before His mother as 
Narayava, with four hands and the decorations of the six kinds of full 
opulences. His appearance in His original eternal form is His causeless 
mercy, according to the Visvakosa dictionary. The Lord is conscious of all 
of His previous appearances and disappearances, but a common living 
entity forgets everything about his past body as soon as he gets another 
body. He is. the Lord of all living entities because He performs wonderful 
and superhuman activities while He is on this earth. Therefore, the Lord is 
always the same Absolute Truth and is without differentiation between His 
form and self, or between His quality and body. A question may now be 
raised as to why the Lord appears and disappears in this world. This is 
explained in the next verse.

TRANSLATION 
Whenever and wherever there is a decline in religious practice, 0

PURPORT 
The word srjiimi is significant herein. Srjiimi cannot be used in the sense 
of creation, because, according to the previous verse, there is no creation 
of the Lord's form or body, since all of the forms are eternally existent. 
Therefore, srjiimi means that the Lord manifests Himself as He is. Although 
the Lord appears on schedule, namely at the end of Dvapara-yuga of the 
twenty-eighth millennium of the eighth Manu, in one day of Brahma, 
still He has no obligation to adhere to such rules and regulations because 
He is completely free to act in many ways at His will. He therefore 
appears by His own will whenever there is a predominance of irreligiosity 
and a disappearance of true religion. Principles of religion are laid down 
in the Vedas, and any discrepancy in the matter of properly executing 
the rules of the Vedas makes one irreligious. In the Bhiigavatam it is 
stated that such principles are the laws of the Lord. Only the Lord can 
manufacture a system of religion. The 
Vedas are also accepted 
as 
originally spoken by the Lord Himself to Brahma, from within his heart. 
Therefore, the principles of dharma, or religion, are the direct orders of the 
Supreme Personality of Godhead (dharmam tu siik§iit-bhagavat-prapitam). 
These principles are clearly indicated throughout the Bhagavad-gitii. The 
purpose of the Vedas is to establish such principles under the order of the 
Supreme Lord, and the Lord directly orders, at the end of the Gitii, that 
l 
Text 8] 
Transcendental Knowledge 
225 
the highest principle 
of religion is to surrender unto Him only, and 
nothing more. The Vedic principles push one towards complete surrender 
unto Him; and, whenever such principles are disturbed by the demonic, 
the 
Lord appears. 
From the Bhiigavatam we understand that Lord 
Buddha is the incarnation of Kr�Qa who appeared when materialism was 
rampant and materialists were using the pretext of the authority of the 
Vedas. Although there are certain restrictive rules and regulations regard­
ing animal sacrifice for particular purposes in the Vedas, people of 
demonic tendency still took to animal sacrifice without reference to the 
Vedic principles. Lord Buddha appeared to stop this nonsense and to 
establish the Vedic principles of nonviolence. Therefore each and every 
avatiira, or incarnation of the Lord, has a particular mission, and they are 
all described in the revealed scriptures. No one should be accepted as an 
avatiira unless he is referred to by scriptures. It is not a fact that the Lord 
appears only on Indian soil. He can advent Himself anywhere and every­
where, and whenever He desires to appear. In each and every incarnation, 
He speaks as much about religion as can be understood by the particular 
people under their particular circumstances. But the mission is the same­
to lead people to God 
'
consciousness and obedience to the principles of 
religion. Sometimes He descends personally, and sometimes He sends His 
bona fide representative in the form of His son, or servant, or Himself in 
some disguised form. 
The principles of the Bhagavad-gita were spoken to Arjuna, and, for 
that matter, to other highly elevated persons, because he was highly 
advanced compared to ordinary persons in other parts of the world. Two 
plus two equals four is a mathematical principle that is true both in the 
beginner's arithmetic class and in the advanced class as well. Still, there are 
higher and lower mathematics. In all incarnations of the Lord, therefore, 
the same principles are taught, but they appear to be higher and lower in 
varied circumstances. The higher principles of religion begin with the 
acceptance of the four orders and the four statuses of social life, as will 
be explained later. The whole purpose of the mission of incarnations is 
to arouse Kr�Qa consciousness everywhere. Such consciousness is manifest 
and nonmanifest only under different circumstances.

In order to deliver the pious and to annihilate the miscreants, as well as

PURPORT 
According to Bhagavad-gitii, a siidhu (holyman) is a man in Kr�pa 
consciousness. A person may appear to be irreligious, but if he has the 
qualifications of Kr�pa co,nsciousness wholly and fully, he is to be under­
stood to be a siidhu. And du§krtam applies to one who doesn't care for 
Kr�Q.a consciousness. Such miscreants, or du§krtam, are described as foolish 
and the lowest of mankind, even though they may be decorated with 
mundane education; whereas another person, who is one hundred percent 
engaged in Kr�Q.a consciousness, is accepted as siidhu, even though such a 
person may neither be learned nor well cultured. As far as the atheistic are 
concerned, it is not necessary for the Supreme Lord to appear as He is to 
destroy them, as He did with the demons Ravapa and Kamsa. The Lord 
has many agents who are quite competent to vanquish demons. But the 
Lord especially descends to appease His unalloyed devotees, who are 
always harassed by the demonic. The demon harasses the devotee, even 
though the latter may happen to be his kin. Although Prahlada Maharaja 
was the son of Hirapyakasipu, he was nonetheless persecuted by his father; 
although Devaki, the mother of Kr�pa, was the sister of Kamsa, she and 
her husband Vasudeva were persecuted only because Kr�pa was to be 
born of them. So Lord Kr�pa appeared primarily to deliver Devaki, rather 
than kill Kanisa, but both were performed simultaneously. Therefore it is 
said here that to deliver the devotee and vanquish the demon miscreants, 
the Lord appears in different incarnations. 
In the Caitanya-caritiimrta of Kr�padasa Kaviraja, the following verses 
summarize these principles of incarnation: 
Text 9] 
Transcendental Knowledge 
sr�ti-hetu yei miirti prapaiice avatare 
sei isvara-miirti 'avatiira' niima dhare 
miiyiitita paravyome saviira avasthiina 
visve 'avatari' dhare 'avatiira' niima. 
227 
"The avatiira, or incarnation of Godhead, descends from the kingdom of 
God for material manifestation. And the particular form of the Personality 
of Godhead who so descends is called an incarnation, or avatiira. St!ch 
incarnations are situated in the spiritual world, the kingdom of God. When 
they descend to the material creation, they assume the name avatiira." 
There are various kinds of avatiiras, such as puru�iivatiiras, guriivatiiras, 
liliivatiiras, saktyiivesa avatiiras, manvantara-avatiiras and yugiivatiiras-all 
appearing on schedule all over the universe. But Lord Kr�pa is the primeval 
Lord, the fountainhead of all avatiiras. Lord Sri Kr�pa descends for the 
specific purposes of mitigating the anxieties of the pure devotees, who 
are very anxious to see Him in His original Vrndavana pastimes. Therefore, 
the prime purpose of the Kr�pa avatiira is to satisfy His unalloyed devotees. 
The Lord says that He incarnates Himself in every millennium. This 
indicates that He incl;lrnates also in the age of Kali. As stated in the 
Srimad-Bhiigavatam, the incarnation in the age of Kali is Lord Caitanya 
Mahaprabhu, who spread the worship of Kr�Q.a by the sankirtana move­
ment (congregational chanting of the holy names), and spread Kf�pa 
consciousness throughout India. He predicted that this culture of sankirtana 
would be broadcast all over the world, from town to town and village to 
village. Lord Caitanya as the incarnation of Kf�pa, the Personality of 
Godhead, is described secretly but not directly in the confidential 
parts of the revealed scriptures, such as the Upan�ads, Mahiibhiirata, 
Bhiigavatam, etc. The devotees of Lord Kr�pa are much attracted by the 
sahkirtana movement of Lord Caitanya. This avatiira of the Lord does not 
kill the miscreants, but delivers them by the causeless mercy of the Lord.

TRANSLATION 
One who knows the transcendental nature of My appearance and activi­
ties does not, upon leaving the body, take his birth again in this material 
world, but attains My eternal abode, 0 Arjuna. 
PURPORT 
The Lord's descent from His transcendental abode is already explained 
in the 6th verse. One who can understand the truth of the appearance of 
the Personality of Godhead is already liberated from material bondage, and 
therefore he returns to the kingdom of God immediately after quitting 
this present material body. Such liberation of the living entity from ma­
terial bondage is not at all easy. The impersonalists and the yogis attain 
liberation only after much trouble and many, many births. Even then, the 
liberation they achieve-merging into the impersonal brahmajyoti of the 
Lord-is only partial, and there is the risk of returning again to this ma­
terial world. But the devotee, simply by understanding the transcendental 
nature of the body and activities of the Lord, attains the abode of the 
Lord after ending this body and does not run the risk of returning again 
to this material world. In the Brahma-samhitii it is stated that the Lord has 
many, many forms and incarnations: advaitam acyutam aniidim ananta­
riipam. Although there are many transcendental forms of the Lord, they 
are still one and the same Supreme Personality of Godhead. One has to 
understand this fact with conviction, although it is incomprehensible to 
mundane scholars and empiric philosophers. As stated in the Vedas: 
eko devo nitya-liliinurakto bhakta-vyiipi hrdy antariitmii. 
"The one Supreme Personality of Godhead is eternally engaged in many, 
many transcendental· forms in relationships with His unalloyed devotees." 
This Vedic version is confirmed in this verse of the Gitii personally by the 
Lord. He who accepts this truth on the strength of the authority of the 
Vedas and of the Supreme Personality of Godhead and who does not waste 
time in philosophical speculations attains the highest perfectional stage of 
liberation. Simply by accepting this truth on faith, one can, without a 
doubt, attain liberation. The Vedic version, "tattvamasi," is actually applied 
j 
f 
Text 10] 
Transcendental Knowledge 
229 
in this case. Anyone who understands Lord Kr�l).a to be the Supreme, or 
who says unto the Lord, "You are the same Supreme Brahman, the Per· 
sonality of Godhead" is certainly liberated instantly, and consequently his 
entrance into the transcendental association of the Lord is guaranteed. In 
other words, such a faithful devotee of the Lord attains perfection, and 
this is confirmed by the following Vedic assertion: 
tam eva viditviitimrtyumeti niinya{t panthii vidyate ayanaya. 
One can attain the perfect stage of liberation from birth and death simply 
by knowing the Lord, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. There is no 
alternative because anyone who does not understand Lord Kr�l).a as the 
Supreme Personality of Godhead is surely in the mode of ignorance. Con­
sequently he will not attain salvation, simply, so to speak, by licking the 
outer surface of the bottle of honey, or by interpreting the Bhagavad-gitii 
according to mundane scholarship. Such empiric philosophers may assume 
very important roles in the material world, but they are not necessarily 
eligible for liberation. Such puffed up mundane scholars have to wait for 
the causeless mercy of the devotee of the Lord. One should therefore

PURPORT 
As described above, it is very difficult for a person who is too materially 
affected to understand the personal nature of the Supreme Absolute Truth. 
Generally, people who are attached to the bodily conception of life are so 
absorbed in materialism that it is almost impossible for them to understand 
that there is a transcendental body which is imperishable, full of know­
ledge and eternally blissful. In the materialistic concept, the body is perish­
able, full of ignorance and completely miserable. Therefore, people in 
general keep this same bodily idea in mind when they are informed of the 
personal form of the Lord. For such materialistic men, the form of the 
gigantic material manifestation is supreme. Consequently they consider the 
Supreme to be impersonal. And because they are too materially absorbed, 
the conception of retaining the personality after liberation from matter 
frightens them. When they are informed that spiritual life is also individual 
and personal, they become afraid of becoming persons again, and so they 
naturally prefer a kind of merging into the impersonal void. Generally� 
they compare the living entities to the bubbles of the ocean, which merge 
into the ocean. That is the highest perfection of spiritual existence attain­
able without individual personality. This is a kind of fearful stage of life, 
devoid of perfect knowledge of spiritual existence. Furthermore there are 
many persons who cannot understand spiritual existence at all. Being 
embarassed by so many theories and by contradictions of various types of 
philosophical speculation, they become disgusted or angry and foolishly 
conclude that there is no supreme cause and that everything is ultimately 
void. Such people are in a diseased condition of life. Some people are too 
materially attached and therefore do not give attention to spiritual life, 
some of them want to merge into the supreme spiritual caus�, and some of 
them disbelieve in everything, being angry at all sorts of spiritual specula­
tion out of hopelessness. This last class of men take to the shelter of some 
kind of intoxication, and their affective hallucinations are sometimes 
accepted as spiritual vision. One has to get rid of all three stages of attach­
ment to the material world: negligence of spiritual life, fear of a spiritual 
personal identity, and the conception of void that underlies the frustration 
of life. To get free from these three stages of the material concept of life, 
one has to take complete shelter of the Lord, guided by the bona fide 
spiritual master, and follow the disciplines and regulative principles of 
11 
I 
Text 11] 
Transcendental Knowledge 
231 
devotional life. The last stage of the devotional life is called bhiiva, or 
transcendental love of Godhead. 
According to Bhakti-rasiimrta-sindhu, the science of devotional service: 
iidau sraddhii tatap siidhu-sango 'tha bhajana-kriyii 
tato 'nartha-nivrttip syiit tato ni§thii rucis tatap 
athiisaktis tato bhiivas tatap premiibhyudaiicati 
. 
siidhakiiniim ayam premr-afl priidurbhiive bhavet kramap. 
"In the beginning one must have a preliminary desire for self-realization. 
This will bring one to the stage of trying to associate with persons who are 
spiritually elevated. In next stage one becomes initiated by an elevated 
spiritual master, and under his instruction the neophyte devotee begins the 
process of devotional serVIce. By execution of devotional service under the 
guidance of the spiritual master, one becomes free from all material attach­
ment, attains steadiness in self-realization, and acquires a taste for hearing 
about the Absolute Personality of Godhead, Sri Kr�!J.a. This taste leads one 
further forward to attachment for Kr�!la consciousness, which is matured 
in bhiiva, or the preliminary stage of transcendental love of God. Real love 
for God is called premii, the highest perfectional stage of life." In the premii 
stage there is constant engagement in the transcendental loving service of 
the Lord. So, by the slow process of devotional service, under the guidance 
of the bona fide spiritual master, one can attain the highest stage, being 
freed from all material attachment, from the fearfulness of one's individual 
spiritual personality, and from the frustrations resulting from void phi­
losophy. Then one can ultimately attain to the abode of the Supreme Lord.

PURPORT 
Everyone is searching for Kr��a in the different aspects of His manifes­
tations. Kr��a, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, is partially realized 
in His impersonal brahmajyoti effulgence and as the all-pervading Super­
soul dwelling within everything, including the particles of atoms. But 
Kr��a is only fully realized by His pure
, 
devotees. Consequently, Kr��a is 
the object of everyone's realization, and thus anyone and everyone is 
satisfied according to one's desire to have Him. In the transcendental world 
also., Kr��a reciprocates with His pure devotees in the transcendental 
attitude, just as the devotee wants Him. One devotee may want Kr��a as 
supreme master, another as his personal friend, another as his son, and still 
another as his lover. Kr��a rewards all the devotees equally, according to 
their different intensities of love for Him. In the material world, the 
same reciprocations of feelings are there, and they are equally ex­
changed by the Lord with the different types of worshipers. The pure 
devotees both here and in the transcendental abode associate with Him in 
person and are able to render personal service to the Lord and thus derive 
transcendental bliss in His loving service. As for those who are imper­
sonalists and who want to commit spiritual suicide by annihilating the 
individual existence of the living entity, Kr��a helps also by absorbing 
them into His effulgence. Such impersonalists do not agree to accept the 
eternal, blissful Personality of Godhead; consequently they cannot relish 
the bliss of transcendental personal service to the Lord, having extinguished 
their individuality. Some of them, who are not situated even in the imper­
sonal existence, return to this material field to exhibit their dormant 
desires for activities. They are not admitted in the spiritual planets, but 
they are again given a chance to act on the material planets. For those 
who are fruitive workers, the Lord awards the desired results of their 
prescribed duties, as the yajnesvara; and those who are yogis seeking 
mystic powers are awarded such powers. In other words, everyone is 
dependent for success upon His mercy alone, and all kinds of spiritual

processes are but different degrees of success on the same path. Unless, 
therefore, one comes to the highest perfection of Kr�I;J.a consciousness, all 
attempts remain imperfect, as is stated in the Srimad-Bhiigavatam: 
akiima� saroa-kiimo vii mok�a-kiima udiiradhi[t 
tivrep.a bhakti-yogena yajeta puru�am param 
"Whether one is without desire [the condition of the devotees], or is 
desirous of all fruitive results, or is after liberation, one should with all 
efforts try to worship the Supreme Personality of Godhead for complete 
perfection, culminating in Kf�I;J.a consciousness." (Bhiig. 2.3 .10)

PURPORT 
There is a great misconception about the gods or demigods of this 
material world, and men of less intelligence, although passing as great 
scholars, take these demigods to be various forms of the Supreme Lord. 
Actually, the demigods are not different forms of God, but they are God's

different parts and parcels. God is one, and the parts and parcels are many. 
The Vedas say, nityo nityiiniim: God is one. Isvaraft paramaft k[$llaft. The 
Supreme God is one-Krwa-and the demigods are delegated with powers 
to manage this material world. These demigods are all living entities 
(nityiiniim) with different grades of material power. They cannot be equal 
to the Supreme God-Narayal).a, Vi�IJU, or Kr�IJa. Anyone who thinks that 
God and the demigods are on the same level is called an atheist, or 
pii$a[ll)i. Even the great demigods like Brahma and Siva cannot be com-
\ 1 
pared to the Supreme L?rd. In fact, the Lord is worshiped by demigods 
I ! 
such as Brahma and Siva (siva-virinci-nutam ). Yet curiously enough 
there are many human leaders who are worshiped by foolish men under 
the misunderstanding of anthropomorphism or zoomorphism. Iha devatiift 
denotes a powerful man or demigod of this material world. But Narayapa, 
Vi�pu or Kr�pa, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, does not belong to 
11 
this world. He is above, or transcendental to, material creation. Even 
!. 
Sri'pada Saitkaracarya, the leader of the impersonalists, maintains that 
Narayapa, or K�pa, is beyond this material creation. However, foolish 
·people (hrt-anjana) worship the demigods because they want immediate 
results. They get the results, but do not know that results so obtained are 
temporary and are meant for less intelligent persons. The intelligent person 
is in Kr�pa consciousness, and he has no need to worship the paltry demi­
gods for some immediate, temporary benefit. The demigods of this mate­
rial world, as well as their worshipers, will vanish with the annihilation of 
this material world. The boons of the demigods are material and temporary. 
Both the material worlds and their inhabitants, including the demigods, and 
their worshipers, are bubbles in the cosmic ocean. In this world, however, 
human society is mad after temporary things such as the material opulence 
of possessing land, family and enjoyable paraphernalia. To achieve such 
temporary things, they worship the demigods or powerful men in human 
society. If a man gets some ministership in the government by worshiping 
a political leader, he considers that he has achieved a great boon. All of 
them are therefore kowtowing to the so-called leaders or "big guns" in 
order to achieve temporary boons, and they indeed achieve such things. 
Such foolish men are not interested in Kr�pa consciousness for the per­
manent solution to the hardships of material existence. They are all after 
sense enjoyment, and to get a little facility for sense enjoyment they are 
attracted to worship empowered living entities known as demigods. This 
verse indicates that people are rarely interested in Kr�va consciousness. 
They are mostly interested in material enjoyment, and therefore they 
worship some powerful living entity.

TRANSLATION 
According to the three modes of material nature and the work ascribed 
to them, the four divisions of human society were created by Me. And, 
although I am the creator of this system, you should know that I am yet 
the non-doer, being unchangeable. 
PURPORT 
The Lord is the creator of everything. Everything is born of Him, every­
thing is sustained by Him, and everything, after annihilation, rests in Him. 
He is therefore the creator of the four divisions of the social order, begin­
ning with the intelligent class of men, technically called briihmartas due to 
their being situated in the mode of goodness. Next is the administrative 
class, technically called the k§aflriyas due to their being situated in the 
mode of passion. The mercantile men, called the vaisyas, are situated in 
the mixed modes of passion and ignorance, and the sudras, or laborer class, 
are situated in the ignorant mode of material nature. In spite of His cre­
ating the four divisions of human society, Lord Kr�!la does not belong to 
any of these divisions, because He is not one of the conditioned souls, a 
section of whom form human society. Human society is similar to any 
other animal society, but to elevate men from the animal status, the above­
mentioned divisions are created by the Lord for the systematic develop­
ment of Kr�!la consciousness. The tendency of a particular man toward 
work is determined by the modes of material nature which he has acquired. 
236 
Bhagavad-gita As It Is 
[Ch. 4 
Such symptoms of life, according to different modes of material nature, 
are described in the Eighteenth Chapter of this book. A person in Kr�Fa 
consciousness, however, is above even the briihma"{las, because a briihma"{la 
by quality is supposed to know about Brahman, the Supreme Absolute 
Truth. Most of them approach the impersonal Brahman manifestation of 
Lord Kr�J)a, but only a man who transcends the limited knowledge of a 
briihma"{la and reaches the knowledge of the Supreme Personality of God­
head, Lord Sri Kr�J)a, becomes a person in Kr�J)a consciousness-or, in 
other words, a Vai§"{lava. Kr�l)a consciousness includes knowledge of all 
different plenary expansions of Kf�J)a, namely Rama, Nrsimha, V araha, etc. 
However, as Kr�l)a is transcendental to this system of the four divisions of 
human society, a person in Kr�l)a consciousness is also transcendental to 
all divisions "of human society, whether we consider the divisions of com­
munity, nation or species.

similarly the Lord, although He is the creator of this material world, is not 
affected by the activities of the material world. He creates and remains 
aloof from the creation, whereas the living entities are entangled in the 
fruitive results of material activities because of their propensity for lording 
it over material resources. The proprietor of an establishment is not respon­
sible for the right and wrong activities of the workers, but the workers are 
themselves responsible. The living entities are engaged in their respective 
activities of seuse gratification, and these activities are not ordained by the 
Lord. For advancement of sense gratification, the living entities are engaged 
in the work of this world, and they aspire to heavenly happiness after 
death. The Lord, being full in Himself, has no attraction for so-called 
heavenly happiness. The heavenly demigods are only His engaged servants. 
The proprietor never desires the low-grade happiness such as the workers 
may desire. He is aloof from the material actions and reactions. For exam­
ple, the rains are not responsible for different types of vegetation that 
appear on the earth, although without such rains there is no possibility of 
vegetative growth. Vedic smrti confirms this fact as follows: 
nimitta-miitram eviisau srjyiiniim sarga-karmar-i 
pradhiina-kiirar-i-bhiitii yato vai s[jya-saktaya{l. 
In the material creations, the Lord is only the supreme cause. The 
immediate cause is material nature by which the cosmic manifestation is 
visible. The created beings are of many varieties, such as the demigods, 
human beings and lower animals, and all of them are subject to the reac­
tions of their past good or bad activities. The Lord only gives them the 
proper facilities for such activities and the regulations of the modes of 
nature, but He is never responsible for their past and present activities. In 
the Vediinta-siitras it is confirmed that the Lord is never partial to any 
living entity. The living entity is responsible for his own acts. The Lord 
only gives him facilities, through the agency of material nature, the exter­
nal energy. Anyone who is fully conversant with all the intricacies of this 
law of karma, or fruitive activities, does not become affected by the results 
of his activities. In other words, the person who understands this transcen­
dental nature of the Lord is an experienced man in Kr�!la consciou�mess, 
and thus he is never subjected to the laws of karma. One who does not 
know the transcendental nature of the Lord and who thinks that the 
activities of the Lord are aimed at fruitive results, as are the activities of 
the ordinary living entities, certainly becomes entangled himself in fruitive 
reaction. But one who knows the Supreme Truth is a liberated soul fixed in 
Kr�!la consciousness.

All the liberated souls in ancient times acted with this understanding

PURPORT 
There are two classes of men. Some of them are full of polluted material 
things within their hearts, and some of them are materially free. Kr�pa 
consciousness is equally beneficial for both of these persons. Those who are 
full of dirty things can take to the line of Kr�pa consciousness for a gradual 
cleansing process, following the regulative principles of devotional service. 
Those who are already cleansed of the impurities may continue to act in 
the same Kr�pa consciousness so that others may follow their exemplary 
activities and thereby be benefitted. Foolish persons or neophytes in Kr�pa 
consciousness often want to retire from activities without having know­
ledge of Kr�J)a consciousness. Arjuna 's desire to retire from activities on 
the battlefield was not approved by the Lord. One need only know how to 
act. To retire from the activities of Kr�J)a consciousness and to sit aloof 
making a show of Kr�J)a consciousness, is less important than actually en­
gaging in the field of activities for the sake of Kr�J)a. Arjuna is here advised 
to act in Kr�J)a consciousness, following in the footsteps of the Lord's 
previous disciples, such as the sun-god Vivasvan, as mentioned herein-

before. The Supreme Lord knows all His past activities, as well as those of 
persons who acted in Kr�I]a consciousness in the past. Therefore He recom­
mends the acts of the sun-god, who learned this art from the Lord some 
millions of years before. All such students of Lord Kf�I]a are mentioned 
here as past liberated persons, engaged in the discharge of duties allotted 
by Kr�I]a.

Action in Kpg1a consciousness has to be executed in accord with the 
examples of previous bona fide devotees. This is recommended in the 15th 
verse. Why such action should not be independent will be explained inthe 
text to follow. 
To act in Kr�I]a consciousness, one has to follow the leadership of 
authorized persons who are in a line of disciplic succession as explained 
in the beginning of this chapter. The system of Kr�I]a consciousness was 
first narrated to the sun-god, the sun-god explained it to his son Manu, 
! ' 
II\ 
240 
Bhagavad-g1ta As It Is 
[Ch. 4 
Manu explained it to his son Ik�vaku, and the system is current on this 
earth from that very remote time. Therefore, one has to follow in the foot­
steps of previous authorities in the line of disciplic succession. Otherwise 
even the most intelligent men will be bewildered regarding the standard 
actions of Kr�r;ta consciousness. For this reason, the Lord decided to 
instruct Atjuna in Kr�r;ta consciousness directly. Because of the direct in­
struction of the Lord to Atjuna, anyone who follows in the footsteps of 
Atjuna is certainly not bewildered. 
It is said that one cannot ascertain the ways of religion simply by imper­
fect experimental knowledge. Actually, the principles of religion can only 
be laid down by the Lord Himself. Dharmam hi siik§iit-bhagavat-praritam. 
·No one can manufacture a religious principle by imperfect speculation. 
One must follow in the footsteps of great authorities like Brahma, Siva, 
Narada, Manu, Kumara, Kapila, Prahlada, Bhi�ma, Sukadeva Gosvami, 
Yamaraja, Janaka, etc. By mental speculation one cannot ascertain what 
is religion or self-realization. Therefore, out of causeless mercy to His devo­
tees, the Lord explains directly to Arjuna what action is and what inac­
tion is. Only action performed in Kr�l).a consciousness can deliver a person 
from the entanglement of material existence.

PURPORT 
If one is serious about liberation from material bondage, o
'
ne has to 
understand the distinctions between action, inaction and unauthorized 
actions. One has to apply oneself to such an analysis of action, reaction 
and perverted actions because it is a very difficult subject matter. To under­
stand Kr�pa consciousness and action according to the modes, one has 
to learn one's relationship with the Supreme; i.e., one who has learned 
perfectly knows that every living entity is the eternal servitor of the Lord 
and that consequently one has to act in Kr�pa consciousness. The entire 
Bhagavad-gitii is directed toward this conclusion. Any other conclusions, 
against this consciousness and its attendant reactiohs, are vikarmas, or 
prohibitive actions. To understand all this one has to associate with 
authorities in Kr�pa consciousness and learn the secret from them; this is 
as good as learning from the Lord directly. Otherwise, even the most 
intelligent·person will be bewildered.

PURPORT 
A person acting in Kr��a consciousness is naturally free from the bonds 
of karma. His activities are all performed for Kr��a; therefore he does not 
enjoy or suffer any of the effects of work. Consequently he is intelligent 
in human society, even though he is engaged in all sorts of activities for 
Kr�n.a. A karma means without reaction to work. The impersonalist ceases 
fruitive activities out of fear, so that the resultant action may not be a 
stumbling block on the path of self-realization, but the personalist knows 
rightly his position as the eternal servitor of the Supreme Personality 
of Godhead. Therefore he engages himself in the activities of Kr��a 
_ consciousness. Because everything is done for Kr��a, he enjoys only 
transcendental happiness in the discharge of this service. Those who are 
engaged in this process are known to be without desire for personal sense 
gratification. The sense of eternal servitorship to Kr��a makes one immune 
to all sorts of reactionary elements of work.

PURPORT 
Only a person in full knowledge can understand the activities of a person 
in Kr�!la consciousness. Because the person in Kr�!la consciousness is 
devoid of all kinds of sense-gratificatory propensities, it is to be understood 
that he has burned up the reactions of his work by perfect knowledge of 
his constitutional position as the eternal servitor of the Supreme Per­
sonality of Godhead. He is actually learned who has attained to such 
perfection of knowledge. Development of this knowledge of the eternal 
servitorship of the Lord is compared to fire. Such a fire, once kindled, can 
burn up all kinds of reactions to work.

Abandoning all attachment to the results of his activities, ever satisfied

kinds of undertakings. 
· 
PURPORT 
This freedom from the bondage of actions is possible only in Kr�!la 
consciousness when one is doing everything for Kr�!J.a. A Kr�!la conscious 
person acts out of pure love for the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and 
therefore he has no attraction for the results of the action. He is not even 
I· 
244 
Bhagavad-gita As It Is 
[Ch. 4 
attached to his personal maintenance, for everything is left to Kr�!la. Nor 
is he anxious to secure things, nor to protect things already in his pos� 
session. He does his duty to his best ability and leaves everything to Kr�!la. 
Such an unattached person is always free from the resultant reactions of 
good and bad; it is as though he were not doing anything. This is the sign 
of akarma, or actions without fruitive reactions. Any other action, there­
fore, devoid of Kr�!la consciousness, is binding upon the worker, and that 
is the real aspect of vikarma, as explained hereinbefore.

PURPORT 
A Kr�J.la conscious person does not expect good or bad results in his 
activities. His mind and intelligence are fully controlled. He knows that he 
is part and parcel of the Supreme, and therefore the part played by him, 
as a part and parcel of the whole, is not his by choice hut is chosen for 
him by the Supreme and is done only through His agency. When the hand 
Text 22] 
Transcendental Knowledge 
245 
moves, it does not move out of its own accord, but by the endeavor of 
the whole body. A Kr�l)a conscious person is always dovetailed with the 
supreme desire, for he has no desire for personal sense gratification. He 
moves exactly like a part of a machine. As a machine part requires oiling 
and cleaning for maintenance, similarly, a Kr�l)a conscious man maintains 
himself by his work just to remain fit for action in the transcendental 
loving service of the Lord. He is therefore immune to all the reactions of 
his endeavors. Like an animal, he has no proprietorship even over his own 
body. A cruel proprietor of an animal sometimes kills the animal in his 
possession, yet the animal does not protest. Nor does it have any real 
independence. A Kr�l)a conscious person, fully engaged in self-realization, 
has very little time to falsely possess any material object. For maintaining 
body and soul, he does not require unfair means of accumulating money. 
He does not, therefore, become contaminated by such material sins. He is 
free from all reactions to his actions.

A Kr�r:ta conscious person does not make much endeavor even to 
maintain his body. He is satisfied with gains which are obtained of their

own accord. He neither begs nor borrows, but he labors honestly as far as 
is in his power, and is satisfied with whatever is obtained by his own honest 
labor. He is therefore independent in his livelihood. He does not allow 
anyone's service to hamper his own service in Kr�v.a consciousness. How­
ever, for the service of the Lord he can participate in any kind of action 
without being disturbed by the duality of the material world. The duality 
of the material world is felt in terms of heat and cold, or misery and 
happiness. A Kr�':la conscious person is above duality because he does not 
hesitate to act in any way for the satisfaction of Kr�v.a. Therefore he is 
steady both in success and in failure. These signs are visible when one is 
fully in transcendental knowledge.

Becoming fully Kr�':la conscious, one is freed from all dualities and thus 
is free from the contaminations of the material modes. He can become 
liberated because he knows his constitutional position in relationship with 
Kr�v.a; and thus his mind cannot be drawn from Kr�v.a consciousness.

Consequently, whatever he does, he does for K��a, who is the primeval

A person who is fully absorbed in Krli!l}a consciousness is sure to attain 
the spiritual kingdom because of his full contribution to spiritual activities, 
in which the consummation is absolute and that which is offered is of the 
same spiritual nature. 
PURPORT 
How activities in Kr��a consciousness can lead one ultimately to 
the spiritual goal is described here. There are various activities in Kf�l}a 
consciousness, and all of them will be described in the following verses. 
But, for the present, just the principle of Kr�va consciousness is de­
scribed. A conditioned soul, entangled in material contamination, is sure 
to act in the material atmosphere, and yet he has to get out of such an 
I 
.1·· 
r¥; 
248 
Bhagavad-gita As It Is 
[Ch. 4 
environment. The process by which the conditioned soul can get out of the 
material atmosphere is Kr��a consciousness. For example, a patient who is 
suffering from a disorder of the bowels due to overindulgence in milk 
products is cured by another milk product, namely curds. The materially 
absorbed conditioned soul can be cured by Kr��a consciousness as set 
forth here in the Gitii. This process is generally known as yajiia, or activi­
ties (sacrifices) simply meant for the satisfaction of Viwu or Kr��a. The 
more the activities of the material world are performed in Kr��a conscious­
ness, or for Vi��u only, the more the atmosphere becomes spiritualized by 
complete absorption. Brahman means spiritual. The Lord is spiritual, and 
the rays of His transcendental body are called brahmajyoti, His spiritual 
effulgence. Everything that exists is situated in that brahmajyoti, but when 
the jyoti is covered by illusion (miiyii) or sense gratification, it is called ma­
terial. This material veil can be remove.d at once by Kr��a consciousness; 
thus the offering for the sake of Kr��a consciousness, the consuming agent 
of such an offering or contribution, the process of consumption, the con­
tributor, and the result are-all combined together-Brahman, or the Ab­
solute Truth. The Absolute Truth covered by miiyii is called matter. 
Matter dqvetailed for the cause of the Absolute Truth regains its spiritual 
quality. Kr��a consciousness is the process of converting the illusory con­
sciousness into Brahman, or the Supreme. When the mind is fully absorbed 
in Kr��a consciousness, it is said to be in samiidhi, or trance. Anything 
done in such transcendental consciousness is called yajiia, or sacrifice for 
the Absolute. In that condition of spiritual consciousness, the contributor, 
the contribution, the consumption, the performer or leader of the perform­
ance, and the result or ultimate gain-everything-becomes one in the Ab­
solute, the Supreme Brahman. That is the method of Kr��a consciousness.

TRANSLATION 
Some yogis perfectly worship the demigods by offering different sacri­
fices to them, and some of them offer sacrifices in the fire of the Supreme 
Brahman. 
PURPORT 
As described above, a person engaged in discharging duties in Kr�!la 
consciousness is also called a perfect yogi or a first-class mystic. But there 
are others also, who perform similar sacrifices in the worship of demigods, 
and still others who sacrifice to the Supreme Brahman, or the impersonal 
feature of the Supreme Lord. So there are different kinds of sacrifices in 
terms of different categories. Such different categories of sacrifice by 
different types of performers only superficially demark varieties of sacri­
fice. Factual sacrifice means to satisfy the Supreme Lord, Viwu, who is 
also known as Y ajna. All the different varieties of sacrifice can be placed 
within two primary divisions: namely, sacrifice of worldly possessions and 
sacrifice in pursuit of transcendental knowledge. Those who are in Kr�!la 
consciousness sacrifice all material possessions for the satisfaction of the 
Supreme Lord, while others, who want some temporary material happiness, 
sacrifice their material possessions to satisfy demigods such as Indra, the 
sun-god, etc. And others, who are impersonalists, sacrifice their identity 
by merging into the existence of impersonal Brahman. The demigods are 
powerful living entities appointed by the Supreme Lord for the mainten­
ance and supervision of all material functions like the heating, watering 
and lighting of the universe. Those who are interested in material benefits 
worship the demigods by various sacrifices
· 
according to the Vedic rituals. 
They are called bahv-iSvara-viidi, or believers in many gods. But others, who 
worship the impersonal feature of the Absolute Truth and regard the 
forms of the demigods as temporary, sacrifice their individual selves in the 
supreme fire and thus end their individual existences by merging into the 
existence of the Supreme. �uch impersonalists spend their time in philo­
sophical speculation to understand the transcendental nature of the 
Supreme. In other words, the fruitive workers sacrifice their material 
possessions for material enjoyment, whereas the impersonalist sacrifices 
his material designations with a view to merging into the existence of the 
250 
Bhagavad-gita As It Is 
[Ch. 4 
Supreme. For the impersonalist, the fire altar of sacrifice is the Supreme 
Brahman, and the offering is the self being consumed by the fire of 
Brahman. The Kr�pa conscious person, like Arjuna, however, sacrifices 
everything for the satisfaction of Kr�pa, and thus all his material posses­
sions as well as his own self-everything-is sacrificed for Kr�pa. Thus, he is 
the first-class yogi; but he does not lose his individual existence.

Some of them sacrifice the hearing process and the senses in the fire of

PURPORT 
The four divisions of human life, namely the brahmaciiri, the grhastha, 
the viinaprastha, and the sannyiisi, are all meant to help men become 
perfect yogis or transcendentalists. Since human life is not meant for our 
enjoying sense gratification like the animals, the four orders of human life 
are so arranged that one may become perfect in spiritual life. The brahma­
ciiris, or students under the care of a bona fide spiritual master, control 
the mind by abstaining from sense gratification. They are referred to in 
this verse as sacrificing the hearing process and the senses in the fire of the 
controlled mind. A brahmaciiri hears only words concerning Kr�pa con-
Text 27] 
Transcendental Knowledge 
251 
·sciousness; hearing is the basic principle for understanding, and therefore 
the pure brahmaciiri engages fully in harer niimanukirtanam-chanting and 
hearing the glories of the Lord. He restrains himself from the vibrations of 
material sounds, and his hearing is engaged in the transcendental sound 
vibration of Hare Kr�va, Hare Kr�va. Similarly, the householders, who 
have some license for sense gratification, perform such acts with great 
restraint. Sex life, intoxication and meat eating are general tendencies of 
human society, but a regulated householder does not indulge in unrestricted 
sex life and other sense gratifications. Marriage on principles of religious 
life is therefore current in all civilized human society because that is the 
way for restricted sex life. This restricted, unattached sex life is also a kind 
of yajna because the restricted householder sacrifices his general tendency 
toward sense gratification for higher transcendental life.

The yoga system conceived by Pataiijali is referred to herein. In the 
Y oga-siitra of Pataiijali, the soul is called pratyag-iitma and parag-atmii As 
252 
Bhagavad-glta As It Is 
[Ch. 4 . 
long as the soul is attached to sense enjoyment, it is called parag-iitmii. The 
soul is subjected to the functions of ten kinds of air at work within the 
body, and this is perceived through the breathing system. The Patafi.jala 
system of yoga instructs one on how to control the functions of the body's 
air in a technical manner so that ultimately all the functions of the air 
within become favorable for purifying the soul of material attachment. 
According to this yoga system, pratyag iitmii is the ultimate goal. This 
pratyag iitmii is a withdrawal from activities in matter. The senses interact 
with the sense objects, like the ear for hearing, eyes for· seeing, nose for 
smelling, tongue for tasting, hand for touching, and all of them are thus 
engaged in activities outside the self. They are called the functions of the 
priipa -viiyu . The apiina -viiyu goes downwards, vyiina-viiyu acts to shrink 
and expand, samiina -viiyu adjusts equilibrium, udiina-viiyu goes upwards­
and when one is enlightened, one engages all these in searching for self­
realization.

PURPORT 
These sacrifices may be fitted into various divisions. There are persons 
who are sacrificing their possessions in the form of various kinds of 
charities. In India, the rich mercantile community or princely orders open 
various kinds of charitable institutions like dharmaSiila, anna-k§etra, 
atithi-siilii, anathalaya, vidyiipitha, etc. In other countries, too, there are 
many hospitals, old age homes and similar charitable foundations meant 
for distributing food, education and medical treatment free to the poor. 
All these charitable activities are called dravyamaya-yajna. There are others 
who, for higher elevation in life or for promotion to higher planets 
within the universe, voluntarily accept many kinds of austerities such as 
candriiyana and ciiturmiisya. These processes entail severe vows for con­
ducting life under certain rigid rules. For example, under the ciiturmiisya 
vow the candidate does not shave for four months during the year (July 
to October), he does not eat certain foods, does not eat twice in a day and 
does not leave home. Such sacrifice of the comforts of life is called 
tapomaya-yajfia. There are still others who engage themselves in different 
kinds of mystic yogas like the Patafijali system (for merging into the 
existence of the Absolute), or hatha-yoga or a§tiinga-yoga (for particular 
perfections). And some travel to all the sanctified places of pilgrimage. All 
these practices are called yoga-yajna, sacrifice for a certain type of per­
fection in the material world. There are others who engage themselves in 
the studies of different Vedic literatures, specifically the Upani§ads and 
Vediinta-siitras, 
or the siinkhya philosophy. 
All of these are called 
sviidhyiiya-yajna, or engagement in the sacrifice of studies. All these yogis 
are faithfully engaged in different types of sacrifice and are seeking a higher 
status of life. Kr�r;ta consciousness, is, however, different from these be­
cause it is the direct service of the Supreme Lord. Kr�r;ta consciousness 
cannot be attained by any one of the above-mentioned types of sacrifices 
but can be attained only by the mercy of the Lord and His bona fide 
devotee. Therefore, Kr�r;ta consciousness is transcendental.

TRANSLATION 
And there are even others who are inclined to the process of breath 
restraint to remain in trance, and they practice stopping the movement of 
the outgoing breath into the incoming, and incoming breath into the out­
going, and thus at last remain in trance, stopping all breathing. Some of 
them, curtailing the eating process, offer the outgoing breath into itself, as 
a sacrifice. 
PURPORT 
This system of yoga for controlling the breathing process is called priir-ii­
yiima, and in the beginning it is practiced in the hatha-yoga system through 
different sitting postures. All of these processes are recommended for con­
trolling the senses and for advancement in spiritual realization. This prac­
tice involves controlling the air within the body to enable simultaneous 
passage in opposite directions. The apiina air goes downward, and the priir-a 
air goes up. The priir-iiyiima yogi practices breathing the opposite way until 
the currents are neutralized into piiraka, equilibrium. Similarly, when the 
exhaled breathing is offered to inhaled breathing, it is called recaka. When 
both air currents are completely stopped, it is called kumbhaka-yoga. By 
practice of kumbhaka-yoga, the yogis increase the duration of life by 
. many, many years. A Krg�.a conscious person, however, being always 
situated in the transcendental loving service of the Lord, automatically 
becomes the controller of the senses. His. senses, being always engaged in 
,j 
Text 30] 
Transcendental Knowledge 
255 
the service of Kr�Q.a, have no chance of becoming otherwise engaged. So at 
the end of life, he is naturally transferred to the transcendental plane of 
Lord Kr�Q.a; consequently he makes no attempt to increase his longevity. 
He is at once raised to the platform of liberation. A Kr�Q.a conscious person 
begins from the transcendental stage, and he is constantly in that conscious­
ness. Therefore, there is no falling down, and ultimately he enters into the 
abode of the Lord without delay. The practice of reduced eating is auto­
matically done when one eats only Kr�Q.a prasiidam, or food which is 
offered first to the Lord. Reducing the eating process is very helpful in the 
matter of sense control. And without sense control there is no possibility 
of getting out of the material entanglement.

and performance of the yoga system), it is found that the common aim of 
all is to control the senses. Sense gratification is the root cause of material 
existence; therefore, unless and until one is situated on a platform apart 
from sense gratification, there is no chance of being elevated to the eternal 
platform of full knowledge, full bliss and full life. This platform is in the 
eternal atmosphere, or Brahman atmosphere. All the above-mentioned 
sacrifices help one to become cleansed of the sinful reactions of material 
existence. By this advancement in life, one not only becomes happy and 
opulent in this life, but also, at the end, he enters into the eternal kingdom 
of God, either merging into the impersonal Brahman or associating with 
the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Kr�l).a.

0 best of the Kuru dynasty, without sacrifice one can never live happily

PURPORT 
Whatever form of material existence one is in, one is invariably ignorant 
of his real situation. In other words, existence in the material world is due 
to the multiple reactions to our sinful lives. Ignorance is the cause of sinful 
life, and sinful life is the cause of one's dragging on in .material existence. 
The human form of life is the only loophole by which one may get out 
of this entanglement. The Vedas, therefore, give us a chance for escape by 
pointing out the paths of religion, economic comfort, regulated sense 
· gratification and, at last, the means to get out of the miserable condition 
entirely. The path of religion, or the different kinds of sacrifice recom-

mended above, automatically solves our economic problems. By perform­
ance of yajna we can have enough food, enough milk, etc.-even if there 
is a so-called increase of population. When the body is fully supplied, 
naturally the next stage is to satisfy the senses. The Vedas prescribe, there­
fore, sacred marriage for regulated sense gratification. Thereby one is gradu­
ally elevated to the platform of release from material bondage, and the 
highest perfection of liberated life is to associate with the Supreme Lord. 
Perfection is achieved by performance of yajna (sacrifice), as described 
above. Now, if a person is not inclined to perform yajna according to the 
Vedas, how can he expect a happy life? There are different grades of 
material comforts in different heavenly planets, and in all cases there is 
immense happiness for persons engaged in different kinds of yajna. But 
the highest kind of happiness that a man can achieve is to be promoted to 
the spiritual planets by practice of Kr�l)a consciousness. A life of Kr�l)a 
consciousness is therefore the solution to all the problems of material 
existence.

0 chastiser of the enemy, the sacrifice of knowledge is greater than the

PURPORT 
The purpose of all sacrifices is to arrive at the status of complete 
knowledge, then to gain release from material miseries, and, ultimately, 
to engage in loving transcendental service to the Supreme Lord (Kr�l).a 
consciousness). Nonetheless, there is a mystery about all these different 
activities of sacrifice, and one should know this mystery. Sacrifices 
sometimes take different forms according to the particular faith of the 
performer. When one's faith reaches the stage of transcendental knowledge, 
the performer of sacrifices should be considered more advanced than 
those who simply sacrifice material possessions without such knowledge, 
for without attainment of knowledge, sacrifices remain on the material 
platform and bestow no spiritual benefit. Real knowledge culminates in

259 
Kr�Q.a consciousness, the highest stage of transcendental knowledge. 
Without the elevation of knowledge, sacrifices are simply material activities. 
When, however, they are elevated to the level of transcendental knowledge, 
all such activities enter onto the spiritual platform. Depending on dif­
ferences in consciousness, sacrificial activities are sometimes called karma­
kiir-c}a, fruitive activities, and sometimes jiiiina-kar-cJa, knowledge in the 
pursuit of truth. It is better when the end is knowledge.

PURPORT 
The path of spiritual realization is undoubtedly difficult. The Lord 
therefore advises us to approach a bona fide spiritual master in the line of 
disciplic succession from the Lord Himself. No one can be a bona fide 
spiritual master without following this principle of disciplic succession.

Bhagavad-glta As It Is 
[Ch. 4 
The Lord is the original spiritual master, and a person in the disciplic 
succession can convey the message of the Lord as it is to his disciple. 
No one can be spiritually realized by manufacturing his own process, as is 
the fashion of the foolish pretenders. The Bhiigavatam says: dharmarh 
hi siik§iid-bhagavat-prar-itam-the path of religion is directly enunciated 
by the Lord. Therefore, mental speculation or dry arguments cannot help 
one progress in spiritual life. One has to approach a bona fide spiritual mas­
ter to receive the knowledge. Such a spiritual master should be accepted in 
full surrender, and one should serve the spiritual master like a menial ser­
vant, ·without false prestige. Satisfaction of the self-realized spiritual 
master is the secret of advancement in spiritual life. Inquiries and submission 
constitute the proper combination for spiritual understanding. Unless there 
is submission and service, inquiries from the learned spiritual master will 
not be effective. One must be able to pass the test of the spiritual master, 
and when he sees the genuine desire of the disciple, he automatically 
blesses the disciple with genuine spiritual understanding. In this verse, 
both blind following and absurd inquiries are condemned. One should 
not only hear submissively from the spiritual master, but one must also 
get a clear understanding from him, in submission and service and 
inquiries. A bona fide spiritual m_aster is by nature very kind toward the 
disciple. Therefore when the student is submissive and is always ready to 
render service, the reciprocation of knowledge and inquiries becomes 
perfect.

TRANSLATION 
And when you have thus learned the truth, you will know that all 
living beings are but part of Me-and that they are in Me, and are Mine. 
PURPORT 
The result of receiving knowledge from a self-realized soul, or one who 
. knows things as they are, is learning that all living beings are parts and 
parcels of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Lord Sri Kr�l)a. The sense 
of a separated existence from Kr�l)a is called maya (ma-not, ya-this). 
Some think that we have nothing to do with Kr�l)a, that Kr�l)a is only a 
great historical personality and that the Absolute is the impersonal 
Brahman. Factually, as it is stated in the Bhagavad-gita, this impersonal 
Brahman is the personal effulgence of Kr�l)a. Kr�l)a, as the Supreme Person­
ality of Godhead, is the cause of everything. In the Brahma-sarhhita it is 
clearly stated that Kr�l)a is the Supreme Personality of Godhead, the cause 
of all causes. Even the millions of incarnations are only His different 
expansions. Similarly, the living entities are also expansions of Kr�l)a. The 
Mayavadl philosophers wrongly think that Kr�l)a loses His own separate 
existence in His many expansions. This thought is material in nature. We 
have experience in the material world that a thing, when fragmentally 
distributed, loses its own original identity. But the Mayavadl philosophers 
fail to understand that Absolute means that one plus one is equal to one, 
and that one minus one is also equal to one. This is the case in the 
absolute world. 
For want of sufficient knowledge in the absolute science, we are now 
covered with illusion, and therefore we think that we are separate from 
Kr�\la. Although we are separated parts of Kr�\la, we are nevertheless not 
different from Him. The bodily difference of the living entities is maya, or 
not actual fact. We are all meant to satisfy Kr�\la. By maya alone Arjuna 
thought that the temporary bodily relationship with his kinsmen was more 
important than his eternal spiritual relationship with Kr�\la. The whole 
teaching of the Gita is targetted toward this end: that a living being, as His 
eternal servitor, cannot be separated from Kr�\la, and his sense of being an 
identity apart from Kr�\la is called maya. The living entities, as separate 
parts and parcels of the Supreme, have a purpose to fulfill. Having for­
gotten that purpose, since time immemorial they are situated in different 
bodies, as men, animals, demigods, etc. Such bodily differences arise from 
forgetfulness of the transcendental service of the Lord. But when one is

engaged in transcendental service through Kr�pa consciousness, one be­
comes at once liberated from this illusion. One can acquire such pure 
knowledge only from the bona fide spiritual master and thereby avoid the 
delusion that the living entity is equal to Kr�pa. Perfect knowledge is that 
the Supreme Soul, Kr�pa, is the supreme shelter for all living entities, and 
giving up such shelter, the living entities are deluded by the material energy, 
imagining themselves to have a separate identity. Thus, under different 
standards of material identity, they become forgetful of Krwa. When, 
however, such deluded living entities become situated in Kr�pa conscious­
ness, it is to be understood that they are on the path of liberation, as 
confirmed 
in 
the Bhiigavatam: 
muktir hitviinyathii riipam svariipera 
vyavasthiti[t. 
Liberation means to be situated in one's constitutional 
position as the eternal servitor of Kr�l).a (Kr�l).a consciousness).

which goes on in the ocean of nescience. This material world is sometimes 
regarded as an ocean of nescience and sometimes as a blazing forest. In the 
ocean, however expert a swimmer one may be, the struggle for existence is 
very severe. If someone comes forward and lifts the struggling swimmer 
from the ocean, he is the greatest savior. Perfect knowledge, received from 
the Supreme Personality of Godhead, is the path of liberation. The boat of 
Kr�l).a consciousness is very simple, but at the same time the most sublime.

Perfect knowledge of self and Superself and of their relationship is

activities, but also all reactions to pious activities, turning them to ashes. 
There are many stages of reaction: reaction in the making, reaction fructi­
fying, reaction already achieved, and reaction a priori. But knowledge of 
the constitutional position of the living entity burns everything to ashes. 
When one is in complete knowledge, all reactions, both a priori and 
a posteriori, are consumed. In the Vedas it is stated: ubhe uhaivai§a ete taraty

knowledge is the cause of our liberation. This knowledge is the mature 
fruit of devotional service, and when one is situated in transcendental 
knowledge, he need not search for peace elsewhere, for he enjoys peace 
within himself. In other words, this knowledge and peace are culminated 
in K�pa consciousness. That is the last word in the Bhagavad-gitii.

service, and by chanting "Hare Kr§ra, Hare Knra, Kr§!W K[§[La, Hare 
Hare/ Hare Riima, Hare Riima, Riima Riima, Hare Hare," which cleanses 
one's heart of all material dirt. Over and above this, one should control the

PURPORT 
Out of many 
standard and authoritative revealed scriptures, the 
Bhagavad-gita is the best. Persons who are almost like animals have no faith 
in, or knowledge of, the standard revealed scriptures; and some, even 
though they have knowledge of, or can cite passages from, the revealed 
scriptures, have actually no faith in these words. And even though others 
may have faith in scriptures like Bhagavad-gitii, they do not believe in or 
worship the Personality of Godhead, Sri Kr�J].a. Such persons cannot have 
any standing in Kr�J].a consciousness. They fall down. Out of all the above­
mentioned persons, those who have no faith and are always doubtful make 
no progress at all. Men without faith in God and His revealed word find no 
good in this world, nor in the next. For them there is no happiness what­
soever. One should therefore follow the principles of revealed scriptures 
with faith and thereby be raised to the platform of knowledge. Only this 
knowledge will help one become promoted to the transcendental platform 
of spiritual understanding. In other words, doubtful persons have no status 
whatsoever in spiritual emancipation. One should therefore follow in the 
footsteps of great ii.caryas who are in the disciplic succession and thereby 
attain success.

Bhagavad-glta As It Is 
[Ch. 4. 
PURPORT 
The yoga system instructed in this chapter is called sanii.tana-yoga, or 
eternal activities performed by the living entity. This yoga has two divisions 
of sacrificial actions: one is called sacrifice of one's material possessions, 
and the other is called knowledge of self, which is pure spiritual activity. 
If sacrifice of one's material possessions is not dovetailed for spiritual 
realization, then such sacrifice becomes material. But one who performs 
such sacrifices with a spiritual objective, or in devotional service, makes a 
perfect sacrifice. When we come to spiritual activities, we find that these 
are also divided into two: namely, understanding of one's own self (or 
one's constitutional position), and the truth regarding the Supreme Person­
ality of Godhead. One who follows the path of the Gitii. as it is. can very 
easily understand these two important divisions of spiritual knowledge. 
For him there is no difficulty in obtaining perfect knowledge of the self 
as part and parcel of the Lord. And such understanding is beneficial for 
such a person who easily understands the transcendental activities of the 
Lord. In the beginning of this chapter, the transcendental activities of the 
Lord were discussed by the Supreme Lord Himself. One who does not 
understand the instructions of the Gitii. is faithless, and is to be considered 
to be misusing the fragmental independence awarded to him by the Lord. 
In spite of such instructions, one who does not understand the real nature 
of the Lord as the eternal, blissful, all-knowing Personality of Godhead, is 
certainly fool number one. Ignorance can be removed by gradual accept­
ance of the principles of Kr�IJ.a consciousness. Kf�pa consciousness is 
awakened by different types of sacrifices to the demigods, sacrifice to 
Brahman, sacrifice in celibacy, in household life, in controlling the senses, 
in practicing mystic yoga, in penance, in foregoing material possessions, in 
studying the Vedas, and in partaking of tlie social institution called 
vaT(liistama-dharma. All of these are known as sacrifice, and all of them 
are based on regulated action. But within all these activities, the important 
factor is self-realization. One who seeks that objective is the real student of 
Bhagavad-gitii., but one who doubts the authority of Kr�:va falls back. 
One is therefore advised to study Bhagavad-gitii., or any other scripture, 
under a bona fide spiritual master, with service and surrender. A bona fide 
spiritual master is in the disciplic succession from time eternal, and he does 
not deviate at all from the instructions of the Supreme Lord as they were 
imparted millions of years ago to the sun-god, from whom the instructions 
of Bhagavad-gitii. have come down to the earthly kingdom. One should, 
therefore, follow the path of Bhagavad-gitii. as it is expressed in the Gitii.

·itself and beware of self-interested p(fople after personal aggrandizement 
who deviate others from the actual path. The Lord is definitely the · 
supreme person, and His activities are transcendental. One who understands 
this is a liberated person from the very beginning of his study of the Gita. 
Thus end the Bhaktivedanta Purports to the Fourth Chapter of the 
Srimad-Bhagavad-gita in the matter of Transcendental Knowledge.

[Ch. 5 · 
TRANSLATION 
Arjuna said: 0 Kr��a, first of all You ask me to renounce work, and 
then again You recommend work with devotion. Now will You kindly tell 
me definitely which of the two is more beneficial? 
PURPORT 
In this Fifth Chapter of the Bhagavad-gitii, the Lord says that work in 
devotional service is better than dry mental speculation. Devotional service 
is easier than the latter because, being transcendental in nature, it frees one 
from reaction. In the Second Chapter, preliminary knowledge of the soul 
and its entanglement in the material body were explained. How to get out 
of this material encagement by buddhi-yoga, or devotional service, was also 
explained therein. In the Third Chapter; it was explained that a person who 
is situated on the platform of knowledge no longer has any duties to 
perform. And, in the Fourth Chapter, the Lord told Arjuna that all kinds 
of sacrificial work culminate in knowledge. However, at the end of the 
Fourth Chapter, the Lord advised Arjuna to wake up and fight, being 
situated in perfect knowledge. Therefore, by simultaneously stressing the 
importance of both work in devotion and inaction in knowledge, Kr��a 
has perplexed Arjuna and confused his determination. Arjuna understands 
that renunciation in knowledge involves cessation of all kinds of work 
performed as sense activities. But if one performs work in devotional 
service, then how is work stopped? In other words, he thinks that 
sannyiisam, or renunciation in knowledge, should be altogether free from 
all kinds of activity because work and renunciation appear to him to be 
incompatible. He appears not to have understood that work in full know­
ledge is nonreactive and is therefore the same as inaction. He inquires, 
therefore, whether he should cease work altogether, or work with full 
knowledge.

TRANSLATION 
The Blessed Lord said: The renunciation of work and work in devotion 
are both good for liberation. But, of the two, work in devotional service is 
better than renunciation of works. 
PURPORT 
Fruitive activities (seeking sense gratification) are cause for material 
bondage. As long as one is engaged in activities aimed at improving the 
standard of bodily comfort, one is sure to transmigrate to different types 
of bodies, thereby continuing material bondage perpetually. Srimad­
Bhiigavatam confirms this as follows: 
niinam pramaUaft kurute vikarma yad-indriya-pritaya iiprrwti 
na siidhu manye yata iitmano 'yam asann api klesada iisa dehalt 
pariibhavas tiivad abodha-jiito yiivanna jijiiiisata iitma-tattvam 
yiivat kriyiis tiivad idam mano vai karmatmakam yena sarira-bandha� 
evam mana� karma va.Sam prayunkte avidyayiitmany upadhiyamiine 
pritir na yiivan mayi viisudeve. na mucyate deha-yogena· tiivat 
"People are mad after sense gratification, and they do not know that this 
present body, which is full of miseries, is a result of one's fruitive activities 
in the past. Although this body is temporary, it is always giving one 
trouble in many ways. Therefore, to act for sense gratification is not good. 
One is considered to be a failure in life as long as he makes no inquiry 
J 
j 
274 
Bhagavad-gita As It Is 
[Ch. 5 
· 
about the nature of work for fruitive results, for as long as one is engrossed 
in the consciousness of sense gratification, one has to transmigrate from 
one body to another. Although the mind may be engrossed in fruitive 
activities and influenced by ignorance, one must develop a love for devo­
tional service to Vasudeva. Only then can one have the opportunity to get 
out of the bondage of material existence." (Bhiig. 5.5.4-6) 
Therefore, jniina (or knowledge that one is not this material body but 
spirit soul) is not sufficient for liberation. One has to act in the status of 
spirit soul, otherwise there is no escape from material bondage. Action in 
Kr��a consciousness is not, however, action on the fruitive platform. 
Activities performed in full knowledge strengthen one's advancement in 
real knowledge. Without Kr��a consciousness, mere renunciation of fruitive 
activities does not actually purify the heart of a conditioned soul. As long 
as the heart is not purified, one has to work on the fruitive platform. But 
action in Kr��a consciousness automatically helps one escape the result of 
fruitive action so that one need not descend to the material platform. 
Therefore, action in Kr��a consciousness is always superior to renuncia­
tion, which always entails a risk of falling. Renunciation without Kr��a 
consciousness is incomplete, as is confirmed by Srila Riipa Gosvami in his 
Bhak ti-rasiimrta-sindhu. 
priipancikatayii buddhyii hari-sambandhi-vastunafl 
mumuk§ubhifl parityiigo vairiigyarh phalgu kathyate. 
"Renunciation by persons eager to achieve liberation of things which are 
related to the Supreme Personality of Godhead, though they are material, 
is called incomplete renunciation." Renunciation is complete when it is in 
the knowledge that everything in existence belongs to the Lord and that 
no one should claim proprietorship over anything. One should understand 
that, factually, nothing belongs to anyone. J'hen where is the question of 
renunciation? One who knows that everything is Kr�.pa's property is always 
situated in renunciation. Since everything belongs to Kr��a, everything 
should be employed in the service of Kr�.pa. This perfect form of action in 
Kr��a consciousness is far better than any amount of artificial renunciation 
by a sannyiisi of the Mayavadi school.

One who neither hates nor desires the fruits of his activities is known to 
be always renounced. Such a person, liberated from all dualities, easily 
overcomes material bondage and is completely liberated, 0 mighty-armed 
Arjuna. 
PURPORT 
One who is fully in Kr�pa consciousness is always a renouncer because 
he feels neither hatred nor desire for the results of his actions. Such a 
renouncer, dedicated to the transcendental loving service of the Lord, is 
fully qualified in knowledge because he knows his constitutional position 
in his relationship with Kr�pa. He knows fully well that Krwa is the whole 
and that he is part and parcel of Kr�pa. Such knowledge is perfect because 
it is qualitatively and quantitatively correct. The concept of oneness with 
Kr�Q.a is incorrect because th� part cannot be equaJ to the whole. Know­
ledge that one is one in quality yet different in quantity is correct transcen­
dental knowledge leading one to become full in himself, having nothing to 
aspire to nor lament over. There is no duality in his mind because whatever 
he does, he does for Kr�pa� Being thus freed from the platform of dualities, 
he is liberated-even in this material world.

TRANSLATION 
Only the ignorant speak of karma-yoga and devotional service as being 
different from the analytical study of the material world [ sarikhya]. Those 
who are actually learned say that he who applies himself well to one of 
these paths achieves the results of both. 
PURPORT 
The aim of the analytical study of the material world is to find the soul 
of existence. The soul of the material world is Vi��u, or the Supersoul. 
Devotional service to the Lord entails service to the Supersoul. One 
process is to find the root of the tree, and next to water the root. The real 
student of siinkhya philosophy finds the root of the material world, Vi��u, 
and then, in perfect knowledge, engages himself in the service of the Lord. 
Therefore, in essence, there is no difference between the two because the 
aim of both is Vi��u. Those who do not know the ultimate end say that 
the purposes of siinkhya and karma-yoga are not the same, but one who is 
learned knows the unifying aim in these different processes.

TRANSLATION 
One who knows that the position reached by means of renunciation can 
also be attained by works in devotional service and who therefore sees that 
the path of works and the path of renunciation are one, sees things as they 
are. 
PURPORT 
The real purpose of philosophical research is to find the ultimate goal of 
life. Since the ultimate goal of life is self-realization, there is no difference 
between the conclusions reached by the two processes. By siinkhya philo­
sophical research one comes to the conclusion that a living entity is not a 
part and parcel of the material world, but of the supreme spirit whole. 
Consequently, the spirit soul has nothing to do with the material world; 
his actions must be in some relation with the Supreme. When he acts in 
Kmta consciousness, he is actually in his constitutional position. In the 
first process of siinkhya, one has to become detached from matter, and in 
the devotional yoga process one has to attach himself to the work of Kr�pa . 
Factually, both processes are the same, although superficially one process 
appears to involve detachment and the other process appears to involve 
attachment. However, det;tchment from matter and attachment to Kf�pa 
are one and the same. One who can see this sees things as they are.

PURPORT 
There are two classes of sannyasis, or persons in the renounced order of 
life. The l\Iayavadl sannyasis are engaged in the study of sankhya phi­
losophy, whereas the Vai�J).ava sannyasis are engaged in the study of 
Bhiigavatam philosophy, which affords the proper commentary on the 
Vedanta-siitras. The Mayavadi sannyasis also study the Vedanta-siitras, 
but use their own commenatry, called Sariraka-bh(4ya, 
written by 
Sarikaracarya. The students of the Bhiigavata school are engaged in devo­
tional service of the Lord, according to paiicaratriki regulations, and there­
fore the V ai�pava sannyasis have multiple engagements in the transcen­
dental service of the Lord. The V ai�pava sannyasis have nothing to do with 
material activities, and yet they perform various activities in their devo­
tional service to the Lord. But the Mayavadi sannyasis, engaged in the 
studies of sankhya and Vedanta and speculation, cannot relish transcen­
dental service of the Lord. Because their studies become very tedious, they 
sometimes become tired of Brahman speculation, and thus they take 
shelter of the Bhiigavatam without proper understanding. Consequently 
their study of the Srimad-Bhagavatam becomes troublesome. Dry specula­
tions and impersonal interpretations by artificial means are all useless for 
the Mayavadi sannyasis. The V ai�pava sannyasis, who are engaged in devo­
tional service, are happy in the discharge of their transcendental duties, and 
they have the guarantee of ultimate entrance into the kingdom of God. 
The Mayavadi sannyasis sometimes fall down from the path of self­
realization and again enter into material activities of a philanthropic and

altruistic nature, which are nothing but material engagements. Therefore, 
the conclusion is that those who are engaged in Kr��a consciousness are 
better situated than the sannyiisis engaged in simple Brahman speculation, 
although they too come to Kr��a consciousness, after many births.

One who works in devotion, who is a pure soul, and who controls his

always working, such a man is never entangled. 
PURPORT 
One who is on the path of liberation by Kr��a consciousness is very 
dear to every living being, and every living being is dear to him. This is due 
to his Kr�pa consciousness. Such a person cannot think of any living being 
as separate from. Kr�pa, just as the leaves and branches of a tree are not 
separate from the tree. He knows very well that by pouring water on the 
root of the tree, the water will be distributed to all the leaves and branches, 
or by supplying food to the stomach, the energy is automatically distrib­
uted throughout the body. Because one who works in Kr�'.la conscious­
ness is servant to all, he is very dear to everyone. And, because everyone is 
280 
Bhagavad-gita As Ii Is 
[Ch. 5 
satisfied by his work, he is pure in consciousness. Because he is pure in con­
sciousness, his mind is completely controlled. And, because his mind is 
controlled, his senses are also controlled. Because his mind is always fixed 
on K.r�JJ.a, there is no chance of his being deviated from K.r�JJ.a. Nor is there 
a chance that he will engage his senses in matters other than the service of 
the Lord. He does not like to hear anything except topics relating to Kr�pa; 
he does not like to eat anything which is not offered to Kr�pa; and he does 
not wish to go anywhere if K,r�pa is not involved. Therefore, his senses are 
controlled. A man of controlled senses cannot be offensive to anyone. 
One may ask, "Why then was Aijuna offensive (in battle) to others? Wasn't 
he in Kr�Qa consciousness?" Aijuna was only superficially offensive 
because (as has already been explained in the Second Chapter) all the 
assembled persons on the battlefield would continue to live individually, 
as the soul cannot be slain. So, spiritually, no one was killed on the Battle­
field of Kuruk�etra. Only their dresses were changed by the order of K.r�JJ.a, 
who was personally present. Therefore Aijuna, while fighting on the Battle­
field of Kuruk�etra, was not really fighting at all; he was simply carrying 
out the orders of K,r�pa in full K.r�JJ.a consciousness. Such a person is never 
entangled in the reactions of work.

TRANSLATION 
A person in the divine consciousness, although engaged in seeing, hear­
ing, touching, smelling, eating, moving about, sleeping, and breathing, 
always knows within himself that he actually does nothing at all. Because 
while speaking, evacuating, receiving, opening or closing his eyes, he always 
knows that only the material senses are engaged with their objects and that 
he is aloof from them. 
· 
PURPORT 
A person in Kr�pa consciousness is pure in his existence, and consequent­
ly he has nothing to do with any work which depends upon five immediate 
and remote causes: the doer'· the work, the situation, the endeavor and 
fortune. This is because he is engaged in the loving transcendental service 
of Kr�pa. Although he appears to be acting with his body and senses, he is 
always conscious of his actual position, which is spiritual engagement. 
In material consciousness, the senses are engaged in sense gratifica­
tion, but in Kr�Q.a consciousness the senses are engaged in the satisfaction 
of Kr�Q.a's senses. Therefore, the Kr�Q.a conscious person is always free, 
even though he appears to be engaged in things of the senses. Activities 
such as seeing, hearing, speaking, evacuating, etc., are actions of the senses 
meant for work. A Kr�Q.a consciousness person is never affected by the 
actions of the senses. He cannot perform any act except in the service of 
the Lord because he knows that he is the eternal servitor of the Lord.

TRANSLATION 
One who performs his duty without attachment, surrendering the 
results unto the Supreme God, is not affected by sinful action, as the lotus 
leaf is untouched by water. 
PURPORT 
Here brahma!li means in Kr�l).a consciousness. The material world is a 
sum total manifestation of the three modes of material nature, technically 
called the pradhana. The Vedic hymns, sarvam etad brahma, tasmad etad 
brahma niima-riipam annam ca jayate, and, in the Bhagavad-gita, mama 
yonir mahad brahma, indicate that everything in the material world is the 
manifestation of Brahman; and, although the effects are differently mani­
fested, they are nondifferent from the cause. In the lsopan�ad it is said that 
everything is related to the Supreme Brahman or Kr�pa, and thus every­
thing belongs to Him only. One who knows perfectly well that everything 
belongs to K�pa, that He is th� proprietor of everything and that, there­
fore, everything is engaged in the service of the Lord, naturally has nothing 
to do with the results of his activities, whether virtuous . or sinful. Even 
one's material body, being a gift of the Lord for carrying out a particular 
type of action, can be engaged in Kr�pa consciousness. It is beyond con­
tamination by sinful reactions, exactly as the lotus leaf, though remaining 
in the water, is not wet. The Lord also says in the Gitii: mayi sarvii!li kar­
miirti sannyasya: "Resign all works unto Me [Kr�pa]. ''The conclusion is that 
a person without Kr�pa consciousness acts according to the concept of the 
material body and senses, but a person in Kr�pa consciousness acts accord­
ing to the knowledge that the body is the property of Kr�l).a and should 
therefore be engaged in the service of Krwa.

TRANSLATION 
The yogis, abandoning attachment, act with body, mind, intelligence, 
and even with the senses, only for the purpose of purification. 
PURPORT 
By acting in Krwa consciousness for the satisfaction of the senses of 
Kr��a, any action, whether of the body, mind, intelligence or even of the 
senses, is purified of material contamination. There are no material reac­
tions resulting from the activities of a Kr��a conscious person. Therefore, 
purified activities, which are generally called sadiicara, can be easily per­
formed by acting in Kr��a consciousness. Sri Riipa Gosvam'i in his Bhakti­
rasiimrta-sindhu describes this as follows: 
ihii yasya harer diisye karmap.ii manasii gira 
nikhiliisv apy avasthasu jivanmukta� sa ucyate 
A person acting in Kr�pa consciousness (or, in other words, in the service 
of Kr��a) with his body, mind, intelligence and words is a liberated person 
even within the material world, although he may be engaged in many so­
called material activities. He has no false ego, nor does he believe that he 
is this material body, nor that he possesses the body. He knows that he is

not this body and that this body does not belong to him. He himself 
belongs to Kr��a, and the body too belongs to Kr��a. When he applies 
everything produced of ihe body, mind, intelligence, words, life, wealth, 
etc.-whatever he may have within his possession-to Kr��a's service, he is 
at once dovetailed with Kr��a. He is one with Kr��a and is devoid of the 
false ego that leads one to believe that he is the body, .etc. This is the per­
fect stage of Kr��a consciousness.

the result of all activities to Me; whereas a person who is not in union with 
the Divine, who is greedy for the fruits of his labor, becomes entangled. 
PURPORT 
rhe difference between a person in Kr�JJ.a consciousness and a person in 
bodily consciousness is that the former is attached to Kr�JJ.a, whereas the 
latter is attached to the results of his activities. The person who is attached 
to Kr�JJ.a and works for Him only is certainly a liberated person, and he is 
not anxious for fruitive rewards. In the Bhiigavatam, the cause of anxiety 
over the result of an activity is explained as being due to one's functioning

in the conception of duality, that is, without knowledge of the Absolute 
Truth. Kr�Q.a is the Supreme Absolute Truth, the Personality of Godhead. 
In Kr�Q.a consciousness, there is no duality. All that exists is a product of 
Kr�Q.a's energy, and Kr�Q.a is all good. Therefore, activities in Kr�Q.a 
consciousness are on the absolute plane; they are transcendental and have 
no material effect. One is, therefore, filled with peace in Kr�Q.a conscious­
ness. One who is, however, entangled in profit calculation for sense gratifi­
cation cannot have that peace. This is the secret of Kr�Q.a consciousness­
realization that there is no existence besides Kr�Q.a is the platform of 
peace and fearlessness.

TRANSLATION 
When the embodied living being controls his nature and mentally 
renounces all actions, he resides happily in the city of nine gates [the 
material body], neither working nor causing work to be done. 
PURPORT 
The embodied soul lives in the city of nine gates. The activities of the 
body, or the figurative city of body, are conducted automatically by the 
particular modes of nature. The soul, although subjecting himself to the 
l' 
If 
II I

[Ch. 5 
conditions of the body, can be beyond those conditions, if he so desires. 
Owing only to forgetfulness of his superior nature, he identifies with the 
material body, and therefore suffers. By Kr�Q.a consciousness, he can 
revive his real position and thus come out of his embodiment. Therefore, 
when one takes to Kr�Q.a consciousness, one at once becomes completely 
aloof from bodily activities. In such a controlled life, in which his 
deliberations are changed, he lives happily within the city of nine gates. 
The nine gates are described as follows: 
nava-dviire pure dehi hamso leliiyate bahi� 
vasi sarvasya lokasya sthiivarasya carasya ca. 
"The Supreme Personality of Godhead, who is living within the body of a 
living entity, is the controller of all living entities all over the universe. The 
body consists of nine gates: two eyes, two nostrils, two ears, one mouth, 
the anus and the genital. The living entity in his conditioned stage 
identifies himself with the body, but when he identifies himself with the 
Lord within himself, he becomes just as free as the Lord, even while in the 
body." (Svet. 3.18) 
Therefore, a Kr�Q.a conscious person is free from both the outer and 
inner activities of the material body.

TRANSLATION 
The embodied spirit, master of the city of his body, does not create 
activities, nor does he induce people to act, nor does he create the fruits 
of action. All this is enacted by the modes of material nature. 
PURPORT 
The living entity, as will be explained in the Seventh Chapter, is one in 
nature with the Supreme Lord, distinguished from matter, which is an­
other nature-called inferior-of the Lord. Somehow, the superior nature, 
the living entity, has been in contact with material nature since time 
immemorial. The temporary body or material dwelling place which he 
obtains is the cause of varieties of activities and their resultant reactions. 
Living in such a conditional atmosphere, one suffers the results of the 
activities of the body by identifying himself (in ignorance) with the body. 
It is ignorance acquired from time immemorial that is the cause of bodily 
suffering and distress. As soon as the living entity becomes aloof from the 
activities of the body, he becomes free from the reactions as well. As long 
as he is in the city of body, he appears to be the master of it, but 
actually he is neither its proprietor nor controller of its actions and reac­
tions. He is simply in the midst of the material ocean, struggling for exis­
tence. The waves of the ocean are tossing him, and he has no control over 
them. His best solution is to get out of the water by transcendental Kn>J).a 
consciousness. That alone will save him from all turmoil.

TRANSLATION 
Nor does the Supreme Spirit assume anyone's sinful or pious activities. 
Embodied beings, however, are bewildered because of the ignorance which 
covers their real knowledge. 
PURPORT 
The Sanskrit word vibhu� means the Supreme Lord who is full of 
unlimited knowledge, riches, strength, fame, beauty and renunciation. He 
is always satisfied in Himself, undisturbed by sinful or pious activities. He 
does not create a particular situation for any living entity, but the living 
entity, bewildered by ignorance, desires to be put into certain conditions 
of life, and thereby his chain of action and reaction begins. A living entity 
is, by superior nature, full of knowledge. Nevertheless, he is prone to be 
influenced by ignorance due to his limited power. The Lord is omnipotent, 
but the living entity is not. The Lord is vibhu, or omniscient, but the 
living entity- is apu, or atomic. Because he is a living soul, he has the 
capacity to desire by his free will. Such desire is fulfilled only by the 
omnipotent Lord. And so, when the living entity is bewildered in his 
desires, the Lord allows him to fulfill those desires, but the Lord is never 
responsible for the actions and reactions of the particular situation which 
may be desired. Being in a bewildered condition, therefore, the embodied 
soul identifies himself with the circumstantial material body and becomes 
subjected to the temporary misery and happiness of life. The Lord is the 
constant companion of the living entity as Paramatma, or the Supersoul, 
and therefore He can understand the desires of the individual soul, as one 
can smell the flavor of a flower by being near it. Desire is a subtle form of 
conditioning of the living entity. The Lord fulfills his desire as he deserves: 
Man proposes and God disposes. The individual is not, therefore, omnipo­
tent in fulfilling his desires. The Lord, however, can fulfill all desires, and 
the Lord, being neutral to everyone, does not interfere with the desires of 
the minute independent living entities. However, when one desires Kr�J;J.a, 
the Lord takes special care and encourages one to desire in such a way that 
one can attain to Him and be eternally happy. The Vedic hymn therefore 
declares: 
e§a u hy eva siidhu karma kiirayati tam yamebhyo lokebhya unnini§ate 
e§a u eviisiidhu karma kiirayati yamadho nini§ate.

"The Lord engages the living entity in pious activities so he may be ele­

Therefore the embodied soul, by his immemorial desire to avoid Kr�pa 
consciousness, causes his own bewilderment. Consequently, although he is 
constitutionally eternal, blissful and cognizant, due to the littleness of his 
existence he forgets his constitutional position of service to the Lord and 
is thus entrapped by nescience. And, under the spell of ignorance, the living 
entity claims that the Lord is responsible for his conditional existence. The 
Vediinta-sfitras also confirm this: 
va�amya-nairghwye na siipek§atviit tathii hi dariayati. 
"The Lord neither hates nor likes anyone, though He appears to."

Bhagavad-glta As It Is 
[Ch. 5 
PURPORT 
Those who have forgotten Kr�l).a must certainly be bewildered, but those 
who are in Kr�l).a consciousness are not b�wildered at all. It is stated in the 
Bhagavad-gitii, "sarvam jniina-plavena," ''jniiniigni[l, saroa-karmiip,i" and "na 
hi jniiriena sadrsam." Knowledge is always highly esteemed. And what is 
that knowledge? Perfect knowledge is achieved when one surrenders unto 
Kr�!J.a, as is said in the Seventh Chapter, 19th verse: bahiiniim janmaniim 
ante jniinaviin miim prapadyate. After passing through many, many births, 
when one perfect in knowledge surrenders unto Kr�!J.a, or when one attains 
Kr�!la consciousness, then everything is revealed to him, as the sun reveals 
everything in the daytime. The living entity is bewildered in so many ways. 
For instance, when he thinks himself God, unceremoniously, he actually 
falls into the last snare of nescience. If a living entity is God, then how can 
he become bewildered by nescience? Does God become bewildered by 
nescience? If so, then nescience, or Satan, is greater than God. Real know­
ledge can be obtained from a person who is in perfect Kr�!la consciousness. 
Therefore, one has to seek out such a bona fide spiritual master and, under 
him, learn what Kr�!la consciousness is. The spiritual master can drive 
away all nescience, as the sun drives away darkness. Even though a person 
may be in full knowledge that he is not this body but is transcendental to 
the body, he still may not be able to discriminate between the soul and the 
Supersoul. However, he can know everything well if he cares to take shel­
ter of the perfect, bona fide Kr�!la conscious spiritual master. One can 
know God and one's relationship with God only when one actually meets 
a representative of God. A representative of God never claims that he is 
God, although he is paid all the respect ordinarily paid to God because he 
has knowledge of God. One has to learn the distinction between God and 
the living entity. Lord Sri Kr�!la therefore stated in the Second Chapter 
(2.12) that every living being is individual and that the Lord also is indi­
vidual. They were all individuals in the past, they are individuals at present, 
and they will continue to be individuals in the future, even a:fter liberation. 
At night we see everything as one in the darkness, but in day when the sun 
is up, we see everything in its real identity. Identity with individuality in 
spiritual life is real knowledge.

TRANSLATION 
When one's intelligence, mind, faith and refuge are all fixed in the 
Supreme, then one becomes fully cleansed of misgivings through complete 
knowledge and thus proceeds straight on the path of liberation. 
PURPORT 
The Supreme Transcendental Truth is Lord Kr�:r;ta. The whole Bhagavad­
gitii centers around the declaration of Kr�pa as the Supreme Personality of 
Godhead. That is the version of all Vedic literature. Paratattva means the 
Supreme Reality, who is understood by the knowers of the Supreme as 
Brahman, Paramatma and Bhagavan. Bhagavan, or the Supreme Person­
ality of Godhead, is the last word in the Absolute. There is nothing more 
than that. The Lord says, matta� paratararh niinyat kin cit asti dhanaiijaya. 
Impersonal Brahman is also supported by K�pa: brahmarto prat�thiiham. 
Therefore in all ways Kr�pa is the Supreme Reality. One whose mind, 
intelligence, faith and refuge are always in Kr�pa, or, in other words, one 
who is fully in Kr�pa consciousness, is undoubtedly washed clean of all 
misgivings and is in perfect knowledge in everything concerning transcen­
dence. A K�pa conscious person can thoroughly understand that there is 
duality (simultaneous identity and individuality) in Kr�pa, and, equipped 
with such transcendental knowledge, one can make steady progress on the 
path of liberation.

TRANSLATION 
The humble sage, by virtue of true knowledge, sees with equal vision a 
learned and gentle brahm�a, a cow, an elephant, a dog and a dog-eater 
[ outcaste] . 
PURPORT 
A K�pa conscious person does not make any distinction between species' 
or castes. The briihmapa and the outcaste may be different from the social 
point of view, or a dog, a cow, or an elephant may be different from the 
point of view of species, but these differences of body are meaningless 
from the viewpoint of a learned transcendentalist. This is due to their 
relationship to the Supreme, for the Supreme Lord, by His plenary portion 
as Paramatma, is present in everyone's heart. Such an understanding of the 
Supreme is real knowledge. As far as the bodies are concerned in different 
castes or different species of life, the Lord is equally kind to everyone 
because He treats every living being as a friend yet maintains Himself as 
Paramatma regardless of the circumstances of the living entities. The Lord 
as Paramatma is present both in the outcaste and in the briihmapa, although 
the body of a briihmapa and that of an outcaste are not the same. The 
bodies are material productions of different modes of material nature, but 
the soul and the Supersoul within the body are of the same spiritual 
quality. The similarity in the quality of the soul and the Supersoul, how­
ever, does not make them equal in quantity, for the individual soul is 
present only in that particular body, whereas the Paramatma is present in 
each and every body. A Kr�pa conscious person has full knowledge of this, 
and therefore he is truly learned and has equal vision. The similar charac­
teristics of the soul and Supersoul are that they are both conscious, eternal 
and blissful. But the difference is that the individual soul is conscious

within the limited jurisdiction of the body, whereas the Supersoul is con­
scious of all bodies. The Supersoul is present in all bodies without dis­
tinction.

Those whose minds are established in sameness and equanimity have al­
ready conquered the conditions of birth and death. They are flawless like 
Brahman, and thus they are already situated in Brahman. 
PURPORT 
Equanimity of mind, as mentioned above, is the sign of self-realization. 
Those who have actually attained to .such a stage should be considered to 
have conquered material conditions, specifically birth and death. As long 
as one identifies with this body, he is considered a conditioned soul, but as 
soon as he is elevated to the stage of equanimity through realization of 
self, he is liberated from conditional life. In other words, he is no longer 
subject to take birth in the material world but can enter into the spiritual 
sky after his death. The Lord is flawless because He is without attraction 
or hatred. Similarly, when a living entity is without attraction or hatred, he 
also becomes flawless and eligible to enter into the spiritual sky. Such

A person who neither rejoices upon achieving something pleasant nor

The symptoms of the self-realized person are given herein. The first 
symptom is that he is not illusioned by the false identification of the body 
with his true self. He knows perfectly well that he is not this body, but is 
the fragmental portion of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. He is 
therefore not joyful in achieving something, nor does he lament in losing 
anything which is related to his body. This steadiness of mind is called 
sthira-buddh� or self�intelligence. He is therefore never bewildered b}' 
mistaking the gross body for the soul, nor does he accept the body as 
permanent and disregard the existence of the soul. This knowledge elevates 
him to the station of knowing the complete science of the Absolute Truth,

namely Brahman, Paramatma and Bhagavan. He thus knows his constitu­
tional position perfectly well, without falsely trying to become one with 
the Supreme in all respects. This is called Brahman realization, or self­
realization, Such steady consciousness is called Kn;va consciousness.

Sri 
Yamunacarya,

realizing ever-new pleasure in Him, whenever I think of sex pleasure, I spit 
296

at the thought, and my lips curl with distaste." A person in brahma-yoga, 
or Kr�:r;ta consciousness, is so absorbed in the loving service of the Lord that 
he loses his taste for material sense pleasure altogether. The highest pleasure 
in terms of matter is sex pleasure. The whole world is moving under its 
spell, and a materialist cannot work at all without this motivation. But a 
person engaged in Kr�:r;ta consciousness can work with greater vigor without 
sex pleasure, which he avoids. That is the test in spiritual realization. 
Spiritual realization and sex pleasure go ill together. A Kr�:r;ta conscious 
person is not attracted to any kind of sense pleasure due to his being a 
liberated soul.

Material sense pleasures are due to the contact of the material senses, 
which are all temporary because the body itself is temporary. A liberated 
Text 23] 
Karma-yoga-Action in Kr�l}.a Consciousness

soul is not interested in anything which is temporary. Knowing well the 
joys of transcendental pleasures, how can a liberated soul agree to enjoy 
false pleasure? In the Padma Puriir-a it is said: 
ramante yogino 'nante satyiinanda-cid-iitmani 
iti riima-padeniisau pararh brahmiibhidhiyate 
... The mystics derive unlimited transcendental pleasures from the Absolute 
Truth, and therefore the Supreme Absolute Truth, the Personality of God­
head, is also known as Ram a." 
In the Srimad-Bhiigavatam also it is said: 
niiyarh deho deha-bhiijiirh nr-loke

"My dear sons, there is no reason to labor very hard for sense pleasure 
while in this human form of life; such pleasures at:e available to the stool­
eaters [hogs]. Rather, you should undergo penances in this life by which 
your existence will be purified, and, as a result, you will be able to enjoy 
unlimited transcendental bliss." (Bhiig. 5.5.1) 
Therefore, those who are true yogis or learned transcendentalists are not 
attracted by sense pleasures, which are the causes of continuous material 
existence. The more one is addicted to material pleasures, the more he is 
entrapped by material miseries.

of the material senses and check the force of desire and anger, he is a 
yogi and is happy in this world. 
PURPORT 
If one wants to make steady progress on the path of self-realization, he 
must try to control the forces of the material senses. There are the forces 
of talk, forces of anger, forces of mind, forces of the stomach, forces of 
the genitals, and forces of the tongue. One who is able to control the 
forces of all these different senses, and the mind, is called gosviimi, or 
sviimi. Such gosvamis live strictly controlled lives, and forego altogether 
the forces of the senses. Material desires, when unsatiated, generate anger, 
and thus the mind, eyes and chest become agitated. Therefore, one must 
practice to control them before one gives up this material body. One who 
can do this is understood to be self-realized and is thus happy in the state 
of self-realization. It is the duty of the transcendentalist to try strenuously 
to control desire and anger.

TRANSLATION 
One whose happiness is within, who is active within, who reJOICes 
within and is illumined within, is actually the perfect mystic. He is 
liberated in the Supreme, and ultimately he attains the Supreme. 
PURPORT 
Unless one is able to relish happiness from within, how can one retire 
from the external engagements meant for deriving superficial happiness? 
A liberated person enj oys happiness by factual experience. He can, there­
fore, sit silently at any place and enjoy the activities of life from within. 
Such a liberated person no longer desires external material happiness. 
This state is called brahma-bhiita, attaining which one is assured of going 
back to Godhead, back to home.

[Ch. 5 
PURPORT 
Only a person who is fully in Kr��a consciousness can be said to be 
engaged in welfare work for all living entities. When a person is 
actually 
in the knowledge that Kr��a is the fountainhead of everything, then 
when he acts in that spirit he acts for everyone. The sufferings of humanity 
are due to forgetfulness of Kr��� as the supreme enjoyer, the supreme 
proprietor, and the supreme friend. Therefore, to act to revive this 
consciousness within the entire human society is the highest welfare 
work. One cannot be engaged in first-class welfare work without being 
liberated in the Supreme. A Kr��a conscious person has no doubt about 
the supremacy of Kr��a. He has no doubt because he is completely freed 
from all sins. This is the state of divine love. 
A person engaged only in ministering to the physical welfare of 
human society cannot factually help anyone. Temporary relief of the 
external body and the mind is not satisfactory. The real cause of one's 
difficulties in the hard struggle for life may be found in one's forget­
fulness of his relationship with the Supreme Lord. When a man is fully 
conscious of his relationship with Kr��a, he is actually a liberated soul, 
although he may be in the material tabernacle.

TRANSLATION 
Those who are free from anger and all material desires, who are self­
realized, self-disciplined and constantly endeavoring for perfection, are 
assured of liberation in the Supreme in the very near future. 
PURPORT 
Of the saintly persons who are constantly engaged in striving toward 
salvation, one who is in Kr�!la consciousness is the best of all. The Bhiiga­
vatam confirms this fact as follows: 
yat-piida-pankaja-paliisa-viliisa-bhaktyii 
karmiisayam grathitam udgrathayanti san taft 
tadvan na rikta-matayo yatayo 'pi ruddha­
srotogapiis tam arapmh bhaja viisudevam. 
"Just try to worship, in devotional service, Vasudeva, the Supreme Person­
ality of Godhead. Even great sages are not able to control the forces of 
the senses as effectively as those who are engaged in transcendental bliss by 
serving the lotus feet of the Lord, uprooting the deep grown desire for 
fruitive activities." (Bhiig. 4.22.39) 
In the conditioned soul the desire to enjoy the fruitive results of work 
is so deep-rooted that it is very difficult even for the great sages to control 
such desires, despite great endeavors. A devotee of the Lord, constantly 
engaged in devotional service in Kr�!la consciousness, perfect in self­
realization, very quickly attains liberation in the Supreme. Owing to his 
complete knowledge in self-realization, he always remains in trance. To 
cite an analagous example of this: 
darsana-dhyiina-samsparsair matsya-kiirma-vihangamiift 
sviinya patyiini pu�panti tathiiham api padmaja. 
"By vision, by meditation and by touch only do the fish, the tortoise and 
the birds maintain their offspring. Similarly do I also, 0 Padmaja!" 
The fish brings up its offspring simply by looking at them. The tortoise 
brings up its offspring simply by meditation. The eggs of the tortoise are 
laid on land, and the tortoise meditates on the eggs while in the water. 
Similarly, a devotee in Kr�!la consciousness, although far away from the 
Lord's abode, can elevate himself to that abode simply by thinking of Him

constantly-by engagement in Kr�9a consciousness. He does not feel the 
pangs of material miseries; this state of life is called brahma-niroiir-a, or the 
absence of material miseries due to being constantly immersed in the Su­
preme.

TRANSLATION 
Shutting out all external sense objects, keeping the eyes and vision con­
centrated between the two eyebrows, suspending the inward and outward 
breaths within the nostrils-thus controlling the mind, senses and intelli­
gence, the transcendentalist becomes free from desire, fear and anger. One 
who is always in this sta:te is certainly liberated.

Karma-yoga-Action in Kr�J].a Consciousness 
303· 
PURPORT 
Being engaged in Kr�pa consciousness, one can immediately understand 
one's spiritual identity, and then one can understand the Supreme Lord by 
means of devotional service. When he is well situated in devotional service, 
one comes to the transcendental position, qualified to feel the presence of 
the Lord in the sphere of one's activity. This particular position is called 
liberation in the Supreme. 
After explaining the above principles of liberation in the Supreme, the 
Lord gives instruction to Arjuna as to how one can come to that position 
by the practice of mysticism or yoga, known as 0-§tanga-yoga, which is 
divisible into an eightfold procedure called yama, niyama, asana, priipii­
yiima, pratyiihiira, dharap.a, dhyana, and samiidhi. In the Sixth Chapter the 
subject of yoga is explicitly detailed, and at the end of the Fifth it is only 
preliminarily explained. One has to drive out the sense objects such as 
sound, touch, form, taste and smell by the pratyiihiira (breathing) process 
in yoga, and then keep the vision of the eyes between the two .eyebrows 
and concentrate on the tip of the nose with half closed lids. There is no 
benefit in closing the eyes altogether, because then there is every chance of 
falling asleep. Nor is there benefit in opening the eyes completely, because 
then there is the hazard of being attracted by sense objects. The breathing 
movement is restrained within the nostrils by neutralizing the up- and 
down-moving air within the body. By practice of such yoga one is able to 
gain control over the senses, refrain from outward sense objects, and thus 
prepare oneself for liberation in the Supreme. 
This yoga process helps one become free from all kinds of fear and anger 
and thus feel the presence of the Supersoul in the transcendental situation. 
In other words, Kr�pa consciousness is the easiest process of executing 
yoga principles. This will be thoroughly explained in the next chapter. A 
Kr�pa consciou::s person, however, being always engaged in devotional ser­
vice, does not risk losing his senses to some other engagement. This is a 
better way of controlling the senses than by the a§tanga-yoga.

TRANSLATION 
The sages, knowing Me as the uitimate purpose of all sacrifices and 
austerities, the Supreme Lord of all planets and demigods and the bene­
factor and well-wisher of all living entities, attain peace from the pangs of 
material miseries. 
PURPORT 
The conditioned souls within the clutches of illusory energy are all 
anxious to attain peace in the material world. But they do not know the 
formula for peace, which is explained in this part of the Bhagavad-gitii. The 
greatest peace formula is simply this: Lord Kr��a is the beneficiary in all 
human activities. Men should offer everything to the transcendental ser­
vice of the Lord because He is the proprietor of all planets and the demi­
gods thereon. No one is greater than He. He is greater than the greatest of 
the demigods, Lord Siva and Lord Brahma. In the Vedas the Supreme Lord 
is described as tam iSvarii"{liirh paramam mahesvaram. Under the spell of 
illusion, living entities are trying to be lords of all they survey, but actually 
they are dominated by the material energy of the Lord. The Lord is the 
master of material nature, an.d the conditioned souls are under the stringent 
rules of material nature. Unless one understands these bare facts, it is not 
possible to achieve peace in the world either individually or collectively. 
This is the sense of Kr�l).a consciousness: Lord Kr�l).a is the supreme 
predominator, and all living entities, including the great demigods, are 
His subordinates. One can attain perfect peace only in complete Kr�l).a 
consciousness. 
This Fifth Chapter is a practical explanation of Kr�l).a consciousness, 
generally known as karma-yoga. The question of mental speculation as to 
how karma-yoga can give liberation is answered herewith. To work in 
Kr�l).a consciousness is to work with the complete knowledge of the Lord 
Text 29] 
Karma-yoga-Action in Kr�J].a Consciousness 
305 
as the predominator. Such work is not different from transcendental 
knowledge. Direct Kr�Q.a consciousness is bhakti-yoga, and jii.iina-yoga is a 
path leading to bhakti-yoga. Kr�Q.a consciousness means to work in full 
knowledge of one's relationship with the Supreme Absolute, and the 
perfection of this consciousness is full knowledge of Kr�Q.a, or the Supreme 
Personality of Godhead. A pure soul is the eternal servant of God as His 
fragmental part and parcel. He comes into contact with miiyii (illusion) 
due to the desire to lord it over miiyii, and that is the cause of his many 
sufferings. As long as he is in contact with matter, he has to execute work 
in terms of material necessities. Kr�Q.a consciousness, however, brings one 
into spiritual life even while one is within the jurisdiction of matter, for 
it is an arousing of spiritual existence by practice in the material world. 
The more one is advanced, the more he is freed from the clutches of matter. 
The Lord is not partial toward anyone. Everything depends on one's 
practical performance of duties in an effort to control the senses and 
conquer the influence of desire and anger. And, attaining Kr�Q.a conscious­
ness by controlling the above-mentioned passions, one remains factually 
in the transcendental stage, or brahman-niroiir.a. The eightfold yoga 
mysticism is automatically practiced in Kr�Q.a consciousness because the 
ultimate purpose is served. There is gradual process of elevation in the 
practice of yama, niyama, iisana, pratyiihiira, dhyiina, dhiirar.ii, priir.iiyiima, 
and samiidhi. But these only preface perfection by devotional service, 
which alone can award peace to the human being. It is the highest perfec­
tion of life. 
Thus end the Bhaktivedanta Purports to the Fifth Chapter of the 
Srimad-Bhagavad-gita in the matter of Karma-yoga, or Action in K!§T)a 
Consciousness.

TRANSLATION 
The Blessed Lord said: One who is unattached to the fruits of his work 
and who works as he is obligated is in the renounced order of life, and he 
is the true mystic: not he who lights no fire and performs no work. 
PURPORT 
In this chapter the Lord explains that the process of the eightfold yoga 
system is a means to control the mind and the senses. However, this is very 
difficult for people in general to perform, especially in the age of Kali. 
Although the eightfold yoga system is recommended in this chapter, the 
Lord emphasizes that the process of karma-yoga, or acting in Kr�J).a con­
sciousness, is better. Everyone acts in this world to maintain his family 
and their paraphernalia, but no one is working without some self-interest, 
some personal gratification, be it concentrated or extended; The criterion 
of perfection is to act in Kr�J).a consciousness, and not with a view to 
, . 
enjoying the fruits of work. To act in Kr�J).a consciousness is the duty of 
every living entity because all are constitutionally parts and parcels of the 
Supreme. The parts of the body work for the satisfaction of the whole 
body. The limbs of the body do not act for self-satisfaction but for the 
satisfaction of the complete whole. Similarly, the living entity who acts for 
satisfaction of the supreme whole and not for personal satisfaction is the 
perfect sannyiisi, the perfect yogi. 
The sannyiisis sometimes artificially think that they have become liber­
ated from all material duties, and therefore they cease to perform agnihotra 
yajiias (fire sacrifices), but actually they are self-interested because their 
goal is becoming one with the impersonal Brahman. Such a desire is 
greater than any material desire, but it is not without self-interest. 
Similarly, the mystic yogi who practices the yoga system with half-open 
eyes, ceasing all material activities, desires some satisfaction for his personal 
self. But a person acting in Kr�J).a consciousness works for the satisfaction 
of the whole, without self-interest. A Kr�J).a conscious person has no desire 
for self-satisfaction. His criterion of success is the satisfaction of Kr�J).a, 
and thus he is the perfect sannyiisi, or perfect yogi. Lord Caitanya, the 
highest perfectional symbol of renunciation, prays in this way: 
na dhanarh na janarh na sundarirh kavitiirh vii jagadiSa kiimaye. 
mama janmani janmaniSvare bhavatiid bhaktir ahaituki tvayi. 
"0 Almighty Lord, I have no desire to accumulate wealth, nor to enjoy

TRANSLATION 
What is called renunciation is the same as yoga, or linking oneself with 
the Supreme, for no one can become a yogi unless he renounces the desire 
for sense gratification. 
PURPORT 
Real sannyiisa-yoga or bhakti means that one should know his constitu­
tional position as the living entity, and act accordingly. The living entity 
has no separate independent identity. He is the marginal energy of the 
Supreme. When he is entrapped by material energy, he is conditioned, and 
when he is Kr�J)a cons�ious, or aware of the spiritual energy, then he is in 
his real and natural state of life. Therefore, when one is in complete know­
ledge, one ceases all material sense gratification, or renounces all kinds of 
sense gratificatory activities. This is practiced by the yogis who restrain the 
sen$es from material attachment. But a person in Kr�r,ta consciousness has 
no opportunity to_ engage his senses in anything which is not for the pur­
pose of Kr�J)a. Therefore, a Kr�J)a conscious person is simultaneously a 
!' 
f 
310 
Bhagavad-gita As It Is 
[Ch. 6 
sannyiisi and a yogi. The purpose of knowledge and of restraining the 
senses, as prescribed in the jniina and yoga processes, is automatically 
served in Kr�r;ta consciousness. If one is unable to give up the activities of 
his selfish nature, then jniina and yoga are of no avail. The real aim is for a 
living entity to give up all selfish satisfaction and to be prepared to satisfy 
the Supreme. A Kr�r;ta conscious person has no desire for any kind of self­
enjoyment. He is always engaged for the enjoyment of the Supreme. One 
who has no information of the Supreme must therefore be engaged in self­
satisfaction because no one can stand on the platform of inactivity. All 
these purposes are perfectly served by the practice of Kr�r;ta consciousness.

TRANSLATION 
For one who is a neophyte in the eightfold yoga system, work is said to 
he the means; and for one who has already attained to yoga, cessation of 
all material activities is said to be the means. 
PURPORT 
The process of linking oneself with the Supreme is called yoga, which 
may be compared to a ladder for attaining the topmost spiritual realization. 
This ladder begins from the lowest material condition of the living entity 
and rises up to perfect self-realization i.n pure spiritual life. According to 
Text 4] 
Sarikhya-yoga 
311 
various elevations, different parts of the ladder are known by different 
names. But all in all, the complete ladder is called yoga and may be divided 
into three parts, namely jiiiina-yoga, dhyiina-yoga and bhakti-yoga. The 
beginning of the ladder is called the yogiiruruk�a stage, and the highest 
rung is called yogiirii,Pha. 
Concerning the eightfold yoga system, attempts in the beginning to 
enter into meditation through regulative principles of life and practice 
of different sitting postures (which are more or less bodily exercises) 
are considered fruitive material activities. All such activities lead to 
achieving perfect mental equilibrium to control the senses. When one is 
accomplished in the practice of meditation, he ceases .all disturbing 
mental activities. 
A Kr�IJ.a conscious person is, however, situated from the beginning on 
the platform of meditation because he always thinks of Kn;IJ.a. And, being 
constantly engaged in the service of Kn;IJ.a, he is considered to have 
ceased all material activities.

PURPORT 
When a person is fully engaged in the transcendental loving service of the 
Lord, he is pleased in himself, and thus he is no longer engaged in sense 
gratification or in fruitive activities. Otherwise, one must be engaged in 
sense gratification, since one cannot live without engagement. Without 
Kr�IJ.a consciousness, one must be always seeking self-centered or extended 
selfish activities. But a Kr�IJ.a conscious person can do everything for the 
satisfaction of Kr�IJ.a and thereby be perfectly detached from sense grati­
fication. One who has no such realization must mechanically try to escape 
material desires before being elevated to the top rung of the yoga ladder.

TRANSLATION 
A man must elevate himself by his own mind, not degrade himself. The 
mind is the friend of the conditioned soul, and his enemy as well. 
PURPORT 
The word iitmii denotes body, mind and soul-depending upon different 
circumstances. In the yoga system, the mind and the COJtditioned soul are 
especially important. Since the mind is the central poiilt of yoga practice, 
iitmii refers here to the mind. The purpose of the yoga system is to control 
Text 6] 
Sarikhya-yoga 
313 
the mind and to draw it away from attachment to sense objects. It is 
stressed herein that the mind must be so trained that it can deliver the 
conditioned soul from the mire of nescience. In material existence one is 
subjected to the influence of the mind and the senses. In fact, the pure 
soul is entangled in the material world because of the mind's ego which 
desires to lord it over material nature. Therefore, the mind should be 
trained so that it will not be attracted by the glitter of material nature, and 
in this way the conditioned soul may be saved. One should not degrade 
oneself by attraction to sense objects. The more one is attracted by sense 
objects, the more one becomes entangled in material existence. The best 
way to disentangle oneself is to always engage the mind in Kr�l).a conscious­
ness. The word hi is used for emphasizing this point, i.e., that one must 
do this. It is also said: 
mana eva manu§yiir-am karar-am bandha-mok§ayo{t 
bandhiiya vi§ayiisango muk tyai niroi§ayam mana{t. 
"For man, mind is the cause of bondage and mind is the cause of libera­
tion. Mind absorbed in sense objects is the cause of bondage, and mind 
detached from the sense objects is the cause of liberation." Therefore, the 
mind which is always engaged in Kr�l).a consciousness is the cause of su­
preme liberation.

(Ch. 6. 
TRANSLATION 
For him who has conquered the mind, the mind is the best of friends; 
but for one who has failed to do so, his very mind will be the gr�atest 
enemy. 
PURPORT 
The purpose of practicing eightfold yoga is to control the mind in order 
to make it a friend in discharging the human mission. Unless the mind is 
controlled, the practice of yoga (for show) is simply a waste of time. One 
who cannot control his mind lives always with the greatest enemy, and 
thus his life and its mission are spoiled. The constitutional position of the 
living entity is to carry out the order of the superior. As long as one's 
mind remains an unconquered enemy, one has to serve the dictations of 
lust, anger, avarice, illusion, etc. But when the mind is conquered, one 
voluntarily agrees to abide by the dictation of the Personality of Godhead, 
who is situated within the heart of everyone as Paramatma. Real yoga 
practice entails meeting the Paramatma within the heart and then following 
His dictation. For one who takes to Kr�l).a consciousness directly, perfect 
surrender to the dictation of the Lord follows automatically.

TRANSLATION 
For one who has conquered the mind, the Supersoul is already reached, 
for he has attained tranquility. To such a man happiness and distress, heat 
and cold, honor and dishonor are all the same. 
· 
PURPORT 
Actually, every living entity is intended to abide by the dictation of the 
Supreme Personality of Godhead, who is seated in everyone's heart as 
Paramatma. When the mind is misled by the external illusory energy, one 
becomes entangled in material activities. Therefore, as soon as one's mind 
is controlled through one of the yoga systems, one is to be considered as 
having already reached the destination. One has to abide by superior dicta­
tion. When one's mind is fixed on the superior nature, he hi<; no other 
alternative but to follow the dictation of the Supreme. The mind must 
admit some superior dictation and follow it. The effect of controlling the 
mind is that one automatically follows the dictation of the Paramatma or 
Supersoul. Because this transcendental position is at once achieved by one 
who is in Kr��a consciousness, the devotee of the Lord is unaffected by 
the dualities of material existence, namely distress and happiness, cold 
and heat, etc. This state is practical samiidhi, or absorption in the Supreme.

TRANSLATION 
A person is said to be established in self-realization and is called a yogi 
[or mystic] when he is fully satisfied by virtue of acquired knowledge and 
realization. Such a person is situated in transcendence and is self-controlled. 
He sees everything-whether it be pebbles, stones or gold-as the same. 
PURPORT 
Book knowledge without realization of the Supreme Truth is useless. 
This is stated as follows: 
dtaft sri-knra-niimiidi na bhaved griihyam indriyai[t 
sevonmukhe hi jihviidau svayam eva sphuraty ada[!. 
"No one can understand the. transcendental nature of the name, form, 
quality and pastimes of Sri Kmta through his materially contaminated 
senses. Only when one becomes spiritually saturated by transcendental 
service to the Lord are the tran.scendental name, form, quality and pastimes 
of the Lord revealed to him." (Padma Puriira) 
This Bhagavad-gitii is the science of Kr�!ia consciousness. No one can 
become Kr�!la conscious simply by mundane scholarship. One must be 
fortunate enough to associate with a person who is in pure consciousness. 
A Knn;ta conscious person has realized knowledge, by the grace of Kr�!la, 
because he is satisfied with pure devotional service. By realized knowledge, 
one becomes perfect. By transcendental knowledge one can remain steady 
in his convictions, but by mere academic knowledge one can be easily 
deluded and confused by apparent contradictions. It is the realized soul 
who is actually self-controlled because he is surrendered to Kr�!ia. He is 
transcendental because he has nothing to, do with mundane scholarship. 
For him mundane scholarship and mental speculation, which may be as 
good as gold to others, are of no greater value than pebbles or stones.

Bhagavad-gita As It Is 
(Ch. 6 
· 
PURPORT 
Kr�:va is realized in different degrees as Brahman, Paramatma and the 
Supreme Personality of Godhead. Kr�:va consciousness means, concisely, 
to be always engaged in the transcendental loving service of the Lord. But 
those who are attached to the impersonal Brahman or the localized Super­
soul are also partially Kr�:va conscious, because impersonal Brahman is the 
spiritual ray of Kr�:va and Supersoul is the all-pervading partial expansion 
of Kr�:va. Thus the impersonalist and the -meditator are also indirectly 
Kr�:va conscious. A directly Kr�:va conscious person is the topmost tran­
scendentalist because such a devotee knows what is meant by Brahman or 
Paramatma. His knowledge of the Absolute Truth is perfect, whereas the 
impersonalist and the meditative yogi are imperfectly Kr�:va conscious. 
Nevertheless, all of these are instructed herewith to be constantly 
engaged in their particular pursuits so that they may come to the highest 
perfection sooner or later. The first business of a transcendentalist is to 
keep the mind always on Kr�:va. One should always think of Kr�:va and not 
forget Him even for a moment. Concentration of the mind on the Supreme 
is called samiidhi, or trance. In order to concentrate the mind, one should 
always remain in seclusion and avoid disturbance by external objects. He 
should be very careful to accept favorable and reject unfavorable conditions 
that affect his realization. And, in perfect determination, he should not 
hanker after unnecessary material things that entangle him by feelings of 
possessiveness. 
All these perfections and precautions are perfectly executed when one is 
directly in Kr�va consciousness because direct Kr�:va consciousness means 
self-abnegation, wherein there is very little chance for material possessive­
ness. Srila Riipa Gosvam'i characterizes Krwa consciousness in this way: 
aniisak tasya vi§ayiin yathiirham upayuiijata[l 
nirbandha[l kr§rta-sambandhe yuktam vairiigyam ucyate 
priipaiicikatayii buddhyii hari-sambandhi-vastuna[l 
mumuk§ubhi[l parityiigo vairiigyam phalgu kath yate. 
(Bhakti-rasamrta-sindhu 2.255-256) 
"When one is not attached to anything, but at the same time accepts every­
thing in relation to Kr�:va, one is rightly situated above possessiveness. On 
the other hand, one who rejects everything without knowledge of its 
relationship to Kr�:va is not as complete in his renunciation." 
A Kr�Q.a conscious person well knows that everything belongs to Kr�Q.a, 
Texts ll-12] 
Siuikhya-yoga 
319 
and thus he is always free from feelings of personal possession. As such, he 
has no hankering for anything on his own personal account. He knows how 
to accept things in favor of Kr�IJ.a consciousness and how to reject things 
unfavorable to Kr�IJ.a consciousness. He is always aloof from material things 
because he is always transcendental, and he is always alone, having nothing 
to do with persons not in Kr�IJ.a consciousness. Therefore a person in 
Kr�IJ.a consciousness is the perfect yogi.

TRANSLATION 
To practice yoga, one should go to a secluded place and should lay 
kusa-grass on the ground and then cover it with a deerskin and a soft 
cloth. The seat should neither he too high nor too low and should he 
situated in a sacred place. The yogi should then sit on it very firmly and 
320 
Bhagavad-gita As It Is 
[Ch. 6 
should practice yoga by controlling the mind and the senses, purifying the 
heart and fixing the mind on one point. 
PURPORT 
"Sacred place" refers to places of pilgrimage. In India the yoi!f.s, the 
transcendentalists or the devotees all leave home and reside in sacred 
places such as Prayag, .Mathur a, V rndavana, Hr�lkesa, and Hard war and in 
solitude practice yoga where the sacred rivers like the Yam una and the 
Ganges flow. But often this is not possible, especially for Westerners. The 
so-called yoga societies in big cities may be successful in earning material 
benefit, but they are not at all suitable for the actual practice of yoga. One 
· 
who is not self-controlled and whose mind is not' undisturbed cannot 
practice meditation. Therefore, in the Brhan-Niiradiya Puriirw it is said 
that in the Kali-yuga (the present yuga or age) when people in general are 
short-lived, slow in spiritual realization and always disturbed by various 
anxieties, the best means of spiritual realization is chanting the holy name 
of the Lord. 
harer niima harer niima harer niimaiva kevalam 
kalau niisty eva niisty eva niisty eva gatir anyathii. 
"In this age of quarrel and hypocrisy the only means of deliverance is 
chanting the holy name of the Lord. There is no other way. There is no 
other way. There is no other way."

TRANSLATION 
One should hold one's body, neck and head erect in a straight line and 
stare steadily at the tip of the nose. Thus, with an unagitated, subdued 
mind, devoid of fear, completely free from sex life, one should meditate 
upon Me within the heart and make Me the ultimate goal of life. 
PURPORT 
The goal of life is to know Kr�l)a, who is situated within the heart of 
every living being as Paramatma, the four-handed Vi�I)U form. The yoga 
process is practiced in order to discover and see this localized form of 
Vi�l)u, and not for any other purpose. The localized Vi�l)u-murti is the 
plenary representation of Kr�IJa dwelling within one's heart. One who has 
no program to realize this Vi�l)u-miirti is uselessly engaged in mock-yoga 
practice and is certainly wasting his time. Kr�IJa is the ultimate goal of 
life, and the Vi�l)u-miirti situated in one's heart is the object of yoga prac­
tice. To realize this Vi�vu-miirti within the heart, one has to observe com­
plete abstinence from sex life; therefore one has to leave home and live 
alone in a secluded place, remaining seated as mentioned above. One can­
not enjoy sex life daily at home or elsewhere and attend a so-called yoga 
class and thus become a yogi. One has to practice controlling the mind and 
avoiding all kinds of sense gratification, of which sex life is the chief. In the 
rules of celibacy written by the great sage Yajiiavalkya it is said: 
karma(lii manasii viicii sarviivasthiisu sarvadii 
sarvatra maithu'!a-tyiigo b rahmacaryarh pracak§ate. 
322 
Bhagavad-gita As It Is 
[Ch. 6 
"The vow of brahmacarya is meant to help one completely abstain from 
sex indulgence in work, words and mind-at all times, under all circum­
stances, and in all places." No one can perform correct yoga practice 
through sex indulgence. Brahmacarya is taught, therefore, from childhood 
when one has no knowledge of sex life. Children at the age of five are sent to 
the guru-kula, or the place of the spiritual master; and the master trains the 
young boys in the strict discipline of becoming brahmaciiris. Without such 
practice, no one can make advancement in any yoga, whether it be dhyiina, 
jiiiina or bhakti. One who, however, follows the rules and regulations of 
married life, having sexual relationship only with his wife (and that also 
under regulation), is also called brahmaciiri. Such a restrained householder 
brahmaciiri may be accepted in the bhakti school, but the jiiiina and dhyiina 
schools do not admit even householder brahmaciiris. They require com­
plete abstinence without compromise. In the bhakti school, a householder 
brahmaciiri is allowed controlled sex life because the cult of bhakti-yoga 
is so powerful that one automatically loses sexual attraction, being engaged 
in the superior service of the Lord. In the Bhagavad-gitii it is said: 
vi§ayii vinivartante niriihiirasya dehina"{t 
rasa-varjarh raso 'py asya pararh dr§!vii nivartate 
Whereas others are forced to restrain themselves from sense gratification, 
a devotee of the Lord automatically refrains because of superior taste. 
Other than tlle devotee, no one has any information of that superior taste. 
Vigatabhi"{t. One cannot be fearless unless one is fully in Knn;a conscious­
ness. A conditioned soul is fearful due to his perverted memory, his forget­
fulness of his eternal relationship with Kr�J;la. The Bhiigavatam says, 
bhayarh dvitiyabhinivesata"ft syiid iSiid apetasya viparyayo 'smrti"{t: Kr�J;la 
consciousness is the only basis for fearlessness. Therefore, perfect practice 
is possible for a person who is Kr�J;la conscious. And since the ultimate 
goal of yoga practice is to see the Lord within, a Krg1a conscious person is 
already the best of all yogis. The principles of the yoga system mentioned 
herein are different from those of the popular so-called yoga societies.

TRANSLATION 
Thus practicing control of the body, mind and activities, the mystic 
transcendentalist attains to the kingdom of God [or the abode of Kn11;1a] 
by cessation of material existence. 
PURPORT 
The ultimate goal in practicing yoga is now clearly explained. Yoga 
practice is not meant for attaining any kind of material facility; it is t,o 
enable the cessation of all material existence. One who seeks an improve­
ment in health or aspires after material perfection is no yogi according to 
Bhagavad-gitii. Nor does cessation of material existence entail one's enter­
ing into "the void," which is only a myth. There is no void anywhere with­
in the creation of the Lord. Rather, the cessation of material existence 
enables one to enter into the spiritual sky, the abode of the Lord. The 
abode of the Lord is also clear!y described in the Bhagavad-gitii as that 
place where there is no need of sun, moon, nor electricity. All the planets 
in the spiritual kingdom are self-illuminated like the sun in the material 
sky. The kingdom of God is everywhere, but the spiritual sky and the 
planets thereof are called param dhiima, or superior abofles. 
A C()nsummate yog� who is perfect in understanding Lord Kr�.va, as is 
clearly stated herein (mat-citta{t, mat-para{t, mat-sthiinam) by the Lord 
Himself, can attain real peace and can ultimately reach His supreme abode, 
the Kr�.va-loka known as Goloka V rndavana. In the Brahma-samhiUi it is 
clearly stated (goloka eva nivasaty akhiliitma-bhiita{t) that the Lord, al­
though residing always in His abode called Goloka, is the all-pervading 
Brahman and the localized Paramatma as well by dint of His superior spiri­
tual energies. No one can reach the spiritual sky or enter into the eternal 
324 
Bhagavad-gita As It Is 
(Ch. 6 
abode (V aikul).tha Goloka V rndavana) of the Lord without the proper 
understanding of Kr�l).a and His plenary expansion Vi�l).u. Therefore a per­
son working in Kr�r).a consciousness is the perfect yogi, because his mind is 
always absorbed in Kf!il).a's activities. Sa vai mana[l krHw-padiiravindayo[l. 
In the Vedas also we learn: tam eva viditviitimrtyum eti: "One can over­
come the path of birth and death only by understanding the Supreme 
Personality of Godhead, Kr�l).a." In other words, perfection of the yoga 
system is the attainment of freedom from material existence and not some 
magical jugglery or gymnastic feats to befool innocent people.

There is no possibility of one's becoming a yogi, 0 Arjuna, if one eats 
too much, or eats too little, sleeps too much or does not sleep enough. 
PURPORT 
Regulation of diet and sleep is recommended herein for the yogis. Too 
much eating means eating more than is required to keep the body and soul 
together. There is no need for men to eat animals because there is an 
ample supply of grains, vegetables, fruits and milk. Such simple foodstuff 
is considered to be in the mode of goodness according to the Bhagavad­
gitii. Animal food is for those in the mode of ignorance. Therefore, those 
n 
,,

who indulge in animal food, drinking, �;moking and eating food which is 
not first offered to Kr�l)a will suffer sinful reactions because of eating only 
polluted things. Bhufijate te t.v agham papa ye pacanty 
· iitma-kiirariit. 
Anyone who eats for sense pleasure, or cooks for himself, not offering his 
food to Kr�l)a, eats only sin. One who eats sin and eats more than is 
allotted to him cannot execute perfect yoga. It is best that one eat only 
the remnants of foodstuff offered to Kr�l)a. A person in Kr�l)a conscious­
ness does not eat anything which is not first offered to Kr�l)a. Therefore, 
only the Kr�l)a conscious person can attain perfection in yoga practice. 
Nor can one who artificially abstains from eating, manufacturing his own 
personal process of fasting, practice yoga� The Kr�l)a conscious person 
observes fasting as it is recommended in the scriptures. He does not fast or 
eat more than is required, and he is thus competent to perform yoga 
practice. One who eats more than required will dream very much while 
sleeping, and he must consequently sleep more than is required. One should 
not sleep more than six hours daily. One who sleeps more than six hours 
out of twenty-four is certainly influenced by the mode of ignorance. A 
person in the mode of ignorance is lazy and prone to sleep a great deal. 
Such a person cannot perform yoga.

Bhagavad-glta As It Is 
[Ch. 6. 
PURPORT 
Extravagance in the matter of eating, sleeping, defending and mating­
which are demands of the body-can block advancement in the practice of 
yoga. As far as eating is concerned, it can be regulated only when one is 
practiced to take and accept prasii.dam, sanctified food. Lord Kr�Q.a is 
offered, according to the Bhagavad-gitii. (Bg. 9.26 ), vegetables, flowers, 
fruits, grains, milk, etc. In this way, a person in Kr�Q.a consciousness 
becomes automatically trained not to accept food not meant for human 
consumption, or which is not in the category of goodness. As far as sleeping 
is concerned, a Kr�Q.a conscious person is always alert in the discharge of 
his duties in Kr�Q.a consciousness, a,nd therefore any unnecessary time 
spent sleeping is considered a great loss. A Kr�Q.a conscious person cannot 
bear to pass a minute of his life without being engaged in the service of the 
Lord. Therefore, his sleeping is kept to a minimum. His ideal in this respect 
is Srila Rupa Gosvami, who was always engaged in the service of Kr�Q.a 
and who could not sleep more than two hours a day, and sometimes not 
even that. Thakur Handasa would not even accept prasii.dam nor even 
sleep for a moment without finishing his daily routine of chanting with 
his beads three hundred thousand names. As far as work is concerned, a 
Kr�Q.a conscious person does not do anything which is not connected with 
Kr�Q.a's interest, and thus his work is always regulated and is untainted by 
sense gratification. Since there is no question of sense gratification, there 
is no material leisure for a person in Krwa consciousness. And because he 
is regulated in all his work, speech, sleep, wakefulness and all other bodily 
activities, there is no material misery for i:iim.

When the yogi, by practice of yoga, disciplines his mental activities and 
becomes situated in Transcendence-devoid of all material desires-he is 
said to have attained yoga. 
PURPORT 
The activities of the yogi are distinguished from those of an ordinary 
person by his characteristic ces'sation from all kinds of material desires-of 
which sex is the chief. A perfect yogi is so well disciplined in the activities 
of the mind that he can no longer be disturbed by any kind of material 
desire. This perfectional stage can automatically be attained by persons in 
Kr�l).a consciousness, as is stated in the Srimad-Bhiigavatam (9.4.18-20):

"King Ambari�a first of all engaged his mind on the lotus feet of Lord 
Kr�l).a; then, one after another, he engaged his words in describing the 
transcendental qualities of the Lord, his hands in mopping the temple 
of the Lord, his ears in hearing of the activities of the Lord, his eyes in 
seeing the transcendental forms of the Lord, his body in touching the 
bodies of the devotees, his sense of smell in smelling the scents of the lotus 
flower offered to the Lord, his tongue in tasting the tulasi leaf offered at 
the lotus feet of the Lord, his legs in going to places of pilgrimage and the 
temple of the Lord, his head in offering obeisances unto the Lord and his 
desires in executing the mission of the Lord. All these transcendental 
activities are quite befitting a pure devotee." 
This transcendental stage may be inexpressible subjectively by the 
followers of the impersonalist path, but it becomes very easy and practical 
for a person in Kr�l).a consciousness, as is apparent in the above description 
of the engagements of Maharaja Ambari�a. Unless the mind is fixed on the 
lotus feet of the Lord by constant remembrance, such transcendental

engagements are not practical. In the devotional service of the Lord, 
therefore, these prescribed activities are called arcana, or engaging all the 
senses in the service of the Lord. The senses and the mind require engage­
ments. 
Simple abnegation is not practical. Therefore, for people in 
general-especially those who are not in the renounced order of life­
transcendental engagement of the senses and the mind as described above 
is the perfect process for transcendental achievement, which is called yukta 
in the Bhagavad-gitii.

Bhagavad-gita As It Is 
[Ch. 6. 
TRANSLATION 
The stage of perfection is called trance, or samadhi, when one's mind is 
completely restrained from material mental activities by practice of yoga. 
This is characterized by one's ability to see the self by the pure mind and 
to relish and rejoice in the self. In that joyous state, one is situated in 
boundless transcendental happiness and enjoys himself through transcen­
dental senses. Established thus, one never departs from the truth, and upon 
gaining this he thinks there is no greater gain. Being situated in such a 
position, one is never shaken, even in the midst of greatest difficulty. This 
indeed is actual freedom from all miseries arising from material contact. 
PURPORT 
By practice of yoga one becomes gradually detached from material 
concepts. This is the primary characteristic of the yoga principle. And 
after this, one becomes ·situated in trance, or samiidhi, which means that 
the yogi realizes the Supersoul through transcendental mind and intelli­
gence, without any of the misgivings of identifying the self with the 
Superself. Yoga practice is more or less based on the principles of the 
Patafijali system. Some unauthorized commentators try to identify the 
individual soul wit'tt the Supersoul, and the monists think this to be 
liberation, but they do not understand the real purpose of the Patafijali 
system of yoga. There is an acceptance of transcendental pleasure in the 
Patafijali system, but the monists do not accept this transcendental pleasure 
out of fear of jeopardizing the theory of oneness. The duality of knowledge 
and knower is not accepted by the nondualist, but in this verse transcen­
dental pleasure-realized through transcendental senses-is accepted. And 
this is corroborated by the Patafijali Muni, the famous exponent of the 
yoga system. The great sage 
· declares in his Y oga-siitras: puru§iirtha­
siinyiiniim gur-iiniim pratiprasava{t kaivalyam svariipa-prati§thii vii citi-sak tir 
iti. 
This citi-sakti, or internal potency, is transcendental. Puru§iirtha means 
material religiosity, economic development, sense gratification and, at the 
end, the attempt to become one with the Supreme. This "oneness with the 
Supreme" is called kaivalyam by the monist. But according to Pataii.jali, 
this kaivalyam is an internal, or transcendental, potency by which the 
living entity becomes aware of his constitutional position. In the words of 
Lord Caitanya, this state of affairs is called ceto-darpar-a-marjanam, or 
clearance of the impure mirror of the mind. This "clearance" is actually 
Text 20-23] 
Sankhya-yoga 
331 
liberation, or bhava-mahiidiivagni-niroiiparwm. The theory of nirvara-also 
preliminary-corresponds with this principle. In the Bhiigavatam this is 
called svarilpera vyavasthit*. 
The Bhagavad-gita 
also confirms 
this 
situation 
in 
this 
verse. 
After niroiira, or material cessation, there is the manifestation of spiri­
tual activities, or devotional service of the Lord, known as Kr�J)a con­
sciousness. In the words of the Bhiigavatam, svarilpera vyavasthit*: this is 
the "real life of the living entity." Miiyii, or illusion, is the ·condition of 
spiritual life contaminated by material infection. Liberation from this 
material infection does not mean destruction of the original eternal posi­
tion of the living entity. Pataiijali also accepts this by his words kaivalyam 
svarilpa-prati§thii vii citi-sak tir iti. This citi-sakti, or transcendental pleasure, 
is real life. This is confirmed in the Vediinta-siitras as iinandamayo 'bhyiisiit. 
This natural transcendental pleasure is the ultimate goal of yoga and is 
easily achieved by execution of devotional service, or bhakti-yoga. Bhakti­
yoga will be vividly described in the Seventh Chapter of Bhagavad-gitii. 
In the yoga system, as described in this chapter, there are two kinds of 
samiidhi, called samprajiiiita-samiidhi and asamprajiiiita-samiidhi. When one 
becomes situated in the transcendental position by various philosophical 
researches, it is called samprajiiiita-samadhi. In the asamprajiiiita-samiidhi 
there is no longer any connection with mundane pleasure, for one is then 
transcendental to all �orts of happiness derived from the senses. When the 
yogi is once situated in that transcendental position, he is never shaken 
from it. Unless the yogi is able to reach this position, he is unsuccessful. 
Today's so-called yoga practice, which involves various sense pleasures, is 
contradictory. A yogi indulging in sex and intoxication is a mockery. 
Even those yogis who are attracted by the siddhis (perfections) in the 
process of yoga are not perfectly situated. If the yogis are attracted by the 
by-products of yoga, then they cannot attain the stage of perfection, as is 
stated in this verse. Persons, therefore, indulging in the make-show prac­
tice of gymnastic feats or siddhis should know .that the aim of yoga is lost 
in that way. 
The best practice of yoga in this age is Kg;J)a consciousness, which is not 
baffling. A Kr�J)a conscious person is so happy in his occupation that he 
does not aspire after any other happiness. There are many impediments, 
especially in this age of hypocrisy, to practicing hatha-yoga, dhyiina-yoga, 
and jiiiina-yoga, but there is no such problem in executing karma-yoga or 
bhakti-yoga. 
As long as the material body exists, one has to meet the demands of the 
body, namely eating, sleeping, defending and mating. But a person who is 
332 
Bhagavad-gita As It Is 
[Ch. 6 
in pure bhakti-yoga or in Kr�r:ta consciousness does not arouse the senses 
while meeting the demands of the body. Rather, he accepts the bare neces­
sities of life, making the best use of a bad bargain, and enjoys transcenden­
tal happiness in Kr�r;ta consciousness. He is callous toward incidental occur­
rences-such as accidents, disease, scarcity and even the death of a most 
dear relative-but he is always alert to execute his duties in Kr�r:ta con­
sciousness or bhakti-yoga. Accidents never deviate him from his duty. As 
stated in the Bhagavad-gitii, iigamiipiiyino 'nityiis tams titik§asva bhiirata. 
He endures all such incidental occurences because he knows that they 
come and go and do not affect his duties. In this way he achieves the high­
est perfection in yoga practice.

One should engage oneself in the practice of yoga with undeviating 
determination and faith. One should abandon, without exception, all mate­
rial desires born of false ego and thus control all the senses oil all sides by 
the mind. 
Text 25) 
Sankhya-yoga 
333 
PURPORT 
The yoga practitioner should be determined and should patiently pro­
secute the practice without deviation. One should be sure of success at the 
end and pursue this course with great perserverance, not becoming discour­
aged if there is any delay in the attainment of success. Success is sure for 
the rigid practitioner. Regarding bhakti-yoga, Rupa Gosvam1 says: 
utsiihiin niScayiid dhairyiit tat tat karma-pravartaniit 
sanga-tyiigiit satovrtte{l §a4bhir bhakti{l prasidhyati 
"The process of bhakti-yoga can be executed successfully with full-hearted 
enthusiasm, perseverance, and determination by following the prescribed 
duties in the association of devotees and by engaging completely irt activi­
ties of goodness." 
As for determination, one should follow the example of the sparrow 
who lost her eggs in the waves of the ocean. A sparrow laid her eggs on the 
shore of the ocean, but the big ocean carried away the eggs ort its wave.s. 
The sparrow became very upset and asked the ocean to return her eggs. 
The ocean did not even consider her appeal. So the sparrow decided to dry 
up the ocean. She began to pick out the water in her small beak, and every­
one laughed at her for her fmpossible determination. The rtews of her ac­
tivity spread, and at last Garw;la, the gigantic bird carrier of Lord Vigm, 
heard it. He became compassionate toward his small sister bird, and so he 
came to see the sparrow. Garu�a was very pleased by the determination of 
the small sparrow, and he promised to help. Thus Giuu�a at once asked the 
ocean to return her eggs lest he himself take up the work of the sparrow. 
The ocean was frightened at this, and returned the eggs. Thus the spa,rrow 
became happy by the grace of Garu�a. 
Similarly, the practice of yoga, especially bhakti�yoga in Kr�pa con­
sciousness, may appear to be a very difficult job. But if anyone follows the 
principles with great determination, the Lord will surely help, for God 
helps those who help themselves.

Gradually, step by step, with full conviction, one should become situated 
in trance by means of intelligence, and thus the mind should be fixed on 
the Self alone and should think of nothing else. 
PURPORT 
By proper conviction and intelligence one should gradually cease sense 
activities. This is called pratyiihiira. The mind, being controlled by convic­
tion, meditation, and cessation of the senses, should be situated in trance, 
or samiidhi. At that time there is no longer any danger of becoming en­
gaged in the material [onception of life. In other words, although one is 
involved with matter as long as the material body exists, one should not 
think about sense gratification. One should think of no pleasure aside from 
the pleasure of the Supreme Self. This state is easily attained by directly 
practicing Kr�r;ta consciousness.

TRANSLATION 
From whatever and wherever the mind wanders due to its flickering and 
unsteady nature, one must certainly withdraw it and bring it back under 
the control of the Self. 
PURPORT 
The nature of the mind is flickering and unsteady. But a self-realized 
yogi has to control the mind; the mind should not control him. One who 
controls the mind (and therefore the senses as well) is called gosviimi, or 
sviimi, and one who is controlled by the mind is called godiisa, or the 
servant of the senses. A gosviimi knows the standard of sense happiness. In 
transcendental sense happiness, the senses are engaged in the service of 
Hr�1kesa or the supreme owner of the senses...:. Kr�J).a. Serving Kr�J).a with 
purified senses is called Kr�J).a consciousness. That is the way of bringing 
the senses under full control. What is more, that is the highest perfection 
ofyoga practice .

Self-realization means knowing one's constitutional position in relation­
ship to the Supreme. The individual soul is part and parcel of the Supreme, 
and his position is to render transcendental service to the Lord. This

sarva-bhiitiiniirh h.rd-dde 'rjuna ti�thati. The Lord in His Paramatma feature 
is situated within both the heart of the dog and that of a briihmarw. The 
perfect yogi knows that the Lord is eternally transcendental and is not 
materially affected by His presence in either a dog or a briihmarw. That is 
the supreme neutrality of the Lord. The individual soul is also situated in 
the individual heart, but he is not present in all hearts. That is the 
distinction between the individual soul and the Supersoul. One who is not 
factually in the practice of yoga cannot see so clearly. A Kr�?Q.a conscious 
person can see Knn;ta in the heart of both the believer and nonbeliever. In 
the smrti this is confirmed as follows: iitatatviic ca miitrtviid iitmii hi 
paramo harif!,. 
The Lord, being the source of all beings, is like the mother and the 
maintainer. As the mother is neutral to all different kinds of children, the 
Supreme Father (or Mother) is also. Consequently the Supersoul is always 
in every living being. Outwardly, also, every living, being is situated in the

energy of the Lord. As will be explained in the Seventh Chapter, the Lord 
has, primarily, two energies-the spiritual (or superior) and the material 
(or inferior). The living entity, although part of the superior energy, is 
conditioned by the inferior energy; the living entity is always in the Lord's 
energy. Every living entity is situated in Him in one way or another. The 
yogi sees equally because he sees that all living entities, although in dif­
ferent situations according to the results of fruitive work, in all circum­
stances remain the servants of God. While in the material energy, the living 
entity serves the material senses; and while in spiritual energy, he serves the 
Supreme Lord directly. In either case the living entity is the servant of 
God. This vision of equality is perfect in a person in Kr�l).a consciousness.

realization at which the devotee becomes one with Kr�Q.a in the sense that 
K{�Q.a becomes everything for the devotee, and the devotee Lecomes full in 
loving· Kr�Q.a. An intimate relationship between the Lord and the devotee 
then exists. In that stage, the living entity attains his immortality. Nor is 
the Personality of Godhead ever out of the sight of the devotee. To merge 
in Kr�Q.a is spiritual annihilation. A devotee takes no such risk. It is stated 
in the Brahma-samhitii: 
premiin jana-c ch urita-bhak ti-viloc anena 
santa� sadaiva hrdaye§U vilokayanti. 
yam syiimasundaram acintya-gupa-svarilpam 
govindam iidi-puru§am tam aham bhajiimi 
"I worship the primeval Lord, Govinda, who is always seen by the devotee 
whose eyes are anointed with the pulp of love. He is seen in His eternal 
form of Syamasundara situated within the heart of the devotee." (Bs. 5.38) 
At this stage, Lord Kr�Q.a never disappears from the sight of the devotee, 
nor does the devotee ever lose sight of the Lord. In the-case of a yogi who 
sees the Lord as Paramatma within the heart, the same applies. Such a 
yogi turns into a pure devotee and cannot bear to live for a moment with-
out seeing the Lord within himself.

Bhagavad-gita As It Is 
[Ch. 6. 
TRANSLATION 
The yogi who knows that I and the Supersoul within all creatures are 
one worships Me and remains always in Me in all circumstances. 
PURPORT 
A yogi who is practicing meditation on the Supersoul sees within him­
self the plenary portion of Kr�l).a as Vi�l).u-with four hands, holding 
conchshell, wheel, club and lotus flower. The yogi should know that 
Vi�l).U is not different from Kr�l).a. Kr�l).a in this form of Supersoul is 
situated in everyone's heart. Furthermore, there is no difference between 
the innumerable Supersouls present in the innumerable hearts of living 
entities. Nor is there a difference between a Kr�l).a conscious person always 
engaged in the transcendental loving service of Kr�l).a and a perfect yogi 
engaged in meditation on the Supersoul. The yogi in Kr�l).a consciousness­
even though he may be engaged in various activities while in material exis­
tence-remains always situated in Kr�l).a. This is confirmed in the Bhakti­
rasiimrta-sindhu of Srila Rupa Gosvami: nikhile§u avasthiisu jivanmukta 
sa ucyate. A devotee of the Lord, always acting in Kr�l).a consciousness, is 
automatically liberated. In the Niirada-paiicariitra this is confirmed in this 
way: 
dik-kiiliidy-anavacchinne kr§r-e ceto vidhiiya ca 
tanmayo bhavati k§iprarh jivo b rahmar-i yojayet. 
"By concentrating one's attention on the transcendental form of Kr�l).a, 
who is all-pervading and beyond time and space, one becomes absorbed in 
thinking of Kr�l).a and then attains the happy state of transcendental asso­
ciation with Him." 
Kr�l).a consciousness is the highest stage of trance in yoga practice. This 
very understanding that Kr�l).a is present as Paramatma in everyone's heart 
makes the yogi faultless. The Vedas confirm this inconceivable potency 
of the Lord as follows: 
eko'pi san bahudhii yo'vabhiiti 
ai.Svaryiid riipam ekarh ca silryavad bahudheyate. 
"Viwu is one, and yet He is certainly all-pervading. By His inconceivable 
potency, in spite of His one form, He is present everywhere. As the sun, He 
appears in many places at once."

TRANSLATION 
He is a perfect yogi who, by comparison to his own self, sees the 
true equality of all beings, both in their happiness and distress, 0 Arjuna! 
PURPORT 
One who is Kn;J).a conscious is a perfect yogi; he is aware of everyone's 
happiness and distress by dint of his own personal experience. The cause of 
the distress of a living entity is forgetfulness of his relationship with God. 
And the cause of happiness is knowing Kp�J).a to be the supreme enjoyer of 
all the activities of the human being. Kr�J).a is the proprietor of all lands 
and planets. The perfect yogi is the sincerest friend of all living entities. He 
knows that the living being who is conditioned by the modes of material 
nature is subjected to the threefold material miseries due to forgetfulness 
of his relationship with Kr�l)a. Because one in Kr�l)a consciousness is happy, 
he tries to distribute the knowledge of Kr�J).a everywhere. Since the perfect 
yogi tries to broadcast the importance of becoming Kr�l)a conscious, he is 
the best philanthropist in the world, and he is the dearest servitor of the 
Lord. Na tasmiit kascid me priyakrt tama�. In other words, a devotee of 
the Lord always looks to the welfare of all living entities, and in this way 
he is factually the friend of everyone. He is the best yogi because he does 
not desire perfection in yoga for his personal benefit, but tries for others 
also. He does not envy his fellow living entities. Here is a contrast between 
' 
�

a pure devotee of the Lord and a yogi interested only in his personal 
elevation. The yogi who has withdrawn to a secluded place in order to 
meditate perfectly may not be as perfect as a devotee who is trying his 
best to turn every man toward Kr�IJa consciousness.

Arjuna said: 0 Madhusudana, the system of yoga which you have

PURPORT 
The system of mysticism described by Lord Kr�IJa to Arjuna beginning 
with the words sucau dese and ending with yogi parama"{l is here being 
rejected by Arjuna out of a feeling of inability. It is not possible for an 
ordinary man to leave home and go to a secluded place in the mountains 
or jungles to practice yoga in this age of Kali. The present age is charac­
terized by a bitter struggle for a life of short duration. People are not 
serious about self-realization even by oimple, practical means, and what to 
speak of this clifficult yoga system, which regulates the mode of living, the 
manner of sitting, selection of place, and detachment of the mind from 
material engagements. As a practical man, Arjuna thought it was impossible 
Text 34] 
Sankhya-yoga 
343 
to follow this system of yoga, even though he was favorably endowed in 
many ways. He belonged to the royal family and was highly elevated in 
terms of numerous qualities; he was a great warrior, he had great longevity, 
and, above all, he was the most intimate friend of Lord Kr�va, the Supreme 
Personality of Godhead. Five thousand years ago, Arjuna had much better 
facilities then we do now, yet he refused to accept this system of yoga. In 
fact, we do not find any record in history of his practicing it at any time. 
Therefore this system must be considered generally impossible in this age 
of Kali. Of course it may be possible for some very few, rare men, but for 
the people in general it is an impossible proposal. If this were so five 
thousand years ago, then what of the present day? Those who are imitating 
this yoga system in different so-called schools and societies, although 
complacent, are certainly wasting their time. They are completely in 
ignorance of the desired goal.

elements, it is certainly very difficult to control the mind. Artificially, one 
may establish a mental equilibrium toward both friend and enemy, but 
ultimately no worldly man can do so, for this is more difficult than con­
trolling the raging wind. In the Vedic literatures it is said: 
iitmiinam rathinam viddhi sariram ratham eva ca 
buddhintu siirathim viddhi mana� pragraham eva ca 
indriyiir-i hayiiniih.ur vi�ayiims te�u gocariin 
iitmendriya-mano-yukto bhoktety iihur mani§ir-a�. 
"The individual is the passenger in the car of the material body, and 
intelligence is the driver. Mind is the driving instrument, and the senses 
are the horses. The self is thl).s the enjoyer or sufferer in the association of 
the mind and senses. So it is understood by great thinkers." Intelligence 
is. supposed to direct the mind, but the mind is so strong and obstinate 
that it often overcomes even one's own intelligence. Such a strong mind is 
supposed to be controlled by the practice of yoga, but such practice is 
never practical for a worldly person like Aljuna. And what can we say of 
modern man? The simile used here is appropriate: one cannot capture the 
blowing wind. And it is even more difficult to capture the turbulent mind. 
The easiest way to control the mind, as suggested by Lord Caitanya, is 
chanting "Hare Kr�l).a," the great mantra for deliverance, in all humility. 
The method prescribed is sa vai mana� kr�r-a-padiiravindayo�: one must 
engage one's mind fully in Kr�J).a. Only then will there remain no other 
engagements to agitate the mind.

TRANSLATION 
The Blessed Lord said: 0 mighty-armed son of Kunti, it is undoubtedly 
very difficult to curb the restless mind, but it is possible by constant 
practice and by detachment. 
PURPORT 
The difficulty of controlling the obstinate mind, as expressed by Arjuna, 
is accepted by the Personality of Godhead. But at the same time He 
suggests that by practice and detachment it is possible. What is that 
practice? In the present age no one can observe strict rules and regulations, 
such as placing oneself in a sacred place, focusing the mind on the Super­
soul, restraining the senses and mind, observing celibacy, remaining alone, 
etc. By the practice of Kr�Q.a consciousness, however, one engages in nine 
types of devotional service to the Lord. The first and foremost of such 
devotional engagements is hearing about Kr�Q.a. This is a very powerful 
transcendental method for purging the mind of all misgivings. The more 
one hears about Kr�Q.a, the more one becomes enlightened and detached 
from everything that draws the mind away from Kr�Q.a. By detaching the 
mind from activities not devoted to the Lord, one can very easily learn 
vairiigya. Vairiigya means detachment from matter and engagement of the 
mind in spirit. Impersonal spiritual detachment is more difficult than 
attaching the mind to the activities of Kr�Q.a. This is practical because by 
hearing about Kr�Q.a one becomes automatically attached to the Supreme 
Spirit. This attachment is called paresanubhiiti, spiritual satisfaction. It is 
just like the feeling of sati�Sfaction a hungry man has for every morsel of 
food he eats. Similarly, by discharge of devotional service, one feels tran­
scendental satisfaction as the mind becomes detached from material objec­
tives. It is something like curing a disease by expert treatment and appro­
priate diet. Hearing of the transcendental activities of Lord Kr�Q.a is there­
fore expert treatment for the mad mind, and eating the foodstuff offered 
to Kr�Q.a is the appropriat� diet for the suffering patient. This treatment is 
the process of Kr�Q.a consciousness.

TRANSLATION 
For one whose mind is unbridled, self-realization is difficult work. But 
he whose mind is controlled and who strives by right means is assured of 
success. That is My opinion. 
PURPORT 
The Supreme Personality of Godhead declares that one who does not 
accept the proper treatment to detach the mind from material engagement 
can hardly achieve success in self-realization. Trying to practice yoga while 
engaging the mind in material enjoyment is like trying to ignite a fire while 
pouring water on it. Similarly, yoga practice without mental control is a 
waste of time. Such a show of yoga practice may be materially lucrative, but 
it is useless as far as spiritual realization is concerned. Therefore, the mind 
must be controlled by engaging it constantly in the transcendental loving 
service of the Lord. Unless one is engaged in Krgta consciousness, he can­
not steadily control the mind. A Kr�J).a conscious person easily achieves the 
result of yoga practice without separate endeavor, but a yoga practitioner 
cannot achieve success without becoming Kr�J).a conscious.

Arjuna said: What is the destination of the man of faith who does not 
persevere, who in the beginning takes to the process of self-realization but 
who later desists due to worldly-mindedness and ·thus does not attain per­
fection in mysticism? 
PURPORT 
The path of self-realization or mysticism is described in the Bhagavad­
gitii. The basic principle of self-realization is knowledge that the living en­
tity is not this material body but that he is different from it and that his 
happiness is in eternal life, bliss and knowledge. These are transcendental, 
beyond both body and mind. Self-realization is sought by the path of know­
ledge, the practice of the eightfold system or by bhakti-yoga. In each of 
these processes one has to realize the constitutional position of the living 
entity, his relationship with God, and the� activities_ whereby he can 
reestablish the lost link and achieve the highest perfectional stage of Kr�IJa 
consciousness. Following any of the above-mentioned three methods, one 
is sure to reach the supreme goal sooner or later. This was asserted by the 
Lord in the Second Chapter: even a little endeavor on the transcendental 
path offers a great hope for deliverance. Out of these three methods, the 
path of bhakti-yoga is especially suitable for this age because it is the most 
direct method of God realization. To be doubly assured, Arjuna is asking 
Lord Kr�IJa to confirm His former statement. One may sincerely accept 
the path of self-realization, but the process of cultivation of knowledge 
and the practice of the eightfold yoga system are generally very difficult 
for this age. Therefore, despite constant endeavor, one may -fail for many 
reasons. First of all, one may not be following the process. To pursue the 
�

[Ch. 6 . 
transcendental path is more or less to declare war on illusory energy. Con-
. sequently, whenever a person tries to escape the clutches of the illusory 
energy, she tries to defeat the practitioner by various allurements. A con­
ditioned soul is already allured by the modes of material energy, and there 
is every chance of being allured again, even while performing transcenden­
tal disciplines. This is called yogiit calita-miinasa�: deviation from the 
transcendental path. Atjuna is inquisitive to know the results of deviation 
from the path of self-realization.

PURPORT 
There are two ways to progress. Those who are materialists have no 
interest in Transcendence; therefore they are more interested in material 
advancement by economic development, or in promotion to the higher 
planets by appropriate work. When one takes to the path of '(ranscendence, 
one has to cease all material activities and sacrifice all forms of so-called 
material happiness. If the aspiring transcendentalist fails, then he apparent­
ly loses both ways; in other words, he can enjoy neither material happiness 
nor spiritual success. He has no position; he is like a riven cloud. A cloud

in the sky sometimes deviates from a small cloud and joins a big one. But 
if it cannot join a big one, then it is blown away by the wind and becomes 
a nonentity in the vast sky. The brahmarw� pathi is the path of transcen­
dental realization through knowing oneself to be spiritual in essence, part 
and parcel of the Supreme Lord who is manifested as Brahman, Pa1amatma 
and Bhagavan. Lord Sri Kr�IJ.a is the fullest manifestation of the Supreme 
Absolute Truth, and therefore one who is surrendered to the :5upreme 
Person is a successful transcendentalist. To reach this goal of life through 
Brahman and Paramatma realization takes many, many birth._: Bahiiniirh 
janmaniim ante. Therefore the supermost of transcendental realization is 
bhakti-yoga or Kr�IJ.a consciousness, the direct method.

This is my doubt 0 Kr{!Qa, and I ask You to dispel it completely. But for

PURPORT 
Kr�IJ.a is the perfect knower of past, present and future. In the beginning 
of the Bhagavad-gitii, the Lord said that all living entities exist individually 
in the past, that they exist now in the present, and that they continue to 
retain individual identity in the future, even after liberation from the 
material entanglement. So He has already cleared up the question of the 
350 
Bhagavad-gita As It Is 
(Ch. 6. 
future of the individual living entity. Now, Arjuna wants to know of the 
future of the unsuccessful transcendentalist. No one is equal to or above 
Kr�t:ta, and certainly the so-called great sages and philosophers who are at 
the mercy of material nature cannot equal Him. Therefore the verdict of 
Kr�t:ta is the final and complete answer to all doubts because He knows 
past, present and future perfectly-but no one knows Him. Kr�t:ta and 
Kr�t:ta conscious devotees alone can know what is what.

The. Blessed Lord said: Son of Prtha, a transcendentalist engaged in

PURPORT 
In the Srimad-Bhiigavatam (1.5.17) Sri Narada Muni instructs Vyasadeva 
as follows: 
"

351 
"If someone gives up all material prospects and takes complete shelter of 
the Supreme Personality of Godhead, there is no loss or degradation in any 
way. On the other hand a nondevotee may fully engage in his occupational 
duties and yet not gain anything." For material prospects, there are many 
activities both scriptural and customary. A transcendentalist is supposed 
to give up all material activities for the sake of spiritual advancement in 
life, Kr�va consciousness. One ma:y argue that by Kr�va consciousness one 
may attain the highest perfection if it is completed, but if one does not 
attain such a perfectional stage, then he loses both materially and spiritual­
ly. It is enjoined in the scriptures that one has to suffer the reaction of not 
executing prescribed duties; therefore one who fails to discharge transcen­
dental activities properly becomes subjected to these reactions. The 
Bhiigavatam assures the unsuccessful transcendentalist that there need be 
no worries. Even though he may be subjected to the reaction of not 
perfectly executing prescribed duties, he is still not a loser, because auspi­
cious Kr�va consciousness is never forgotten, and one so engaged will 
continue to be so even if he is lowborn in the next life. On the other 
hand, one who simply follows strictly the prescribed duties need not 
necessarily attain auspicious results if he is lacking in Kr�va consciousness. 
The purport may be understood as follows: humanity may be divided 
into two sections, namely, the regulated and the nonregulated. Those who 
are engaged simply in bestial sense gratifications without knowledge of 
their next life or spiritual salvation belong to the nonregulated section. 
And those who follow the principles of prescribed duties in the scriptures 
are classified amongst the regulated section. The nonregulated section, 
both civilized and noncivilized, educated and noneducated, strong and 
weak, are full of animal propensities. Their activities. are never auspicious 
because, enjoying the animal propensities of eating, sleeping, defending 
an_d mating, they perpetually remain in material existence, which is always 
miserable. On the other hand, those who are regulated by scriptural 
injunctions and thus gradually rise to Kr�va consciousness certainly pro­
gress in life. 
Those who are then following the path of auspiciousness can be divided 
into three sections, namely, l) the followers of scriptural rules and regula­
tions who are enjoying material prosp.erity, 2) those who are trying to

are devotees in Kr�J'.la consciousness. Those who are following the rules 
and regulations of the scriptures for material happiness may be further 
divided into two classes: those who are fruitive workers and those who 
desire no fruit for sense gratification. Those who are after fruitive results 
for sense gratification may be elevated to a higher standard of life-even 
to the higher planets; but still, because they are not free from material 
existence, they are not following the truly auspicious path. The only 
auspicious activities are those which lead one to liberation. Any activity 
which is not aimed at ultimate self-realization or liberation from the 
material bodily concept of life is not at all auspicious. Activity in Kr�J'.la 
consciousness is the only auspicious activity, and anyone who voluntarily 
accepts all bodily discomforts for the sake of making progress on the path 
of Kr�J'.la consciousness can be called a perfect transcendentalist under 
severe austerity. And because the eightfold yoga system is directed toward 
the ultimate realization of Kr�J'.la consciousness, such practice is also aus­
picious, and no one who is trying his best in this matter need fear degra­
dation.

PURPORT 
The unsuccessful yogis are divided into two classes: one is fallen after 
very little progress, and one is fallen after long practice of yoga. The yogi 
who falls after a short period of practice goes to the higher planets where 
pious living entities are allowed to enter. After prolonged life there, he is 
sent back again to this planet, to take birth in the family of a righteous 
briihmap.a va4p.ava or of aristocratic merchants. 
The real purpose of yoga practice is to achieve the highest perfection of 
Kr�l)a consciousness. But those who do not persevere to such an extent 
and fail due to material allurements are allowed, by the grace of the Lord, 
to make full utilization of their material propensities. And after that, they 
are given opportunities to live prosperous lives in righteous or aristocratic 
families. Those who are born in such families may take advantage of the 
facilities and try to elevate themselves to full Kr�l)a consciousness.

spiritual impetus from the very beginning of his life. It is especially the case 
in the iiciirya or gosviimi families. Such families are very learned and de­
voted by tradition and training, and thus they become spiritual masters. In 
India there are many such iiciirya families, but they have now degenerated 
due to insufficient education and training, By the grace of the Lord, there 
are still families that foster transcendentalists generation after generation. 
It is certainly very fortunate to take birth in such families. Fortunately, 
both our spiritual master, Om Vi�Qupada Sri Snmad Bhaktisiddhanta 
Sarasvafi Gosvam1 Maharaja, and our humble self, had the opportunity to 
take birth in such families, by the grace of the Lord, and both of us were 
trained in the devotional service of the Lord from the very beginning of 
our lives. Later on we met by the order of the transcendental system.

family of a good briihma!la and was known as J a(,labharata because he 
always remained secluded and did not talk to anyone. And later on, he was 
discovered as the greatest transcendentalist by King RahiigaiJ.a. From his 
life it is understood that transcendental endeavors, or the practice of yoga, 
never go in vain. By the grace of the Lord the transcendentalist gets repeat­
ed opportunities for complete perfection in Kr�IJ.a consciousness.

PURPORT 
Advanced yogis are not very much attracted to the rituals of the scrip­
tures, but they . automatically become attracted to the yoga principles, 
which can elevate them to complete Kr�Qa co:n.sciousness, the highest yoga 
perfection. In the Srimad-Bhiigavatam (3.33.8 ), such disregard of Vedic 
rituals by the advanced transcendentalists is explained as follows:

"0 my Lord! Persons who chant the holy names of Your Lordship are far, 
far advanced in spiritual life, even if born in families of dog-eaters. Such 
chanters have undoubtedly performed all kinds of austerities and sacrifices, 
bathed in all sacred places, and finished all scriptural studies." 
The famous example of this was presented by. Lord Caitanya, who 
accepted Thakur Haridasa as one of His most important disciples. Although 
. Thakur Haridasa happened to take his birth in a Moslem family, he was 
elevated to the post of niimiiciirya by Lord Caitanya due to his rigidly 
attended principle of chanting three hundred thousand holy names of the 
Lord daily: Hare Kr�J)a, Hare Kr�J)a, Kr�J)a Kr�J)a, Hare Hare/ Hare Rama, 
Hare Rama, Rama Rama, Hare Hare. And because he chanted the holy 
name of the Lord constantly, it is understood that in his previous life he 
must have passed through all the ritualistic methods of the Vedas, known 
as sabda-brahman. Unless, therefore, one is purified, one cannot take to the 
principle of Kr�J)a consciousness nor become engaged in chanting the holy 
name of the Lord, Hare Kr�J)a.

PURPORT 
A person born in a particularly righteous, aristocratic or sacred family 
becomes conscious of his favorable condition for executing yoga practice. 
With determination, therefore, he begins his unfinished task, and thus he 
completely cleanses himself of all material contaminations. When he is 
finally free from all contaminations, he attains the supreme perfection­
Kr�J).a consciousness. Kr�J).a consciousness is the perfect stage of being freed 
of all contaminations. This is confirmed in the Bhagavad-gita: 
ye�iim tvanta-gatam piipam janiiniim puvya-karmariim 
te dvandva-moha-nirmuktii bhajante miim dglha-vratiifl

pletely freed from all contaminations, and from all illusory dualities, one 
then becomes engaged in the transcendental loving service of the Lord."

PURPORT 
When we speak of yoga we refer to linking up our consciousness with the 
Supreme Absolute Truth. Such a process is named differently by various 
358 
Bhagavad -gita As It Is 
(Ch. 6. 
practitioners in terms of the particular method adopted. When the linking 
up process is predominantly in fruitive activities, it is called karma-yoga, 
when it is predominantly empirical, it is called jiiana-yoga, and when it is 
predominantly in a devotional relationship with the Supreme Lord, it is 
called bhakti-yoga. Bhakti-yoga or Kr�va consciousness is the ultimate 
perfection of all yogas, as will be explained in the next verse. The Lord has 
confirmed herein the superiority of yoga, but He has not mentioned that 
it is better than bhakti-yoga. Bhakti-yoga is full spiritual knowledge, and as 
such, nothing can excel it. Asceticism without self-knowledge is imperfect. 
Empiric knowledge without surrender to the Supreme Lord is also imper­
fect. And fruitive work without Kr�va consciousness is a waste of time. 
Therefore, the most highly praised form of yoga performance mentioned 
here is bhakti-yoga, and this is still more clearly explained in the next verse.

PURPORT 
The word bhajate is significant here. Bhajate has its root in the verb bhaj, 
which is used when there is need of service. The English word "worship" 
Text 47] 
Sarikhya-yoga 
359 
cannot be used in the same sense as bhaja. Worship means to adore, 
or to show respect and honor to the worthy one. But service with rove and 
faith is especially meant for the Supreme Personality of Godhead. One can 
avoid worshiping a respectable man or a demigod and may be called dis­
courteous, but one cannot avoid serving the Supreme Lord without being 
thoroughly condemned. Every living entity is part and parcel of the Su­
preme Personality of Godhead, and thus every living entity is intended to 
serve the Supreme Lord by his own constitution. Failing to do this, he 
falls down. The Bhiigavatam confirms this as follows: 
ya e§iim pum§am siik§iid iitma-prabhavam iSvaram 
na bhajanty avajiinanti sthiiniid bhra§[ii patanty adhaf.l,. 
"Anyone who does not render service and neglects his duty unto the Pri­
meval Lord, who is the source of all living entities, will certainly fall down 
from his constitutional position." 
In this verse also the word bhajanti is used. Therefore, bhajanti is appli­
cable to the Supreme Lord only, whereas the word "worship" can be 
applied to demigods or to any other common living entity. The word 
avajiinanti, used in this verse of Srimad-Bhiigavatam, is also found in the 
Bhagavad-gitii: avajiinanti miim mii�hiif.l,: "Only the fools and rascals deride 
the Supreme Personality of Godhead Lord Kr�J).a." Such fools take it upon 
themselves to write commentaries on the Bhagavad-gitii without an attitude 
of service to the Lord. Consequently they cannot properly distinguish be­
tween the word bhajanti and the word "worship." 
The culmination of all kinds of yoga practices lies in bhakti-yoga. All 
other yogas are but means to come to the ppint of bhakti in bhakti-yoga. 
Yoga actually means bhakti-yoga; all other yogas are progressions toward 
the destination of bhakti-yoga. From the beginning of karma-yoga to the 
end of bhakti-yoga is a long way to self-realization. Karma-yoga, without 
fruitive results, is the beginning of this path. When karma-yoga increases in 
knowledge and renunciation, the stage is called jiiiina-yoga. When jiiiina­
yoga increases in meditation on the Supersoul by different physical pro­
. cesses, and the mind is on Him, it is called a§[iinga-yoga. And, when one 
surpasses the a§{iinga-yoga and comes to the point of the Supreme Person­
ality of Godhead Kr�Q.a, it is called bhakti-yoga, the culmination. F;tetually, 
bhakti-yoga is the ultimate goal, but to analyze bhakti-yoga minutely one 
has to understand these other yogas. The yogi who is progressive is there­
fore on the true path of eternal good fortune. One who sticks to a parti­
cular point and does not make further progress is called by that particular 
name: karma-yogi, jiiiina-yogi or dhyiina-yogi, riija-yogi, hafha-yogi, etc. 
] 
360 
Bhagavad-gita As It Is 
[Ch. 6 
If one is fortunate enough to come to the point of bhakti-yoga, it is to be 
understood that he has surpassed all the other yogas. Therefore, to become 
Kr�r;ta conscious is the highest stage of yoga, just as, when we speak of 
Himalayan, we refer to the world's highest mountains, of which the 
highest peak, Mount Everest, is considered to be the culmination. 
It is by great fortune that one comes to Kr�r:ta consciousness on the path 
of bhakti-yoga to become well situated according to the Vedic direction. 
The ideal yogi concentrates his attention on Kr�l}.a, who is called 
Syamasundara, who is as beautifully colored as a cloud, whose lotus-like 
face is as effulgent as the sun, whose dress is brilliant with jewels and 
whose body is flower garlanded. Illuminating all sides is His gorgeous 
luster, which is called the brahmajyoti. He incarnates in different forms 
such as Rama, Nrsini.ha, V araha and Kr�r;ta, the Supreme Personality of 
Godhead, and He descends like a human being, as the son of Mother 
Y asoda, and He is known as Kr�r;ta, Govinda and Vasudeva. He is the 
perfect child, husband, friend and master, and He is full with all opulences · 
and transcendental qualities. If one remains fully conscious of these fea­
tures of the Lord, he is called the highest yogi. 
This stage of highest perfection in yoga can be attained only by bhakti­
yoga, as is confirmed in all Vedic literature: 
yasya deve parii bhak tir yathii deve tathii gurau. 
tasyaite kathita hy artha[l, prakasante mahatmana[l,. 
"Only unto those great souls who have implicit faith in both the Lord 
and the spiritual master are all the imports of Vedic knowledge auto­
matically revealed." 
Bhaktir asya bhajanarh tadihiimutropiidhi 
nairiisyeniimu§min mana[!, 
kalpanam; etad eva nai§karmyam. "Bhakti means devotional service to the 
Lord which is free from desire for material profit, either in this life or in 
the next. Devoid of such inclinations, one should fully absorb the mind in 
the Supreme. That is the purpose of nai§karmya. ,, 
These are some of the means for performance of bhakt� or l<f�r;ta 
consciousness, the highest perfectional stage of the yoga system. 
Thus end the Bhaktivedanta Purports to the Sixth Chapter of the 
Snmad-Bhagavad-gita in the matter of Sailkhya-yoga Brahma-vidya.

TRANSLATION 
Now hear, 0 son of Prtha [ Arjuna ], how by practicing yoga in full 
consciousness of Me, with mind attached to Me, you can know Me in full, 
free from doubt. 
PURPORT 
In this Seventh Chapter of Bhagavad-gitii., the nature of Kr�l).a conscious­
ness is fully described. Kr�l).a is full in all opulences, and how He manifests 
such opulences is described herein. Also, four kinds of fortunate people 
who become attached to Kr�l).a, and four kinds of unfortunate people who 
never take to Kr�l).a are described in this chapter. 
In the first six chapters of Bhagavad-gitii., the living entity has been 
described as nonmaterial spirit soul which is capable of elevating himself 
to self-realization by different types of yogas. At the end of the Sixth 
Chapter, it has been clearly stated that the steady concentration of the 
mind upon Kr�l).a, or in other words Kr�l).a consciousness, is the highest 
form of all yoga. By concentrating one's mind upon Kr�l).a, one is able to 
know the Absolute Truth completely, but not otherwise. Impersonal 
brahmajyoti or localized Paramatma realization is not perfect knowledge 
of the Absolute Truth because it is partial. Full and scientific knowledge 
is Kr�l).a, and everything is revealed to the person in Kr�l).a consciousness. 
In complete Kr�l).a consciousness one knows that Kr�l).a is ultimate know­
ledge beyond any doubts. Different types of yoga are only steppingstones 
on the path of Kr�l).a consciousness. One who takes directly to Kr�l).a con­
sciousness automatically knows about brahmajyoti and Paramatma in full. 
By practice of Kr�l).a consciousness yoga, one can know everything in full­
namely the Absolute Truth, the living entities, the material nature, and 
their manifestations with paraphernalia. 
One should therefore begin yoga practice as directed in the last verse of 
the Sixth Chapter. Concentration of the mind upon Kr�l).a the Supreme is 
made possible by prescribed devotional service in nine different forms, of 
which sravaflam is the first and most important. The Lord therefore says 
to Arjuna, "tat snw," or "Hear from Me." No one can be a greater 
authority than Kr�l).a, and therefore by hearing from Him one receives the 
greatest opportunity for progress in Kr�l).a consciousness. One has there� 
fore to learn from Kr�l).a directly or from a pure devotee of Kr�l).a-and 
not from a nondevotee upstart, puffed up with academic education. 
In the Srimad"Bhii.gavatam this process of understanding Kr�l).a, the 
Text 2] 
Knowledge of the Absolute 
363 
Supreme Personality of Godhead, the Absolute Truth, is described in the 
Second Chapter of the First Canto as follows: 
srrwatiirh sva-kathiirh kmw� pur-ya-sravar-a-kirtana� 
h[dyanta�stho hy abhadriir-i vidhunoti suh[t satiim. 
na§ta-praye§v abhadre§U nityarh bhiigavata-sevayii 
bhagavaty uttama-sloke bhaktir bhavati nai§thiki. 
tadii rajas-tamo-bhiivii� kiima-lobhiidayas ca ye

bhidyate hrdaya-granthis chidyante sarva-sarhsayii� 
k§iyante ciisya karmiir-i dr§ta eviitmaniSvare. 
"To hear about Kr�J}.a from Vedic literatures, or to hear from Him 
directly through the Bhagavad-gitii, is itself righteous activity. And for one 
who hears about Kr�J}.a, Lord Kr�l}.a, who is dwelling in everyone's heart, 
acts as a best-wishing friend and purifies the devotee who constantly 
engages in hearing of Him. In this way, a devotee naturally develops his 
dormant transcendental knowledge. As he hears more about Kr�J}.a from 
the Bhiigavatam and from the devotees, he becomes fixed in the devotional 
service of the Lord. By development of devotional service one becomes 
freed from the modes of passion and ignorance, and thus material lusts and 
avarice are diminished. When these impurities are wiped away, the candi­
date remains steady in his position of pure goodness, becomes enlivened 
by devotional service and understands the science of God perfectly. Thus 
bhakti-yoga severs the hard knot of material affection and enables one to 
come at once to the stage of 'asarhsayarh samagram,' understanding of 
the Supreme Absolute Truth Personality of Godhead." (Bhiig. 1.2.17-21) 
Therefore only by hearing from Kr�J}.a or from His devotee in Kr�J}.a 
consciousness can one understand the science of Kr�J}.a.

PURPORT 
Complete knowledge includes knowledge of the phenomenal world and 
·the spirit behind it. The source of both of them is transcendental know­
. ledge. The Lord wants to explain the above-mentioned system of know­
. Jedge because Aijuna is Kr�l).a's confidential devotee and friend. In the 
. 'h¢ginning of the Fourth Chapter this explanation was given by the Lord, 
· and it is again confirmed here: complete knowledge can be achieved only by 
the ·devotee of the Lord directly from the Lord in disciplic succession. 
Therefore one should he intelligent enough to know the source of all 
knowledg�? who is the cause of all causes and the only object for medita-
tion in al�- 'types of yoga practices. When the cause of all causes becomes 
known, then everything knowable becomes known, and .nothing remains

There are various grades of men, and out of many thousands one may

is the self, what is the body, and what is the Absolute Truth. Generally 
mankind is simply engaged in the animal propensities, namely eating, 
sleeping, defending and mating, and hardly anyone is interested in' tran­
scendental knowledge. The first six chapters of the Gitii are meant for those 
who are interested in transcendental knowledge, in understa'lding the self, · 
the Superself and the process of realization by jiiiina-yoga, dhyiina-yoga, .. 
and discrimination of the self from matter. However, Kr�Q.a can onJy;b�: �.

Bhagavad-git� As It Is 
[Ch. 7 
· 
without knowledge of bhakti may be easy, but when it is practiced fac­
tually according to the rules and regulations, the speculative scholars and 
philosophers fall away from the path. Srila Riipa Gosvaml writes in his 
Bhak ti-rasiimrta-sindhu: 
sruti-smrti-puriip,iidi-paficariitra-vidhirh vinii 
aikiintiki harer bhaktir utpiitiiyaiva kalpate. 
"Devotional service of the Lord that ignores the authorized Vedic litera­
tures like the Upan4ads, Puriip,as, Niirada-paficariitra, etc., is simply an· 
unnecessary disturbance in society." 
It is not possible for the Brahman realized impersonalist or the 
Paramatma realized yogi to understand Kr�r:ta the Supreme Personality of 
Godhead as the son of mother Y asoda or the charioteer of Arj una. Even 
the great demigods are sometimes confused about Kr�r:ta: "muhyanti _yat 
siiraya(l.," "miirh tu veda na kascana." "No one knows Me as I am," the Lord 
says. And if one does know Him, then "sa mahiitmii sudurlabha[l,." "Such 
a great soul is very rare." Therefore unless one practices devotional service 
to the Lord, he cannot know Kr�r:ta as He is (tattvata(l.J, even though one is 
a great scholar or philosopher. Only the pure devotees can know something 
of the inconceivable transcendental qualities in Kr�r:ta, in the cause of all 
causes, in His omnipotence and opulence, and in His wealth, fame, strength, 
beauty, knowledge and renunciation, because Krwa is benevolently in­
clined to His devotees. He is the last word in Brahman realization, and the 
devotees alone can realize Him as He is. Therefore it is said: 
ata(l. sri-knra-niimiidi na bhaved griihyam indriyai(l. 
sevonmukhe hi jihviidau svayam eva sphuraty ada(!. 
"No one can understand Kr�r:ta as He is by the blunt material senses. But 
He reveals Himself to the devotees, being pleased with them for their 
transcendental loving service unto Him." (Padma Puriip,a)

Earth, water, fire, air, ether, mind, intelligence and false ego-altogether

PURPORT 
The science of God analyzes the constitutional position of God and His 
diverse energies. Material nature is called prakrti, or the energy of the Lord 
in His different puru§a incarnations (expansions) as described in the 
Svatvata Tantra: 
v�p.os tu trip.i ropiip.i puru§iikhyiiny atho vidu{l 
ekantu mahata{l sr�!r dviti:yarn tv appa-samsthitam

"For material creation, Lord Kr�Qa's plenary expansion assumes three 
Vi�QUS. The first one, Maha-Vi�Qu, creates the total material energy, known 
as mahat-tattva. The second, Garhhodakasayi Vi!lQU, enters into all the 
universes to create diversities in each of them. The third, K�lrodakasayi 
Vi!li}U, is diffused as the all-pervading Supersoul in all the universes and is 
known as Paramatma, who is present even within the atoms. Anyone who 
knows these three Vi!?J}US can he liberated from material entanglement." 
This material world is a temporary manifestation of one of the energies 
of the Lord. All the activities of the material world are directed by these 
three Vi�J}u expansions of Lord Kr�Qa. These Puru�as are called incarna­
tions. Generally one who does not know the science of God (Kr�Qa) 
assumes that this material world is for the enjoyment of the living entities 
and that the living entities are the causes (Puru§as), controllers and enjoyers 
of the material energy. According to Bhagavad-gitii this atheistic conclu­
sion is false. In the verse under discussion it is ::;tated that Kr�Qa is the 
original cause of the material manifestation. Srimad-Bhiigavatam also 
confirms this. The ingredients of the material, manifestation are separated 
�

368 
Bhagavad-gita As It Is 
[Ch. 7 
energies of the Lord. Even the brahmajyoti, which is the ultimate goal of 
the impersonalists, is a spiritual energy manifested in the spiritual sky. 
There are no spiritual diversities in b rahmajyoti as there are in the 
V aikul).thalokas, and the impersonalist accepts this b rahmajyoti as the 
ultimate eternal goal. The Paramatma manifestation is also a temporary 
all-pervasive aspect of the K�irodakasay'i Vi�l).u. The Paramatma manifes­
tation is not eternal in the spiritual world. Therefore the factual Absolute 
Truth is the Supreme Personality of Godhead Kr�l).a. He is the complete 
energetic person, and He possesses different separated and internal energies. 
In the material energy, the principal manifestations are eight, as above 
mentioned. Out of these, the first five manifestations, namely earth, 
water, fire, air and sky, are called the five gigantic creations or the gross 
creations, within which the five sense objects are included. They are the 
manifestations of physical sound, touch, form, taste and smell. Material 
science comprises these ten items and nothing more. But the other three 
items, namely mind, intelligence and false ego, are neglected by the 
materialists. Philosophers who deal with mental activities are also not 
perfect in knowledge because they do not know the ultimate source, 
Kr�l).a. The false ego-"1 am," and "It is mine," which constitute the 
basic principle of material existence-includes ten sense organs for material 
activities. Intelligence refers to the total material creation, called the 
mahat-tattva. Therefore from the eight separated energies of the Lord are 
manifest the twenty-four elements of the material world, which are the 
subject matter of siinkh ya atheistic philosophy; they are originally off­
shoots from Kr�l).a's energies and are separated from Him, but atheistic 
siinkhya philosophers with a poor fund of knowledge do not know Kr�l).a 
as the cause of all causes. The subject matter for discussion in the siihkhya 
philosophy is only the manifestation of the external energy of Kr�l).a, as it 
is described in the Bhagavad-gitii.

TRANSLATION 
Besides this inferior nature, 0 mighty-armed Arjuna, there is a superior 
energy of Mine, which are all living entities who are struggling with mate­
rial nature and are sustaining the universe. 
PURPORT 
Here it is clearly mentioned that living entities belong to the superior 
nature (or energy) of the Supreme Lord. The inferior energy is matter 
manifested in different elements, namely earth, water, fire, air, ether, 
mind, intelligence and false ego. Both forms of material nature, namely 
gross (earth, etc.) and subtle (mind, etc.), are products of the inferior 
energy. The living entities, who are exploiting these inferior energies for 
different purposes, are the superior energy of the Supreme Lord, and it is 
due to this energy that the entire material world functions. The cosmic 
manifestation has no power to act unless it is moved by the superior energy, 
the living entity. Energies are always controlled by the energetic, and there­
fore living entities are always controlled by the Lord-they have no inde­
pendent existence. They are never equally powerful, as unintelligent men 
think. The distinction between the living entities and the Lord is described 
in Srimad-Bhiigavatam as follows (10.87.30): 
aparimita dhruvas tanubhrto yadi sarva-gatas 
tarhim na siisyateti niyamo dhruva netarathii 
ajani ca yanmayam tad avimucya niyantr 
bhavet samam anujanatarh yad-amatam mata-du§tataya 
"0 Supreme Eternal! If the embodied living entities were eternal and all­
pervading like You, then they would not be under Your control. But if the 
living entities are accepted as minute energies of Your Lordship, then they 
are at once subject to Your supreme control. Therefore real liberation en­
tails surrender by the living entities to Your control, and that surrender 
will make them happy. In that constitutional position only can they be 
controlle�s. Therefore, men with limited knowledge who advocate the 
370 
Bhagavad-glta As It Is 
[Ch. 7 
monistic theory that God and the living entities are equal in all respects are 
actually misleading themselves and others." 
The Supreme Lord Kr�l).a is the only controller, and all living entities are 
controlled by Him. These living entities are His superior energy because 
the quality of their existence is one and the same with the Supreme, but 
they are never equal to the Lord in quantity of power. While exploiting 
the gross and subtle inferior energy (matter), the superior energy (the living 
entity) forgets his real spiritual mind and intelligence. This forgetfulness is 
due to the influence of matter upon the living entity. But when the living 
entity becomes free from the influence of the illusory material energy, he 
attains the stage called muk ti, or liberation. The false ego, under the in­
fluence of material illusion, thinks, "I am matter, and material acquisitions 
are mine." His actual position is realized when he is liberated from all mate­
rial ideas, including the conception of his becoming one in all respects 
with God. Therefore one may conclude that the Gitii confirms the living 
entity to be only one of the multi-energies of Kr�l).a; and when this energy 
is freed from material contamination, it becomes fully Kr�l).a conscious, or 
liberated.

PURPORT 
Everything that exists is a product of matter and spirit. Spirit is the basic 
field of creation, and matter is created by spirit. Spirit is not created at a 
certain stage of material development. Rather, this material world is mani­
fested only on the basis of spiritual energy. This material body is developed 
because spirit is present within matter; a child grows gradually to boyhood 
and then to manhood because of that superior energy, spirit soul, being 
present. Similarly, the entire cosmic manifestation of the gigantic universe 
is developed because of the presence of the Supersoul, Vi�l).U. Therefore 
spirit and matter, which combine together to manifest this gigantic univer­
sal form, are originally two energies of the Lord, and consequently the Lord 
is the original Cl!use of everything. A fragmental part and parcel of the 
Lord, namely, the living entity, may by manipulation of material energy 
construct a skyscraper, factory or city, but he cannot create matter out 
of nothing, and he certainly cannot construct a planet or a universe. The 
cause of the universe is the Supersoul, Kr�va, the supreme creator of all 
individual souls and the original cause of all causes, as the Katha Upani§ad 
confirms: nityo nityiiniirit cetanas cetaniiniim.

PURPORT 
There is a common controversy over whether the Supreme Absolute 
Truth is personal or impersonal As far as Bhagavad-gitii is concerned, the 
Absolute Truth is the Personality of Godhead Sri Kr�JJ.a, and this is 
confirmed in every step. In this verse, in particular, it is stressed that the 
Absolute Truth is a person. That the Personality of Godhead is the 
Supreme Absolute Truth is also the affirmation of the Brahma-sarhhitii: 
iSvara� parama� kmw� sac-cid-iinanda-vigraha�; that is, the Supreme 
Absolute Truth Personality of Godhead is Lord Kr�JJ.a, who is the primeval 
Lord, the reservoir of all pleasure, Govinda, and the eternal form of 
complete bliss and knowledge. These authorities leave no doubt that the 
Absolute Truth is the Supreme Person, the cause of all causes; The imper­
sonalist, however, argues on the strength of the Vedic version given in the 
Svetiisvatara Upani§ad: tato yad uttaratararh tad ariipam aniimayarh ya 
etad vidur amrtiis te bhavanti athetare du�kham eviipi yanti. "In the mate­
rial world Brahma, the primeval living entity within the universe, is under­
stood to be the supreme amongst the demigods, human beings and lower 
animals. But beyond Brahma there is the Transcendence who has no mate­
rial form and is free from all material contaminations. Anyone who can 
know Him also becomes transcendental, but those who do not know Him 
suffer the miseries of the material world." 
The impersortalist puts more stress on the word ariipam. But this 
ariipam is not impersonal. It indicates the transcendental form of eternity, 
bliss and knowledge as described in the Brahma.-sarithitii quoted above. 
Other verses in the Svetiisvatara Upani§ad substantiate this as follows: 
vediiham etarit puru§arit mahiintam iiditya�varr-arit tamasa� parastiit 
tam eva vidviin amrta iha bhavati niinya� panthii vidyate ayaniiya 
yasmiit pararit niiparam asti kiiicid yasmiinniipiyo na jyiiyo 'sti kiiicit 
"I know that Supreme Personality of Godhead who is transcendental to 
all material conceptions of darkness. Only he who knows Him can 
transcend the bonds of birth and death. There is no way for liberation 
other than this knowledge of that Supreme Person. 
"There is no truth superior to that Supreme Person because He is the 
supermost. He is smaller than the smallest, and He is greater than the 
greatest. He is situated as a silent tree, and He illumines the transcendental 
sky, and as a tree spreads its roots, He spreads His extensive energies." 
From these verses one concludes that the Supreme Absolute Truth is

the Supreme Personality of Godhead who is all-pervading by His multi­
energies, both material .and spiritual.

0 son of Kunti [ Arjuna], I am the taste of water, the light of the sun 
and the moon, the syllable om in the Vedic mantras; I am the sound in 
ether and ability in man. 
PURPORT 
This verse explains how the Lord is all-pervasive by His diverse 
material and spiritual energies. The Supreme Lord can be preliminarily 
perceived by His different energies, and in this way He is realized 
impersonally. As the demigod in the sun is a person and is perceived 
by his all-pervading energy, the sunshine, similarly, the Lord, although 
in His eternal abode, is perceived by His all-pervading, diffusive energies. 
The taste of water is the active principle of water. No one likes to drink 
sea water because the pure taste of water is mixed with salt. Attraction 
for water depends on the purity of the taste, and this pure taste is one 
of the energies of the Lord. The impersonalist perceives the presence 
of the Lord in water by its taste, and the personalist also glorifies the 
Lord for His kindly supplying water to quench man's thirst. That is the 
374 
Bhagavad-gita As It Is 
[Ch. 7 
way of perceiving the Supreme. Practically speaking, there is no conflict 
between personalism and impersonalism. One who knows God knows 
that the impersonal conception and personal conception are simultaneously 
present in everything and that there is no contradiction. Therefore Lord 
�.· 
Caitanya established His sublime doctrine: acintya-bheda and abheda­
tattvam -simultaneously one and different. 
The light of the sun and the moon is also originally emanating from the 
brahmajyoti, which is the impersonal effulgence of the Lord. Similarly 
pracwva or the omkiira transcendental sound used in the beginning of 
every Vedic hymn to address the Supreme Lord also emanates from Him. 
Because the impersonalists are very much afraid of addressing the 
Supreme Lord Kw;ta by His innumerable names, they prefer to vibrate 
the transcendental sound omkiira. But they do not realize that omkiira is 
the sound representation of Kr�l}a. The jurisdiction of Kr�l}a consciousness 
extends everywhere, and one who knows Kr�l}a consciousness is blessed. 
Those who do not know Kr�J}a are if! illusion, and so knowledge of Krwa 
is liberation, and ignorance of Him is bondage.

Purzya means that which is not decomposed; purzya is original. Every­
thing in the material world has a certain flavor or fragrance, as the flavor 
and fragrance in a flower, or in the earth, in water, in fire, in air, etc. 
The uncontaminated flavor, the original flavor, which permeates everything, 
is Kr�va. Similarly, everything has a particular original taste, and this 
taste can be �hanged by the mixture of chemicals. So everything original 
has some smell, some fragrance, and some taste. Vibhiiva means fire. 
Without fire we cannot run factories, we cannot cook, etc., and that fire 
is Kr�va. The heat in the fire is Kr�va. According to Vedic medicine, 
indigestion is due to a low temperature in the belly. So even for digestion 
fire is needed. In Kr�va consciousness we become aware that earth, 
· 
water, fire, air and every active principle, all chemicals and all material 
elements are due to Kr�va. The duration of man's life is also due to 
Knva. Therefore by the grace of Kr�va, man can prolong his life or 
diminish it. So Kr�va consciousness is active in every sphere.

Bhagavad-gita As It Is 
[Ch. 7 
PURPORT 
Bijam means seed; Krgta is the seed of everything. In contact with 
material nature, the seed fructifies into various living entities, movable 
and inert. Birds, beasts, men and many other living creatures are moving 
living entities; trees and plants, however, are inert-they cannot move, but 
only stand. Every entity is contained within the scope of 8,400,000 
species of life; some of them are moving and some of them are inert. In 
all cases, however, the seed of their life is Kr�Q.a. As stated in Vedic 
literature, Brahman, or the Supreme Absolute Truth, is that from which 
everything is emanating. Kr�Q.a is Parabrahman, the Supreme Spirit. 
Brahman is impersonal and Parabrahman is personal. Impersonal Brahman 
is situated in the personal aspect-that is stated in Bhagavad-gitii. 
'
There­
fore, originally, Kr�Q.a is the source of everything. He is the root. As the 
root of a tree maintains the whole tree, Kr�Q.a, being the original root of all 
things, maintains everything in this material manifestation. This is also 
confirmed in the Vedic literature. Yato vii imiini bhutiini jiiyante. "The 
Supreme Absolute Truth is that from which everything is born." He is 
the prime eternal among all eternals. He is the supreme living entity of all 
living entities, and He alone is maintaining all life. Kr�Q.a also says that He 
is the root of all intelligence. Unless a person is intelligent he cannot 
understand the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Kr�Q.a.

emanations from the Supreme Lord, Kr�t:J.a, He is not subject to them. For

lawmaker, is not subject to that law. Similarly, all the modes of material 
nature-goodness, passion and ignorance-are emanations from the Supreme 
Lord Kr�t:J.a, but Kr�t:J.a is not· subject to material nature. Therefore He is 
nirgurw, which means that these guras, or modes, although issuing from 
Him, do not affect Him. That is one of the special characteristics of 
Bhagavan, or the Supreme Personality of Godhead.

bewildered.

types of psychic and biological activities accordingly. There are four 
classes of men functioning in the three material modes of nature. Those 
who are purely in the mode of goodness are called briihmapas. Those who 
are purely in the mode of passion are called k§atriyas. Those who are in 
the modes of both passion and ignorance are called vaiSyas. Those who are 
completely in ignorance are called siidras. And those who are less than 
that are animals or animal life. However, these designations are not 
permanent. I may either be a briihmar.a, k§atriya, vaiSya or whatever-in 
any case, this life is temporary. But although life is temporary and we do 
not know what we are going to be in the next life, still, by the spell of this 
illusory energy, we consider ourselves in the light of this bodily conception 
of life, and we thus think that we are American, Indian, Russian or 
briihmar.a, Hindu, Muslim, etc. And if we become entangled with the 
modes of material nature, then we forget the Supr((me Personality of 
Godhead who is behind all these modes. So Lord Kr�J}.a says that men, 
deluded by these three modes of nature, do not understand that behind 
the material background is the Supreme Godhead. 
There are many different kinds of living entities-human beings, demi­
gods, animals, etc.-and each and every one of them is under the influence 
of material nature, and all of them have forgotten the transcendent 
Personality of Godhead. Those who are in the modes of passion and ig­
norance, and even those who are in the mode of goodness, cannot go 
beyond the impersonal Brahman conception of the Absolute Truth. They 
are bewildered before the Supreme Lord in His personal feature, which 
possesses all beauty, opulence, knowledge, strength, fame and renuncia· 
tion. When even those who are in goodness cannot understand, what hope 
is there for those in passion and ignorance? Kr�va consciousness is tran­
scendental to all these three modes of material nature, and those who are 
truly established inKr�va consciousness are actually liberated.

TRANSLATION 
This divine energy of Mine, consisting of the three modes of material 
nature, is difficult to overcome. But those who have surrendered unto Me 
can easily cross beyond it. 
PURPORT 
The Supreme Personality of Godhead has innumerable energies, and all 
these energies are divine. Although the living entities are part of His ener­
gies and are therefore divine, due to contact with material energy, their 
original superior power is covered. Being thus covered by material energy, 
one cannot possibly overcome its influence. As previously stated, both 
the material and spiritual natures, being emanations from the Supreme 
Personality of Godhead, are eternal. The living entities belong to the 
eternal superior nature of the Lord, but due to contamination by the 
inferior nature, matter, their illusion is also eternal. The conditioned soul 
is therefore called nitya-baddha, or eternally conditioned. No one can 
trace out the history of his becoming conditioned at a certain date in 
material history. Consequently, his release from the clutches of material 
nature is very difficult, even though that material nature is an inferior 
energy, because material energy is ultimately conducted by the supreme 
will, which the living entity cannot overcome. Inferior material nature is 
defined herein as divine nature due to its divine connection and movement 
by the divine will. Being conducted by divine will, material nature, although 
inferior, acts so wonderfully in the construction and destruction of the 
cosmic manifestation. The Vedas confirm this as follows: 
mayam tu prakrti'!l vidyan mayinam tu mahesvaram. 
"Although mayii [illusion] is false or temporary, the background of maya 
is the supreme magician, the Personality of Godhead, who is Mahesvara, 
the supreme controller." 
Another meaning of gurta is rope; it is to be understood that the con­
ditioned soul is tightly tied by the ropes of illusion. A man bound by the 
hands and feet cannot free himself-he must be helped by a person who is 
Text 15] 
Knowledge of the Absolute 
381 
unbound. Because the bound cannot help the bound, the rescuer must be 
liberated. Therefore, only Lord Kr�IJ.a, or His bona fide representative the 
spiritual master, can release the conditioned soul. Without such superior 
help, one cannot be freed from the bondage of material nature. Devotional 
service, or Kr�IJ.a consciousness, can help one gain such release. Kr�IJ.a, 
being the Lord of illusory energy, can order this insurmountable energy 
to release the conditioned soul. He orders this release out of His causeless 
mercy on the surrendered soul and out of His paternal affection for the 
living entity who is originally a beloved son of the Lord. Therefore surren­
der unto the lotus feet of the Lord is the only means to get free from the 
clutches of the stringent material nature. 
The words miim eva are also significant. Miim means unto Kr�IJ.a (Vi�IJ.u) 
only, and not Brahma or Siva. Although Brahma and Siva are greatly 
elevated and are almost on the level of Vi�J).U, it is not possible for such 
incarnations of riijo-gur-a (passion) and tamo-gur-a (ignorance) to release 
the conditioned soul from the clutches of miiyii. In other words, both 
Brahma and Siva are also under the influence of miiyii. Only Vi�J).u is the 
master of miiyii; therefore He can alone give release to the conditioned 
soul. The Vedas confirm this in the phrase tvam eva viditvii or "Freedom is 
possible only by understanding Kr�IJ.a." Even Lord Siva affirms that 
liberation can be achieved only by the mercy of Vi�J).U. Lord Siva says: 
mukti-pradiitii sarve§iirh vi§r-ur eva na samsaya{l. 
"There is no doubt that Vi�J).U is the deliverer of liberation for everyone."

TRANSLATION 
Those miscreants who are grossly foolish, lowest among mankind, whose 
knowledge is stolen by illusion, and who partake of the atheistic nature 
of demons, do not surrender unto Me. 
PURPORT 
It is said in Bhagavad-gita that simply by surrendering oneself unto the 
lotus feet of the Supreme Personality Kr�J}.a, one can surmount the 
stringent laws of material nature. At this point a question arises: How is it 
that educated philosophers, scientists, businessmen, administrators and an 
the leaders of ordinary men do not surrender to the lotus feet of Sri Kr�J}.a, 
the all-powerful Personality of Godhead? Mukti, or liberation from the 
laws of material nature, is sought by the leaders of mankind in different 
ways and with great plans and perseverance for a great many years and 
births. But if that liberation is possible by simply surrendering unto the 
lotus feet of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, then why don't these 
intelligent and hard-working leaders adopt this simple method? 
The Gita answers this question very frankly. Those really learned leaders 
of society like Brahma, Siva, Kapila, the Kumaras, Manu, Vyasa, Devala, 
�sita, J anaka, Prahlada, Bali, and later on Madhvacarya, Ramanujacarya, 
Sri Caitanya and many others-who are faithful philosophers, politicians, 
educators, scientists, etc.-surrender to the lotus feet of the Supreme 
Person, the all-powerful authority. Those who are not actually philoso­
phers, scientists, educators, administrators, etc., but who pose themselves 
as such for material gain, do. not accept the plan or path of the Supreme 
Lord. They have no idea of God; they simply manufacture their own 
worldly plans and consequently complicate the problems of material 
existence in their vain attempts to solve them. Because material energy 
(nature) is so powerful, it can resist the unauthorized plans of the atheists 
and baffle the knowledge of "planning commissions." 
The atheistic plan-makers are described herein by the word du§krtina, 
or "miscreants. " Krtina means one who has performed meritorious work. 
The atheist planmaker is sometimes very intelligent and meritorious also, 
Text 15] 
Knowledge of the Absolute 
383 
because any gigantic plan, good or bad, must take intelligence to execute. 
But because the atheist's brain is improperly utilized in opposing the plan:· 
of the Supreme Lord, the ath�istic planmaker is called du§krtina, which 
indicates that his intelligence and efforts are misdirected. 
In the Gitii it is clearly mentioned that material energy works fully under 
the direction of the Supreme Lord. It has no independent authority. It 
works as the shadow moves, in accordance with the movements of the ob­
ject. But still material energy is very powerful, and the atheist, due to his 
godless temperament, cannot know how it works; nor can he know the plan 
of the Supreme Lord. Under illusion and the modes of passion and igno­
rance, all his plans are baffled, as in the case of HiraQ.yakasipu and RavaQ.a, 
whose plans were smashed to dust although they were both materially 
learned as scientists, philosophers, administrators and educators. These 
du§k[tinas, .or miscreants, are of four different patterns, as outlined below: 
(1) The miiphas are those who are grossly foolish, like hard-working 
beasts of burden. They want to enjoy the fruits of their labor by them­
selves, and so do not want to part with them for the Supreme. The typical 
example of the beast of burden is the ass. This humble beast is made to 
work very hard by his master. The ass does not really know for whom he 
works so hard day and night. He remains satisfied by filling his stomach 
with a bundle of grass, sleeping for a while under fear of being beaten by 
his master, and satisfying his sex appetite at the risk of being repeatedly 
kicked by the opposite party. The ass sings poetry and philosophy some­
times, but this braying only disturbs ot�ers. This is the position of the 
foolish fruitive worker who does not know for whom he should work. He 
does not know that karma (action) is meant for yajiia (sacrifice). 
Most often, those who work very hard day and night to clear the burden 
of self-created duties say that they have no time to hear of the immortality 
of the living being. To such miiphas, material gains, which are destructible, 
are life's all in all-despite the fact that the miiphas enjoy only a very small 
fraction of the fruit of labor. Sometimes they spend sleepless days and 
nights for fruitive gain, and although they may have ulcers or indigestion, 
they are satisfied with practically no food; they are simply absorbed in 
working hard day and night for the benefit of illusory masters. Ignorant of 
r
their real master, the foolish workers waste their .valuable time serving 
mammon. Unfortunately, they never surrender to the supreme master of 
all masters, nor do they take time to hear of Him from the proper sources. 
The swine who eat the soil do not care to· accept sweetmeats made of sugar 
and ghee. Similarly, the foolish worker will untiringly continue to hear of 
.·.··11

the sense-enjoyable tidings of the flickering mundane force that moves the 
material world .. 
(2) Another class of du§krtina, or miscreant, is called the nariidhama, or 
the lowest of mankind. Nara means human being, and adhama means the 
lowest. Out of the 8,400,000 different species of living beings, there are 
400,000 human species. Out of these there are numerous lower forms of 
human life that are mostly uncivilized. The civilized human beings are 
those who have regulated principles of social, political and religious life. 
Those who are socially and politically developed, but who have no religious 
principles, must be considered nariidhamas. Nor is religion without God 
religion, because the purpose of following religious principles is to know 
the Supreme Truth and man's relation with Him. In the Gitii the Person­
ality of Godhead clearly states that there is no authority above Him and 
that He is the Supreme Truth. The civilized form of human life is meant 
for man's reviving the· lost consciousness of his eternal relation with the 
Supreme Truth, the Personality of Godhead Sri Kr�IJ.a, who is all-powerful. 
Whoever loses this chance is classified as a nariidhama. We get information 
from revealed scriptures that when the baby is in the mother's womb (an 
extremely uncomfortable situation) he prays to God for deliverance and 
promises to worship Him alone as soon as he gets out. To pray to God 
when he is in difficulty is a natural instinct in every living being because he 
is eternally related with God. But after his deliverance, the child forgets 
the difficulties of birth and forgets his deliverer also, being influenced by 
miiyii, the illusory energy . 
. It is the duty of the guardians of children to revive the divine conscious­
ness dormant in them. The ten processes of reformatory ceremonies, as 
enjoined in the Manu-smrti, which is the guide to religious principles, are 
meant for reviving God consciousness in the system of varr-iisrama. How­
ever, no process is strictly followed now in any part of the world, and there­
fore 99.9 percent of the population is Tiariidhama. 
When the whole population becomes nariidhama, naturally all their so­
called education is made null and void by the all-powerful energy of physi­
cal nature. According to the standard of the Gitii, a learned man is he who 
sees on equal terms the learned briihmar-a, the dog, the cow, the elephant 
and the dog-eater. That is the vision of a true devotee. Sri Nityananda 
Prabhu, who is the incarnation of Godhead as divine master, delivered the 
typical nariidhamas, the brothers J agai and Madhai, and showed how the 
mercy of a real devotee is bestowed upon the lowest of mankind. So the 
nariidhama who is condemned by the Personality of Godhead can again 
revive his spiritual consciousness only by the mercy of a devotee. 
I 
Text 15) 
Knowledge of the Absolute 
385 
Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu, in propagating the bhiigavata-dharma or activi­
ties of the devotees, has recommended that people submissively hear the 
message of the Personality of Godhead. The essence of this message is 
Bhagavad-gitii. The lowest amongst human beings can be delivered by this 
submissive hearing process only, but unfortunately they even deny giving 
an aural reception to these messages, and what to speak of surrendering to 
the will of the Supreme Lord? Nariidhamas, or the lowest of mankind, will 
fully neglect the prime duty of the human being 
(3) The next class of du�krtina is called miiyayiipahrta-jniina, or those 
persons whose erudite knowledge has been nullified by the influence of 
illusory material energy. They are mostly very learned fellows-great phi­
losophers, poets, literati, scientists, etc.-but the illusory energy misguides 
them, and therefore they disobey the Supreme Lord. 
There are a great number of miiyayiipahrta-jniinas at the present moment, 
even amongst the scholars of the Gitii. In the Gitii, in plain and simple lan­
guage, it is stated that Sri Kr�va is the Supreme Personality of Godhead. 
There is none equal to or greater than Him. He is mentioned as the father 
of Brahma, the original father of all human beings. In fact, Sri Kr�va is said 
to be not only the father of Brahma but also the father of all species of life. 
He is the root of the impersonal Brahman and Paramatma; the Supersoul 
in every entity is His plenary portion. He is the fountainhead of everything, 
and everyone is advised to surrender unto His lotus feet. Despite all these 
clear statements, the miiyayiipahrta-jniina deride the Personality of the 
Supreme Lord and consider Him merely another human being. They do 
not know that the blessed form of human life is designed after the eternal 
and transcendental feature of the Supreme Lord. 
All the unauthorized interpretations of the Gitii by the class of 
mayayiipahrta-jiiiina, outside the purview of the paramparii system, are so 
many stumbling blocks in the path of spiritual understanding. The deluded 
interpreters do not surrender unto the lotus feet of Sri Kr�va, nor do 
they teach others to follow this principle. 
(4) The last class of du§krtina is called iisuram b(liivam iisrita, or those of 
demonic principles. This class is openly atheistic. Some of them argue that 
the Supreme Lord can never descend upon this material world, but they 
are unable to give any tangible reasons as to why not. There are others who 
make Him subordinate to the impersonal feature, although the opposite 
is declared in the Gitii. Envious of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, 
the atheist will present a number of illicit incarnations manufactured in the 
factory of his brain. Such persons whose very principle of life is to decry 
the Personality of Godhead cannot surrender unto the lotus feet of Sri 
Kr�l)a. 
386 
Bhagavad-gita As It Is 
[Ch. 7 
Sri Yamunacarya Alhandru of South India said, "0 my Lord! You are 
unknowable to persons involved with atheistic principles despite Your 
uncommon qualities, features, and activities and despite Your personality 
being confirmed by all the revealed scriptures in the quality of goodness, 
and despite Your being acknowledged by the famous authorities renowned 
for their depth of knowledge in the transcendental science and situated 
in the godly qualities." 
Therefore, (l) grossly foolish persons, (2) the lQwest of mankind, 
(3) the deluded speculators, and (4) the professed atheists, as above 
mentioned, never surrender unto the lotus feet of the Personality of 
Godhead in spite of all scriptural and authoritative advice.

0 best among the Bharatas [ Arjuna], four kinds of pious men render

Unlike the miscreants, these are adherents of the regulative principles 
of the scriptures, and they are called sukrtina, or those who obey the rules 
Text 16] 
Knowledge of the Absolute 
387 
and regulations of scriptures, the moral and social laws, and are, more or 
less, devoted to the Supreme Lord. Out of these there are four classes of 
men-those who are sometimes distressed, those who are in need of money, 
those who are sometimes inquisitive, and those who are sometimes search­
ing after knowledge of the Absolute Truth. These persons come to the 
Supreme Lord for devotional service under different conditions. These are 
not pure devotees because they have some aspiration to fulfill in exchange 
for devotional service. Pure devotional service is without aspiration and 
without desire for material profit. The Bhakti-rasiimrta-sindhu defines 
pure devotion thus: 
an yiib hilii§itiisiln yam jniina-k armiid y-aniivrtam 
iinukulyena krfpiinusilanam bhaktir uttamii. 
"One should render transcendental loving service to the Supreme Lord 
K.r�J;la favorably and without desire for material profit or gain through 
fruitive activities or philosophical speculation. That is called pure devo­
tional service." 
When these four kinds of persons come to the Supreme Lord for devo­
tional service and are completely purified by the association of a pure 
devotee, they also become pure devotees. As far as the miscreants are 
concerned, for them devotional service is very difficult because their lives 
are selfish, irregular and without spiritual goals .. But even some of them, by 
chance, when they come in contact with a pure devotee, also become pure 
devotees. 
Those who are always busy with fruitive activities come to the Lord in 
material distress and at that time associate with pure devotees and become, 
in their distress, devotees of the Lord. Those who are simply frustrated 
also come sometimes to associate with the pure devotees and become 
inquisitive to know about God. Similarly, when the dry philosophers are 
frustrated in every field of knowledge, they sometimes want to learn of 
God, and they come to the Supreme Lord to render devotional service and 
thus transcend knowledge of the impersonal Brahman and the localized 
Paramatma and come to the personal conception of Godhead by the grace 
of the Supreme Lord or His pure devotee. On the whole, when the dis­
tressed, the inquisitive, the seekers of knowledge, and those who are in 
need of money are free from all material desires, and when they fully 
understand that material remuneration has nothing to do with spiritual 
improvement, they become pure devotees. As long as such a purified stage 
is not attained, devotees in transcendental service to the Lord are tajnted 
388 
Bhagavad-glta As It Is 
[Ch. 7 
with fruitive activities, and they search after mundane knowledge, etc. 
So one has to transcend all this before one can come to the stage of pure 
devotional service.

Of these, the wise one who is in full knowledge in union with Me 
through pure devotional service is the best. For I am very dear to him, and 
he is dear to Me. 
PURPORT 
Free from all contaminations of material desires, the distressed, the 
inquisitive, the penniless, and the seeker after supreme knowledge can all 
become pure devotees. But out of them, he who is in knowledge of the 
Absolute Truth and free from all material desires becomes a really pure 
devotee of the Lord. And of the four orders, the devotee who is in full 
knowledge and is at the same time engaged in devotional service is, the 
Lord says, the best. By searching after knowledge one realizes that his self 
is different from his material body, and when further advanced he comes 
to the knowledge of impersonal Brahman and Paramatma. When one is 
fully purified, he realizes that his constitutional position is to be the 
eternal servant of God. So by association with pure devotees, the inquisi­
tive, th6 distressed, the seeker after material amelioration and the man in 
knowledge, aU become themselves pure. But in the preparatory stage, the 
Text 18)

man who is in full knowledge of the Supreme Lord and is at the same time 
executing devotional service is very dear to the Lord. He who is situated 
in pure knowledge of the transcendence of the Supreme Personality of 
God is so protected in devotional service that material contaminations can­
not touch him.

TRANSLATION 
All these devotees are undoubtedly magnanimous souls, but he who is 
situated in knowledge of Me I consider verily to dwell in Me. Being engaged 
in My transcendental service, he attains Me. 
PURPORT 
It is not that other devotees who are less complete in knowledge are not 
dear to the Lord. The Lord says that all are magnanimous because anyone 
who comes to the Lord for any purpose is called a mahiitmii or great soul. 
The devotees who want some benefit out of devotional service are accepted 
by the Lord because there is an exchange of affection. Out of affection 
they ask the Lord for some material benefit, and when they get it they 
become so satisfied that they also advance in devotional service. But the 
devotee in full knowledge is considered to be very dear to the Lord because 
390 
Bhagavad-glta As It Is 
[Ch. 7. 
his only purpose is to serve the Supreme Lord with love and devotion. 
Such a devotee cannot live a second without contacting or serving the 
Supreme Lord. Similarly, the Supreme Lord is very fond of His devotee 
and cannot be separated from him. 
In the Srimad-Bhiigavatam (9.4.57), the Lord says: 
aham bhakta-pariidhino hy asvatantra iva dvija 
siidhubhir grasta-hrdayo bhaktair bhakta-jana"priya� 
"The devotees are always in My heart, and I am always in the heart of the 
devotees. The devotee does not know anything beyond Me, and I also 
cannot forget the devotee. There is a very intimate relationship between 
Me and the pure devotees. Pure devotees in full knowledge are never out of 
spiritual touch, and therefore they are very much dear to Me.""

tion, while one is trying to give up one's attachment to materialism, there 
is some leaning towards impersonalism, but when one is further advanced 
he can understand that there are activities in the spiritual life and that these 
activities constitute devotional service. Realizing this, he becomes attached 
to the Supreme Personality of Godhead and surrenders to Him. At such a 
time one can understand that Lord Sri Kr��a 's mercy is everything, that He 
is the cause of all causes and that this material manifestation is not inde­
pendent from Him. He realizes the material world to be a perverted reflec­
tion of spiritual variegatedness and realizes that in everything there is a 
relationship with the Supreme Lord Kr��a. Thus he thinks of everything 
in relation to Vasudeva, or Sri Kr��a. Such a universal vision of Vasudeva 
precipitates one's full surrender to the Supreme Lord Sri Kr��a as the 
highest goal. Such surrendered_ great souls are very rare. 
This verse is very nicely explained in the Third Chapter of Svetiisvatara 
Upan�ad: "In this body there are powers of speaking, of seeing, of hearing, 
of mental activities, etc. But these are not important if not related to the 
Supreme Lord. And because Vasudeva is all-pervading and everything is 
Vasudeva, the devotee surrenders in full knowledge." (Cf. Bhagavad-gitii 
7.17 and 11.40)

Bhagavad-glta As It Is 
(Ch. 7 
PURPORT 
Those who are freed from all material contaminations surrender unto 
the Supreme Lord and engage in His devotional service. As long as the 
material contamination is not completely washed off, they are by nature 
nondevotees. But even those who have material desires and who resort to 
the Supreme Lord are not so much attracted by external nature; because of 
approaching the right goal, they soon become free from all material lust. 
In the Srimad-Bhiigavatam it is recommended that whether one is free 
from all material desires, or is full of material desires, or desires liberation 
from material contamination, or is a pure devotee and has no desire for 
material sense gratification, he should in all cases surrender to Vasudeva 
and worship Him. 
It is said in the Bhiigavatam that less intelligent people who have lost 
their spiritual sense take shelter of demigods for immediate fulfillment of 
material desires. Generally, such people do not go to the Supreme Person­
ality of Godhead, because they are in particular modes of nature (ignorance 
and passion) and therefore worship various demigods. Following the rules 
and regulations of worship, they are satisfied. The worshipers of demigods 
are motivated by small desires and do not know how to reach the 
supreme goal, but a devotee of the Supreme Lord is not misguided. Be­
cause in Vedic literature there are recommendations for worshiping dif­
ferent gods for different purposes (e.g., a diseased man is recommended 
to worship the sun), those who are not devotees of the Lord think that for 
certain purposes demigods are better than the Supreme Lord. But a pure 
devotee knows that the Supreme Lord Kr�pa is the master of all. In the 
Caitanya-caritiimrta it is said that only the Supreme Personality of God­
head, Kr�pa, is master and all others are servants. Therefore a pure devotee 
never goes to demigods for satisfaction of his material needs. He depends 
on the Supreme Lord. And the pure devotee is satisfied with whatever He 
gives.

I am in everyone's heart as the Supersoul. As soon as one desires to

self to some particular deity. 
PURPORT 
God has given independence to everyone; therefore, if a person desires 
to have material enjoyment and wants very sincerely to have such facilities 
from the material demigods, the Supreme Lord, as Supersoul in everyone's 
heart, understands and gives facilities to such persons. As the supreme 
father of all living entities, He does not interfere with their independence, 
but gives all facilities so that they can fulfill their material desires. Some 
may ask why the all-powerful God gives facilities to the living entities for 
enjoying this material world and so lets them fall into the trap of the 
illusory energy. The answer is that if the Supreme Lord as Supersoul does 
not give such facilities, then there is no meaning to independence. There­
fore He gives everyone full independence-whatever one likes-but His 
ultimate instruction we find jn the Bhagavad-gitii: man should give up all 
other engagements and fully surrender unto Him. That will make man 
happy. 
·Both the living entity and the demigods are subordinate to the will of 
the Supreme Personality of Godhead; therefore the living entity cannot 
worship the demigod by his own desire, nor can the demigod bestow any 
benediction without the supreme will. As it is said, not a blade of grass 
moves without the will of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Generally, 
persons who are distressed in the material world go to the demigods, as 
they are advised in the Vedic literature. A person wanting some particular 
thing may worship such and such a demigod. For example, a diseased 
person is recommended to worship the sun-god; a person wanting educa­
tion may worship the goddess of learning, Sarasvati; and a person wanting 
a beautiful wife may worship the goddess Uma, the wife of Lord Siva. In 
this way there are recommendations in the siistras (Vedic scriptures) for 
different modes of worship of different demigods. And because a particular 
394 
Bhagavad-gita As It Is 
[Ch. 7 
living entity wants to enjoy a particular material facility, the Lord inspires 
him with a strong desire to achieve that benediction from that particular 
demigod, and so he successfully receives the benediction. The particular 
mode of the devotional attitude of the living ent:ty toward a particular 
type of demigod is also arranged by the Supremt Lord. The demigods 
cannot infuse the living entities with such an affimty, but because He is 
the Supreme Lord or the Supersoul who is present in the heart of all living 
entities, Kr�Q.a gives impetus to man to worship certain demigods. The 
demigods are actually different parts of the universal body of the Supreme 
Lord; therefore they have no independence. In the Vedic literature 
(Taittiriya Upani§ad, First Anuvaka) it is stated: "The Supreme Personality 
of Godhead as Supersoul is also present within the heart of the demigod; 
therefore He arranges through the demigod to fulfill the desire of the 
living entity. But both the demigod and the living entity are dependent on 
the supreme will. They are not independent."

Endowed with such a faith, he seeks favors of a particular demigod and

PURPORT 
The demigods cannot award benediction to the devotees without the 
permission of the Supreme Lord. T}:te living entity may forget that every· 
thing is the property of the Supreme Lord, but the demigods do not for­
get. So the worship of demigods and achievement of' desired results are not

due to the demigods but to the Supreme Personality of Godhead, by 
arrangement. The less intelligent living entity does not know this, and 
therefore he foolishly goes to the demigods for some benefit. But the 
pure devotee, when in need of something, prays only to the Supreme 
Lord. Asking for material benefit, however, is not a sign of a pure devotee. 
A living entity goes to the demigods usually because he is mad to fulfill his 
lust. This happens when something undue is desired by the living entity, 
and the Lord Himself does not fulfill the desire. In the Caitanya-caritiimrta 
it is said that one who worships the Supreme Lord and at the same time 
desires material enjoyment is contradictory in his desires. Devotional ser­
vice of the Supreme Lord and the worship of a demigod cannot be on the 
same platform because worship of a demigod is material and devotional 
service to the Supreme Lord is completely spiritual. 
For the living entity who desires to return to Godhead, material desires 
are impediments. A pure devotee of the Lord is therefore not awarded the 
material benefits desired by less intelligent living entities who prefer to 
worship demigods of the material world rather than engage in devotional 
service of the Supreme Lord.

Men of small intelligence worship the demigods, and their fruits are

396 
Bhagavad-glta As It Is 
[Ch. 7. 
PURPORT 
Some commentators on the Gitii say that one who worships a demigod 
can reach the Supreme Lord, but here it is clearly stated that the worshipers 
of demigods go to the different planetary systems where various demigods 
are situated, just as a worshiper of the sun achieves the sun or a worshiper 
of the demigod of the moon achieves the moon. Similarly, if anyone wants 
to worship a demigod like lndra, he can attain that particular god's planet. 
It is not that everyone, regardless of whatever demigod is worshiped, will 
reach the Supreme Personality of Godhead. That is denied here, for it is 
clearly stated that the worshipers of demigods go to different planets in 
the material world, but the devotee of the Supreme Lord goes directly to 
the supreme planet of the Personality of Godhead. 
Here the point may be raised that if the demigods are different parts of 
the body of the Supreme Lord, then the same end should be achieved by 
worshiping them. However, worshipers of the demigods are less intelligent 
because they don't know to what part of the body food must be supplied. 
Some of them are so foolish that they claim that there are many parts and 
many ways to supply food. This isn't very sanguine. Can anyone supply 
food to the body through the ears or eyes? They do not know that these 
demigods are different parts of the universal body of the Supreme Lord, 
and in their ignorance they believe that each and every demigod is a sepa­
rate God and a competitor of the Supreme Lord. 
Not only are demigods parts of the Supreme Lord, but ordinary living 
entities are also. In the Srimad-Bhiigavatam it is stated that the briihmap,as 
are the head of the Supreme Lord, thek�atriyas are the arms, etc., and that 
all serve different functions. Regardless of the situation, if one knows that 
both the demigods and himself are part and parcel of the Supreme Lord, 
his knowledge is perfect. But if he does not understand this, he achieves 
different planets where the demigods reside. This is not the same destina­
tion the devotee reaches. 
The results achieved by the demigods' benedictions are perishable 
because within this material world the planets, the demigods and their 
worshipers are all perishable. Therefore it is clearly stated in this verse that 
all results achieved by worshiping demigods are perishable, and therefore 
such worship is performed by the less intelligent living entity. Because the 
pure devotee engaged in Kr�!la consciousness in devotional service of the 
Supreme Lord achieves eternal blissful existence that is full of knowledge, 
his achievements and those of the common worshiper of the demigods are 
different. The Supreme Lord is unlimited; His favor is unlimited; His mercy 
Text 24]

is unlimited. Therefore the mercy of the Supreme Lord upon His pure 
devotees is unlimited.

TRANSLATION 
Unintelligent men, who know Me not, think that I have assumed this 
form and personality. Due to their small knowledge, they do not know My 
higher nature, which is changeless and supreme. 
PURPORT 
Those who are worshipers of demigods have been described as less intel­
ligent persons, and here the impersonalists are similarly described. Lord 
'• 
Kr��a in His personal form is here speaking before Arjuna, and still, due to 
ignorance, impersonalists argue that the Supreme Lord ultimately has no 
form. Yamunadi.rya, a great devotee of the Lord in the disciplic succession 
from Ramanujacarya, has written two very appropriate verses in this con­
nection. He says, "My dear Lord, devotees like Vyasadeva and Narada 
know You to be the Personality of Godhead. By understanding different 
Vedic literatures, one can come to know Your characteristics, Your form 
and Your activities, and one can thus understand that You are the Supreme 
Personality of Godhead. But those who are in the modes of passion and 
ignorance, the demons, the nondevotees, cannot understand You. They 
398 
Bhagavad-glta As It Is 
[Ch. 7 
are unable to understand You. However expert such nondevotees may be 
in discussing Vedanta and the Upaniljads and other Vedic literatures, it is 
not possible for them to understand the Personality of Godhead." 
In the Brahma-sarhhita it is stated that the Personality of Godhead 
cannot be understood simply by study of the Vedanta literature. Only by 
the mercy of the Supreme Lord can the Personality of the Supreme be 
known. Therefore in this verse it is clearly stated that not only the wor­
shipers of the demigods are less intelligent, but those nondevotees who are 
engaged in Vedanta and speculation on Vedic literature without any tinge 
of true Kr�9a consciousness are also less intelligent, and for them it is not 
possible to understand God's personal nature. Persons who are under the 
impression that the Absolute Truth is impersonal are described as asuras, 
which means one who does not know the ultimate feature of the Absolute 
Truth. In the Srimad-Bhiigavatam it is stated that supreme realization 
begins from the impersonal Brahman and then rises to the localized Super­
soul-but the ultimate word in the Absolute Truth is the Personality of 
Godhead. Modern impersonalists are still less intelligent, for they do not 
even follow their great predecessor, Sankaracarya, who has specifically 
stated that Kr�9a is the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Impersonalists, 
therefore, not knowing the Supreme Truth, think Kr�9a to be only the son 
of Devaki' and Vasudeva, or a prince, or a powerful living entity. This is also 
condemned in Bhagavad-gita: "Only the fools regard Me as an ordinary 
person." The fact is that no one can understand Kr�pa without rendering 
devotional service and without developing Kr�f.la consciousness. The Gita 
confirms this. 
One cannot understand the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Kr�f.la, or 
His form, quality or name simply by mental speculation or by discussing 
Vedic literature. One must understand Him by devotional service. When 
one is fully engaged in Kr�9a consciousness, beginning by chanting the 
mahamantra-Hare K�9a, Hare Kr�f.la, Kr�9a Kr�f.la, Hare Hare/Hare Rama, 
Hare Rama, Rama Rama, Hare Hare-then only can one understand the 
Supreme Personality of Godhead. Nondevotee impersonalists think that 
Kr�9a has a body made of this material nature and that all His activities, 
His form and everything, are mayii. These impersonalists are known as 
Mayavad1. They do not know the ultimate truth. 
The twentieth verse clearly states: "Those who are blinded by lusty 
desires surrender unto the different demigods." It is accepted that besides 
the Supreme Personality of Godhead, there are demigods who have their 
different planets (Bg. 7.23 ), and the Lord also has a planet. It is also stated 
Text 25] 
Knowl�dge of the Absolute 
399 
that the worshipers of the demigods go to the different planets of the demi­
gods, and those who are devotees of Lord Kr�tla go to the Kr�tlaloka 
planet. Although this is clearly stated, the foolish impersonalists still main­
tain that the Lord is formless and that these forms are impositions. From 
the study of the Gitii does it appear that the demigods and their abodes 
are impersonal? Clearly, neither the demigods nor Kr�p.a, the Supreme 
Personality of Godhead, are impersonal. They are all persons; Lord Kr�tla 
is the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and He has His own planet, and 
the demigods have theirs. 
Therefore the monistic contention that ultimate truth is formless and 
that form is imposed does not hold true. It is clearly stated here that it is 
not imposed. From the Gitii we can clearly understand that the forms of 
the demigods and the form of the Supreme Lord are simultaneously exist­
ing and that Lord Kr�p.a is sac-cid-iinanda, eternal blissful knowledge. The 
Vedas also confirm that the Supreme Absolute Truth is iinandamaya, or 
full of blissful pleasure, and that He is abhyiisiit, by nature the reservoir of 
unlimited auspicious qualities. And in the Gitii the Lord says that although 
He is aja (unborn), He still appears. These are the facts that we should 
understand from the Gitii. We cannot understand how the Supreme Person­
ality of Godhead can be impersonal; the imposition theory of the imper­
sonalist monist is false as far as the statements of the Gitii are concerned. 
It is clear herein that the Supreme Absolute Truth, Lord Kr�J;la, has both 
form and personality.

TRANSLATION 
I am never manifest to the foolish and unintelligent. For them I am 
covered by My eternal creative potency [yoga-maya]; and so the deluded 
world knows Me not, who am unborn and infallible. 
PURPORT 
It may be argued that since Kr�J;la was present on this earth and was 
visible to everyone, then why isn't He manifest to everyone now? But 
actually He was not manifest to everyone. When Kr�J;la was present there 
were only a few people who could understand Him to be the Supreme 
Personality of Godhead. In the assembly of Kurus, when SiSupala spoke 
against Kr�J;la being elected president of the assembly, Bhi�ma supported 
Him and proclaimed Him to be the Supreme God. Similarly, the Pap.�avas 
and a few others knew that He was the Supreme, but not everyone. He 
was not revealed to the nondevotees and the common man. Therefore 
in the Gitii Kr�J;la says that but for His pure devotees, all men consider 
Him to be like themselves. He was manifest only to His devotees as the 
reservoir of all pleasure. But to others, to unintelligent nondevotees, He 
was covered by His eternal potency. 
In the prayers of Kunti in the Srimad-Bhiigavatam (1.8.18), it is said 
that the Lord is covered by the curtain of yoga-miiyii and thus ordinary 
people cannot understand Him. Kunti prays: "0 my Lord, You are the 
maintainer of the entire universe, and devotional service to You is the 
highest religious principle. Therefore, I pray that You will also maintain 
me. Your transcendental form is covered by the yoga-miiyii. The brahma­
jyoti is the covering of the internal potency. May You kindly remove this 
glowing effulgence that impedes my seeing Your sac-cid-iinanda-vigraha, 
Your eternal form of bliss and knowledge." 
This yoga-miiyii curtain is also mentioned in the Fifteenth Chapter of 
the Gitii. The Supreme Personality of Godhead in His transcendental form 
of bliss and knowledge is covered by the eternal potency of brahmajyoti, 
and the less intelligent impersonalists cannot see the Supreme on this 
account. Also in the S rimad-Bhiigavatam ( 10 .14. 7) there is this prayer by 
Brahma: "0 Supreme Personality of Godhead, 0 Supersoul, 0 master of all 
mystery, who can calculate Your potency and pastimes in this world? 
You are always expanding Your eternal potency, and therefore no one can 
understand You. Learned scientists and learned scholars can examine the 
atomic constitution of the material world or even the planets, but still

they are unable to calculate Your energy and potency, although You are 
present before them." The Supreme Personality of Godhead, Lord Kr�pa, 
is not only unborn, but He is avyaya, inexhaustible. His eternal form is bliss 
and knowledge, and His energies are all inexhaustible.

PURPORT 
Here the question of personality and impersonality is clearly stated. 
If Kr�pa, the form of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, is considered 
by the impersonalists to be miiyii, to be material, then He would, like the 
living entity, change His body and forget everything in His past life. 
Anyone with a material body cannot remember his past life, nor can he 
foretell his future life, nor can he predict the outcome of his present life; 
therefore he cannot know what is happening in past, present and future. 
Unless one is lfberated from material contamination, he cannot know 
past, present and future. 
Unlike the ordinary human being, Lord Kr�pa clearly says that He 
402 
Bhagavad -gita As It Is 
[Ch. 7. 
completely knows what happened in the past, what is happening in the 
present, and what will happen in the future. In the Fourth Chapter we 
have seen that Lord Kr�Q.a remembers instructing Vivasvan, the sun-god, 
millions of years ago. Kr�Q.a knows every living entity because He is 
situated in every living being's heart as the Supreme Soul. But despite 
His presence in every living entity as Supersoul and His presence beyond 
the material sky, as the Supreme Personality of Godhead, the less intel­
ligent cannot realize Him as the Supreme Person. Certainly the transcen­
dental body of Sri Kr�Q.a is not perishable. He is just like the sun, and 
miiyii. is like the cloud. In the material world we can see that there is the 
sun and that there are clouds and different stars and planets. The clouds 
may cover all these in the sky temporarily, but this covering is only 
apparent to our limited vision. The sun, moon and stars are not actually 
covered. Similarly, mii.yii. cannot cover the Supreme Lord. By His internal 
potency He is not manifest to the less intelligent class of men. As it is 
stated in the third verse of this chapter, out of millions and millions of 
men, some try to become perfect in this human form of life, and out of 
thousands and thousands of such perfected men, hardly one can under­
stand what Lord Kr�Q.a is. Even if one is perfected by realization of 
impersonal Brahman or localized Paramatma, he cannot possibly under­
stand the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Sri K�Q.a, without being in 
Kr�Q.a consciousness.

TRANSLATION 
0 scion of Bharata [ Arjuna], 0 conquerer of the foe, all living entities 
are hom into delusion, overcome by the dualities of desire and hate. 
PURPORT 
The real constitutional position of the living entity is that of subordina­
tion to the Supreme Lord, who is pure knowledge. When one is deluded 
into separation from this pure knowledge, he becomes controlled by 
illusory energy and cannot understand the Supreme Personality of Godhead. 
The illusory energy is manifested in the duality of desire and hate. Due to 
desire and hate, the ignorant person wants to become one with the 
Supreme Lord and envies Kr�r;ta as the Supreme Personality of Godhead. 
Pure devotees, who are not so deluded or contaminated by desire and 
hate, can understand 
that 
Lord Sri Kr�r;ta appears by His internal 
potencies, but those who are deluded by duality and nescience think that 
the Supreme Personality of Godhead is created by material energies. This 
is their misfortune. Such deluded persons, symptomatically, ·dwell in 
dualities of dishonor and honor, misery and happiness, woman and man, 
good and bad, pleasure and pain, etc., thinking, "This is .my wife; this is 
my house; I am the master of this house; I am the husband of this wife." 
These are the dualities of delusion. Those who are so deluded by dualities 
are completely foolish and therefore cannot understand the Supreme 
Personality of Godhead.

TRANSLATION 
Persons who have acted piously in previous liv�s and in this life, whose 
sinful actions are completely eradicated and who are freed from the 
duality of delusion, engage themselves in My service with determination. 
PURPORT 
Those eligible for elevation to the transcendental position are mentioned 
in this verse. For those who are sinful, atheistic, foolish and deceitful, it is 
very difficult to transcend the duality of desire and hate. Only those who 
have passed their lives in practicing the regulative principles of religion, 
who have acted piously and 'have conquered sinful reactions can accept 
devotional 
service and gradually rise to the pure knowledge of the 
Supreme Personality of Godhead. Then, gradually, they can meditate in 
trance on the Supreme Personality of Godhead. That is the process of 
being situated on the spiritual platform. This elevation is possible in Kr�pa 
consciousness in the association of pure devotees who can deliver one from 
delusion. 
It is stated in the Srimad-Bhiigavatam that if one actually wants to be 
liberated he must render service to the devotees; but one who associates 
with materialistic people is on the path leading to the darkest region of 
existence. All the devotees of the Lord traverse this earth just to recover 
the conditioned souls from their delusion. The impersonalists do not know 
that forgetting their constitutional position as subordinate to the Supreme 
Lord is the greatest violation of God's law. Unless one is reinstated in his 
own constitutional position, it is not possible to understand the Supreme 
Personality or to be fully engaged in His transcendental loving service with 
determination.

TRANSLATION 
Intelligent persons who are endeavoring for liberation from old age and 
death take refuge in Me in devotional service. They are actually Brahman 
because they entirely know everything about transcendental and fruitive 
activities. 
PURPORT 
Birth, death, old age and diseases affect this material body, but not the 
spiritual body. There is no birth, death, old age and disease for the 
spiritual body, so one who attains a spiritual body, becomes one of the 
associates of the Supreme Personality of Godhead and engages in eternal 
devotional service, is really liberated. Aham brahmasmi: I am spirit. It is 
said that one should understand that he is Brahman-spirit soul. This 
Brahman conception of life is also in devotional service, as described in this 
verse. The pure devotees are transcendentally situated on the Brahman 
platform, and they know everything about transcendental and material 
activities. 
Four kinds of impure devotees who engage themselves in the transcen­
dental service of the Lord achieve their respective goals, and by the grace 
of the Supreme Lord, when they are fully Kr�tta conscious, they actually 
enjoy spiritual association with the Supreme Lord. But those who are 
worshipers of demigods never reach the Supreme Lord in His supreme 
planet. Even the less intelligent Brahman-realized persons cannot reach the 
supreme planet of Kr�tta known as Goloka Vrndavana. Only persons who 
perform activities in Kn;Q.a consciousness (miim asritya) are actually 
entitled to be called Brahman, because they are actually endeavoring to 
reach the Kr�tta planet. Such persons have no misgivings about Kr�pa , and 
thJJS they are factually Brahman. 
Those who are engaged in worshiping the form or area of the Lord or 
who are engaged in meditation on the Lord simply for liberation from 
material bondage, also know, by the grace of the Lord, the purports of 
Brahman, adhibhiita, etc., as explained by the Lord in the next chapter.

Those who know Me as the Supreme Lord, as the governing principle of 
the material manifestation, who know Me as the one underlying all the 
demigods and as the one sustaining all sacrifices, can, with steadfast mind, 
understand and know Me even at the time of death. 
PURPORT 
I 
Persons acting in Kr�J;J.a consciousness are never entirely deviated from 
the path of understanding the Supreme Personality of Godhead. In the 
transcendental association of Kr�J;J.a consciousness, one can understand 
how the Supreme Lord is the governing principle of the material manifes­
tation and even of the demigods. Gradually, by such transcendental asso­
ciation, one becomes convinced of the Supreme Personality of Godhead 
Himself, and at the time of death such a Kr�J;J.a conscious person can never 
forget Kr�J;J.a. Naturally he is thus promoted to the planet of the Supreme 
Lord, Goloka Vrndavana . 
. This Seventh Chapter particularly explains how one can become a fully 
Kr�tla conscious person. The beginning of Kr�tla consciousness is associa­
tion of persons who are Kr�tla conscious. Such association is spiritual and 
puts one directly in touch with the Supreme Lord, and, by His grace, one 
can understand Kr�J;J.a to be the Supreme God. At the same time one can 
Text 30] 
Knowledge of the Absolute 
407 
really understand the constitutional position of the living entity and how 
the living entity forgets Kr�va and becomes entangled in material activi­
ties. By gradual development of Kr�va consciousness in good association, 
the living entity can understand that due to forgetfulness of Kr�va he has 
become conditioned by the laws of material nature. He can also under­
stand that this human form of life is an opportunity to regain Kr�va 
consciousness and that it should be fully utilized to attain the causeless 
mercy of the Supreme Lord. 
Many subjects have been discussed in this chapter: the man in distress, 
the inquisitive man, the man in want of material necessities, knowledge of 
Brahman, knowledge of Paramatma, liberation from birth, death and 
diseases, and worship 'Of the Supreme Lord. However, he who is actually 
elevated in Kr�va consciousness does not care for the different processes. 
He simply directly engages himself in activities of Kr�va consciousness and 
thereby factually attains his constitutional position as eternal servitor of 
Lord Kr�pa. In such a situation he takes pleasure in hearing and glorifying 
the Supreme Lord in pure devotional service. He is convinced that by 
doing so, all his objectives will be fulfilled. This determined faith is called 
dnlha-vrata, and it is the beginning of bhakti-yoga or transcendental loving 
service. That is the verdict of all scriptures. This Seventh Chapter of the 
Gitii is the substance of that conviction. 
Thus end the Bhaktivedanta Purports to the Seventh Chapter of the 
Srimad-Bhagavad-gita in the matter of Knowledge of the Absolute.

TRANSLATION 
Arjuna inquired: 0 my Lord, 0 Supreme Person, what is Brahman? 
What is the self? What are fruitive activities? What is this material mani­
festation? And what are the demigods? Please explain this to me. 
PURPORT 
In this chapter Lord Krwa answers these different questions of Aijuna 
beginning with, "What is Brahman?"The Lord also explains karma, fruitive 
activities, devotional service and yoga principles, and devotional service in 
its pure form. The Srimad-Bhagavatam explains that the Supreme Absolute 
Truth is known as Brahman, Paramatma, and Bhagavan. In addition, the 
living entity, individual soul, is also called Brahman. Arjuna also inquires 
about iitmii, which refers to body, soul and mind. According to the Vedic 
dictionary, iitmii refers to the mind, soul, body and senses also. 
Arjuna has addressed the Supreme 
Lord as Puru§ottama, Supreme 
Person, which means that he was putting these questions not simply to a 
friend but to the Supreme Person, knowing Him to be the supreme authori­
ty able to give definitive answers.

Text 3 J 
Attaining the Supreme 
4ll 
PURPORT 
The Lord of sacrifice accepts lndra and Vigm. Vi�pu is the chief of the 
primal demigods, including Brahma and Siva, and Indra is the chief of the 
administrative demigods. Both lndra and Vi�J)U are worshiped by yajiia 
performances. But here Arjuna asks who is actually the Lord of yajiia 
(sacrifice), and how is the Lord residing within the body of the living 
entity. 
Arjuna addresses the Lord as Madhusiidana because K.r�pa once killed a 
demon named Madhu. Actually these questions, which are of the nature of 
doubts, should not have arisen in the mind of Arjuna because Arjuna is a 
Kr�v.a conscious devotee. Thereiore these doubts are like demons. Since 
Kr�pa is so expert in killing demons, Arjuna here addresses Him as Madhu­
siidana so that Kr�pa might kill the demonic doubts that arise in Arjuna's 
mind. 
-
Now the word prayiir;w-kiile in this verse is very significant because 
whatever we do in life will be tested at the time of death. Arjuna fears 
that at the time of death, those who are in Kr�pa consciousness will forget 
the Supreme Lord because at such a time body functions are disrupted 
and the mind may be in 
a panic-stricken state. Therefore Maharaja 
Kulasekhara, a great devotee, prays, "My dear Lord, may I die immediate­
ly now that I'm healthy so that the swan of my mind may enter into the 
stem of Thy lotus feet." This metaphor is used because the swan often 
takes pleasure if! entering the stem of the lotus flower-similarly, the mind 
of the pure devotee is drawn to the lotus feet. of the Lord. Maharaja 
Kulasekhara fears that at the moment of death his throat will be so 
choked up that he will not be able to chant the holy names, so it is better 
to "die immediately." Arjuna questions how one's mind can remain fixed· 
on Kr�v.a 's lotus feet at such times.

TRANSLATION 
The Supreme Lord said, The indestructible, transcendental living entity 
is called Brahman, and his eternal nature is called the self. Action pertaining 
to the development of these material bodies is called karma, or fruitive 
activities. 
PURPORT 
Brahman is indestructible and eternally existing, and its constitution is 
not changed at any time. But beyond Brahman there is Parabrahman. 
Brahman refers to the living entity, and Parabrahman refers to the Supreme 
Personalitf of Godhead. The constitutional ,position of the living entity is 
different from the position he takes in the material world. In material con­
sciousness, his nature is to try to be the lord of matter, but in spiritual 
(Kr��a) consciousness, his position is to serve the Supreme. When the living 
entity is in material consciousness, he has to take on various bodies in the 
material world. That is called karma, or varied creation by the force of 
material consciousness. 
In Vedic literature the living entity is called jiviitmii and Brahman, but 
he is never called Parabrahman. The living entity (jiviitmii) takes different 
positions-sometimes he merges into the dark material nature and identifies 
himself with matter, and sometimes he identifies himself with the superior 
spiritual nature. Therefore he is called the Supreme Lord's marginal energy. 
According to his identification with material or spiritual nature, he receives 
a material or spiritual body. In material nature he may take a body from 
any of the 8,400,000 species of life, but in spiritual nature he has only one 
body. In material nature he is sometimes manifested as a man, demigod, an 
animal, a beast, bird, etc., according to his karma. To attain material 
Text 4] 
Attaining the Supreme 
413 
heavenly planets and enjoy their facilities, he sometimes performs sacri­
fices (yajna), but when his merit is exhausted, he returns to earth again in 
the form of a man. 
In the process of sacrifice, the living entity makes specific sacrifices to 
attain specific heavenly planets and consequently reaches them. When the 
merit of sacrifice is exhausted, then the'living entity descends to earth in 
the form of rain, then takes on the form of grains, and the grains are eaten 
by man and transformed into semen, which impregnates a woman, and 
thus the living entity once again attains the human form to perform sacri­
fice and so repeat the same cycle. In this way, the living entity perpetually 
comes and goes on the material path. The Kr�!!a conscious person, however, 
avoids such sacrifices. He takes directly to Kr�!la consciousness and thereby 
prepares himself to return to Godhead. 
Impersonalist commentators on the Gitii unreasonably assume that 
Brahman takes the form of jiva in the material world, and to substantiate 
this they refer to Chapter Fifteen, verse 7, of the Gitii. But this verse also 
speaks of the living entity as "an eternal fragment of Myself." The frag­
ment of God, the living entity, may fall down into the material world, but 
the Supreme Lord (Acyuta) never falls down. Therefore this assumption 
that the Supreme Brahman assumes the form of jiva is not acceptable. It is 
important to remember that in Vedic literature Brahman (the living entity) 
is distinguished from Parabrahman (the Supreme Lord).

[Ch. 8 
TRANSLATION 
Physical nature is known to be endlessly mutable. The universe is the 
cosmic form of the Supreme Lord, and I am that Lord represented as the 
Supersoul, dwelling in the heart of every embodied being. 
PURPORT 
The physical nature is constantly changing. Material bodies generally 
pass t�rough six stages: they are born, they grow, they remain for some 
duration, they produce some by-products, they dwindle, and then they 
vanish. This physical nature is called adhibhutam. Because it is created at a 
certai!l point and will be annihilated at a certain point, the conception of 
the universal form of the Supreme Lord that includes all the demigods and 
their different planets is called adhidaivatam. The individual soul (jiva) 
accompanies the body. The Supersoul, a plenary representation of Lord 
Kr�l).a, is called the Paramatma or adhiyajna and is situated in the heart. 
The word eva is particularly important in the context of this verse because 
by this word the Lord stresses that the Paramatma is not different from 
Him. The Supersoul, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, seated beside 
the individual soul, is the witness of the individual soul's activities and is 
the source of consciousness. The Supersoul gives the jiva an opportunity to 
act freely, and He witnesses his activities. The functions of all these differ­
ent manifestations of the Supreme Lord automatically become clarified 
for the fnlJ;e Kr�tla conscious devotee engaged in transcendental service of 
the Lord. The gigantic universal form of the Lord called adhidaivatam is 
contemplated by the neophyte who cannot approach the Supreme Lord in 
His manifestation as Supersoul. The neophyte is advised to contemplate 
the universal form whose legs are considered the lower planets and whose 
eyes are considered the son and moon, and whose head is considered the 
upper planetary system.

PURPORT 
In this verse the importance of Krwa consciousness is stressed. Anyone 
who quits his body in Kr�tla consciousness is at once transferred to the 
transcendental abode of the Supreme Lord. The word smaran (remember­
ing) is important. Remembrance of Kr�tla is not possible for the impure 
soul who has not practiced Kr�tla consciousness in devotional service. To 
remember Kr�tla one should chant the mahiimantra, Hare Kr�tla, Hare 
Kr�tla, Kr�tla Kr�tla, Hare Hare/ Hare Ram a, Hare Rama, Rama Rama, Hare 
Hare, incessantly, following in the footsteps of Lord Caitanya, being more 
tolerant than the tree, humbler than the grass and offering all respect to 
others without requiring respect in return. In such a way one will be able 
to depart from the body successfully remembering Kr�tla and so attain the 
supreme goal.

TRANSLATION 
Whatever st�te of being one remembers when he quits his body, that 
state he will attain without fail. 
PURPORT 
The process of changing one's nature at the critical moment of death is 
here explained. How can one die in the proper state of mind? Maharaja 
Bharata thought of a deer at the time of death and so was transferred to 
that form of life. However, as a deer, Maharaja Bharata could remember 
his past activities. Of course the cumulative effect of the thoughts and 
actions of one's life influences one's thoughts at the moment of death; 
therefore the actions of this life determine one's future state of being. If 
one is transcendentally absorbed in Kr�l).a's service, then his next body will 
he tra�scendental (spiritual), not physical. Therefore the chanting of Hare 
Kr�l).a is the best process for successfully changing one's state of being to 
transcendental life.

This instruction to Arjuna is very important for all men engaged in 
material activities. The Lord does not say that one should give up his 
prescribed duties or engagements. One can continue them and at the same 
time think of Kr��a by chanting Hare Kr��a. This will free one from 
material contamination and engage the mind and intelligence in Kr��a. By 
chanting Kr��a's names, one will be transferred to the supreme planet, 
Kr��aloka, without a doubt.

PURPORT 
In this verse Lord Kr��a stresses the importance of remembering Him. 
One's memory of Kr��a is revived by chanting the mahamantra, Hare 
Kr��a. By this practice of chanting and hearing the sound vibration of the 
Supreme Lord, one's ear, tongue and mind are engaged. This mystic medi­
tation is very easy to practice, and it helps one attain the Supreme 
Lord. Puru§am means enjoyer. Although living entities belong to the

marginal energy of the Supreme Lord, they are in material contamination. 
They think themselves enjoyers, but they are not the supreme enjoyer. 
Here it is clearly stated that the supreme enjoyer is the Supreme Person­
ality of Godhead in His different manifestations and plenary expansions as 
Niiriiya!la, Vasudeva, etc. 
The devotees can constantly think of the object of worship, the Supreme 
Lord, in any of His features, Niiriiya!\a, Kr�!la, Riima, etc., by chanting 
Hare Kr�!la. This practice will purify him, and at the end of his life, due to 
his constant chanting, he will be transferred to the kingdom of God. Yoga 
practice is meditation on the Super soul within; similarly, by chanting 
Hare Kr�!la one fixes his mind always on the Supreme Lord. The mind is 
fickle, and therefore it is necessary to engage the mind by force to think of 
Krwa. One example often given is that of the caterpillar that thinks of 
becoming a butterfly and so is transformed into a butterfly in the same 
life. Similarly, if we constantly think of Kr�!la, it i.s certain that at the end 
of our lives we shall have the same bodily constitution as Kr�!la.

Attaining the Supreme 
419 
TRANSLATION 
One should meditate upon the Supreme Person as the one who knows 
everything, as He who is the oldest, who is the controller, who is smaller 
than the smallest, who is the maintainer of everything, who is beyond all 
material conception, who is inconceivable, and who is always a person. He 
is luminous like the sun and, being transcendental, is beyond this material 
nature. 
PURPORT 
The process of thinking of the Supreme is mentioned in this verse. The 
foremost point is that He is not impersonal or void. One cannot meditate 
on something impersonal or void. That is very difficult. The process of 
thinking of Kr��a, however, is very easy and is factually stated herein. 
First of all, He is puru§a, spiritual, Rama and Kr��a, and is described herein 
as kavim; that is, He knows past, present and future and therefore knows 
everything. He is the oldest personality because He is the origin of every­
thing; everything is horn out of Him. He is also the supreme controller of 
the universe, maintainer and instructor of humanity. He is smaller than the 
smallest. The living entity is one lO,OOOth part of the tip of a hair, hut the 
Lord is so inconceivably small that He enters into the heart of this particle. 
Therefore He is called smaller than the smallest. As the Supreme, He can 
enter into the atom and into the heart of the smallest and control him as 
the Supersoul. Although so small, He is still all-pervading and is maintain­
ing everything. By Him all these planetary systems are sustained. We often 
wonder how these big planets are floating in the air.lt is stated here that 
the Supreme Lord, by His inconceivable energy, is sustaining all these big 
planets and systems of galaxies. The word acintya (inconceivable) is very 
significant in this connection. God's energy is beyond our conception, 
beyond our thinking jurisdiction, and is therefore called inconceivable 
(acintya). Who can argue this point? He pervades this material world and 
yet is beyond it. We cannot even comprehend this material world, which is 
insignificant compared to the spiritual world-so how can we comprehend 
what is beyond? Acintya means that which is beyond this material world, 
that which our argument, logic and philosophical speculation cannot touch, 
that which is inconceivable. Therefore intelligent persons, avoiding useless 
argument and speculation, should accept what is stated in scriptures like 
the Vedas, Gitii, and Srimad-Bhiigavatam and follow the principles they set 
down. This will lead one to understanding ..

TRANSLATION 
One who, at the time of death, fixes his life air between the eyebrows 
and in full devotion engages himself in remembering the Supreme Lord, 
will certainly attain to the Supreme Personality of Godhead. 
PURPORT 
In this verse it is clearly stated that at the time of death the mind must 
be fixed in devotion on the Supreme Godhead. For those practiced in 
yoga, it is recommended that they raise the life force between the eye­
brows, but for a pure devotee who does not practice such yoga, the mind 
should always be engaged in Krg•a consciousness so that at death he can 
remember the Supreme by His grace. This is explained in verse fourteen. 
The particular use of the word yoga-balena is significant in this verse 
because without practice of yoga one cannot come to this transcendental 
state of being at the time of death. One cannot suddenly remember the 
Supreme Lord at death unless he is practiced in some yoga system, espe­
cially the system of bhakti-yoga. Since one's mind at death is very dis­
turbed, one should practice transcendence through yoga during one's life.

TRANSLATION 
Persons learned in the Vedas, who utter omkara and who are great 
sages in the renounced order, enter into Brahman. Desiring such perfec-. 
tion, one practices celibacy. I shall now explain to you this process by 
which one may attain salvation. 
PURPORT 
Lord Kr��a explains that Brahman, although one without a second, has 
different manifestations and features. For the impersonalists, the syllable 
om is identical with Brahman. Kr��a here explains the impersonal Brahman 
in which the renounced order of sages enter. 
In the Vedic system of knowledge, students, from the very beginning, 
are taught to vibrate om and learn of the ultimate impersonal Brahman by 
living with the spiritual master in cqmplete celibacy. In this way they 
realize two of Brahman's features. This practice is very essential for the 
student's advancement in spiritual life, but at the moment such brahmaciiri 
(unmarried celibate) life is not at all possible. The social construction of 
the world has changed so much that there is no possibility of one's 
practicing celibacy from the beginning of student life. Throughout the 
world there are many institutions for different departments of knowledge, 
422 
Bhagavad-glta As It Is 
[Ch. 8 
but there is no recognized institution where students can be educated in 
the brahmaciiri principles. Unless one practices celibacy, advancement in 
spiritual life is very difficult. Therefore Lord Caitanya has announced, 
according to the scriptural injunctions for this age of Kali, that no process 
of realizing the Supreme is possible except the chanting of the holy name 
of Lord Kr��a: Hare Kr��a, Hare Kr�pa, Kr�pa Kr�pa, Hare Hare/ Hare 
Rama, Hare Rama, Rama Rama, Hare Hare.

TRANSLATION 
The yogic situation is that of detachment from all sensual engagements. 
Closing all the doors ofthe senses and fixing the mind on the heart and 
the life air at the top of the head, one establishes himself in yoga. 
PURPORT 
To practice yoga, as suggested here, one first has to close the door of all 
sense enjoyment. This practice ,is called pratyahiira, or withdrawing the 
senses from the sense objects. Sense organs for acquiring knowledge, such 
as the eyes, ears, nose, tongue and touch, should be fully controlled and 
should not be allowed to engage in self-gratification. In this way the mind 
focuses on the Supersoul in the heart and the life force is raised to the top 
of the head. In the Sixth Chapter this process is described in detail. But as 
mentioned before, this practice is not practical in this age. The best 
process is K�pa consciousness. lf one is always able to fix his mind on

It is clearly stated here that om, Brahman, and Lord Kr�tta are not 
different. The impersonal sound of Kr�l).a is om, but the sound Hare 
Kr�tta contains om. It is clearly recommended in this age that if one 
quits his body at the end of this life chanting the mahiimantra, Hare 
Kr�tJ.a, he will reach the spiritual planets. Similarly, those who are devotees 
of Kr�tta enter the K�tta planet or Goloka V rndavana, whereas the 
impersonalists remain in the btahmajyoti. The personalists also enter 
many innumerable planets in the spiritual sky known as V aikuttthas.

TRANSLATION 
For one who remembers Me without deviation, I am easy to obtain, 0 
son of Prtha, because of his constant engagement in devotional service. 
PURPORT 
In this verse the bhakti-yoga of the unalloyed devotees of the Supreme 
Godhead is described. The preceeding verses mention four different kinds 
of devotees-the distressed, the inquisitive, those who seek material gain, 
and the speculative philosophers. Different processes of liberation from 
material entanglement have also been described: karma-yoga, jiiiina-yoga, 
and hatha-yoga. But here bhakti-yoga, without any mixture of these, is 
mentioned. In bhakti-yoga the devotees desire nothing but Krwa. The 
pure bhakti devotee does not desire promotion to heavenly planets, nor 
does he seek salvati9n or liberation from material entanglement. A pure 
devotee does not desire anything. In the Caitanya-caritiimrta the pure 
devotee is called ni§kiima, which means he has no desire for self-interest. 
Perfect peace belongs to him alone, not to them who strive for personal 
gain. The pure devotee only wants to please the Supreme Lord, and so the 
Lord says that for anyone wh9 is unflinchingly devoted to Him, He is easy 
to attain. The devotee can render service to any of the transcendental forms 
of the Supreme Lord, and he meets with none of the problems that 
plague the practitioners of other yogas. Bhakti-yoga is very simple and 
pure and easy to perform. One can begin by simply chanting Hare Krwa. 
Kf�p.a is very merciful to those who engage in His service, and He helps in 
various ways that devotee who is fully surrendered to Him so he can 
understand Him as He is. The Lord gives such a devotee sufficient intel­
ligence so that ultimately the devotee can attain Him in His spiritual 
kingdom. 
Text 15] 
Attaining the Supreme 
425 
The special qualification of the pure devotee is that he is always thinking 
of Kr�pa without considering the time or place. There should be no 
impediments. He should be able to carry out his service anywhere and at 
any time. Some say that the devotee should remain in holy places like 
V rndavana or some holy town where the Lord lived, but a pure devotee 
can live anywhere and create the atmosphere of V rndavana by his devo· 
tional service. It was Sri Advaita who told Lord Caitanya, "Wherever You 
are, 0 Lord-there is Vrndavana." 
A pure devotee constantly remembers Kr�pa and meditates upon Him. 
These are qualifications of the pure devotee for whom the Lord is most 
easily attainable. Bhakti-yoga is the system that the Gitii recommends 
above all others. Generally, the bhakti-yogis are engaged in five different 
ways: l) siinta-bhakta, engaged in devotional service in neutrality; 2) 
diisya-bhakta, engaged in devotional service as servant; 3) siikhya-bhakta, 
engaged as friend; 4) viitsalya-bhakta, engaged as parent; and 5) miidhurya­
bhakta, engaged as conjugal lover of the Supreme Lord. In any of these 
ways, the pure devotee is always constantly engaged in the transcendental 
loving service of the Supreme Lord and cannot forget the Supreme Lord, 
and so for him the Lord is easily attained. A pure devotee cannot forget 
the Supreme Lord for a moment, and similarly, the Supreme Lord cannot 
forget His pure devotee for a moment. This is the great blessing of the 
.Kf�p.a conscious process of chanting the mahiimantra, Hare Kr�pa.

TRANSLATION 
After attaining Me, the great souls, who are yogis in devotion, never 
return to this temporary world, which is full of miseries, because they 
have attained the highest perfection. 
PURPORT 
Since this temporary material world is full of the miseries of birth, old 
age, disease and death, naturally he who achieves the highest perfection 
and attains the supreme planet, Kr��Jaloka, Goloka Vrndavana, does not 
wish to return. The supreme planet is described in Vedic literature as 
beyond our material vision, and it is considered the highest goal. The 
mahiitmiis (great souls) receiv� transcendental messages from the realized 1 
devotees and thus gradually develop devotional service in Kr�!la conscious­
ness and become so absorbed in transcendental service that they no longer 
desire elevation to any of the material planets, nor do they even want to be 
transferred to any spiritual planet. They only want Kr�!la's association and 
nothing else. Such great souls in Kr�!la consciousness attain the highest 
perfection of life. In other words, they are the supreme souls.

But one who attains to My abode, 0 son of Kunti, never takes birth

PURPORT 
All kinds of yogis-karma, jniina, hatha, etc.-eventually have to attain 
devotional perfection in bhakti-yoga, or Kr�l)a consciousness, before they 
can go to Kr�l)a 's transcendental abode and never return. Those who attain 
the highest material planets or the planets of the demigods are again sub­
jected to repeated birth and death. As persons- on earth are elevated to 
higher planets, people in higher planets such as Brahmaloka, Candraloka 
and lndraloka fall down to earth. The practice of sacrifice called panciigni­
vidyii, recommended in the Katha Upan�ad, enables one to achieve 
Brahmaloka, but if, in Brahmaloka, one does not cultivate Kr�l)a conscious- ' 
ness, then he must return to earth. Those who progress in Kr�IJ.a con­
sciousness in the higher planets are gradually elevated to higher and higher 
planets and at the time of universal devastation are transferred to the 
eternal spiritual kingdom. When there is devastation of this material 
universe, Brahma and his devotees, who are constantly engaged in Kr�l)a 
consciousness, are all transferred to the spiritual universe and to specific 
spiritual planets according to their desires.

428 
Bhagavad-gita As It Is 
[Ch. 8 
PURPORT 
The duration of the material universe is limited. It is manifested in cycles 
of kalpas. A kalpa is a day of Brahma, and one day of Brahma consists of 
a thousand cycles of four yugas or ages: Satya, Treta, Dvapara, and Kali. 
The cycle of Satya is characterized by virtue, wisdom and religion, there 
being practically no ignorance and vice, and the yuga lasts 1,728,000 
years. In the Treta-yuga vice is introduced, and this yuga lasts 1,296,000 
years. In the Dvapara-yuga there is an even greater decline in virtue and 
religion, vice increasing, and this yuga lasts 864,000 years. And finally in 
Kali-yuga (the yuga we have now been experiencing over the past 5,000 
years) there is an abundance of strife, ignorance, irreligion and vice, true 
virtue being practically nonexistent, and this yuga lasts 432,000 years. In 
' 
Kali-yuga vice increases to such a point that at the termination of the 
yuga the Supreme Lord Himself appears as the Kalki avatiira, vanquishes 
the demons, saves His devotees, and commences another Satya-yuga. 
Then the process is set rolling again. These four yugas, rotating a thousand 
times, comprise one day of Brahma, the creator god, and the same number 
comprise one night. Brahma lives one hundred of such "years" and then 
dies. These "hundred years" by earth calculations total to 311 trillion and 
40 million earth years. By these calculations the life of Brahma seems 
fantastic and interminable, but from the viewpoint of eternity it is as brief 
·as a lightning flash. In the causal ocean there are innumerable Brahmas 
rising and disappearing like bubbles in the Atlantic. Brahma and his crea­
tion are all part of the material universe, and therefore they are in constant 
flux. 
In the material universe not even. Brahma is free from the process of 
birth, old age, disease and death. Brahma, however, is directly engaged in 
th,e service of the Supreme Lord in the management of this universe­
therefore he at once attains liberation. Elevated sannyiisis are promoted 
to Brahma 's particular planet, Brahmaloka, which is the highest planet in 
the material universe and which survives all the heavenly planets in the 
upper strata of the planetary system, but in due course Brahma and all 
inhabitants of Brahmaloka are subject to death, according to the law of 
material nature.

TltANSLATION 
When Brahma's day is manifest, this multitude of living entities comes 
into being, and at the arrival of Brahma's night they are all annihilated. 
PURPORT 
The less intelligent jivas try to remain within this material world and are 
accordingly elevated and degraded in the various p1anetary systems. During 
the day time of Brahma they exhibit their activities, and at the coming of 
Brahma's night they are annihilated. In the day they receive various bodies 
for material activities, and at night these bodies perish. The jivas (individual 
souls) remain compact in the body of Vi�pu and again and again are mani­
fest at the arrival of Brahma's day. When Brahma's life is finally finished, 
they are all annihilated and remain unmanifest for millions and millions 
of years. Finally, when Brahma is born again in another millennium, they 
are again manifest. In this way the jivas are captivated by the material 
world. However, those intelligent beings who take to Kr�pa consciousness 
and chant Hare Kr�r;�.a, Hare Rama in devotional service transfer themselves, 
even in this life, to the spiritual planet of Kr�pa and become eternally bliss­
ful there, not being subject to such rebirths.

annihilated. When all in this world is annihilated, that part remains as it is. 
PURPORT 
Kr�pa's superior spiritual energy is transcendental and eternal. It is 
beyond all the changes of material nature, which is manifest and anni­
hilated during the days and nights of Brahma. K�pa's superior energy 
is 
completely opposite in quality to material nature. Superior and 
inferior nature are explained in the Seventh Chapter.

TRANSLATION 
That supreme abode is called unmanifested and infallible, and it is the 
supreme destination. When one goes there, he never comes back. That is 
My supreme abode. 
PURPORT 
The supreme abode of the Personality of Godhead, Kr�v.a, is described 
in the Brahma-sarhhitii as cintiimari-dhiima, a place where all desires are 
fulfilled. The supreme abode of Lord Kr�va known as Goloka Vrndavana 
is full of palaces made of touchstone. There are also trees which are called 
"desire trees" that supply any type of eatable upon demand, and there 
are cows known as surabhi cows which supply a limitless supply of milk. 
In this abode, the Lord is served by hundreds of thousands of goddesses 
of fortune (Lak�mis), and He is called Govinda, the primal Lord and the 
cause of all causes. The Lord is accustomed to blow His flute (venum 
kvanantam). His transcendental form is the most attractive in all the 
worlds-His eyes are like the lotus petals and the color of His body like 
clouds. He is so attractive that His beauty excels that of thousands of 
cupids. He wears saffron cloth, a garland around His neck and a peacock 
feather in His hair. In the Gitii Lord Kr�va gives only a small hint of His 
personal abode (Goloka Vrndavana) which is the supermost planet in the 
spiritual kingdom. A vivid description is given in the Brahma-sarhhitii. 
Vedic literature states that there is nothing superior to the abode of the 
Supreme Godhead, and that that abode is the ultimate destination. When 
- j
I 
432 
Bhagavad-glta As It Is 
[Ch. 8 
one attains to it, he never returns to the material world. Kr�t!a's supreme 
abode and Kr�tla Himself are nondifferent, being of the same quality. On 
this earth, Vrndavana, ninety miles southeast of Delhi, is a replica of that 
supreme Goloka Vrndavana located in the spiritual sky. When Kr�tla 
descended on this earth, He sported on that particular tract of land known 
as Vrndavana in the district of Mathura, India.

The Supreme Personality of Godhead, who is greater than all, is attain­
able by unalloyed devotion. Although He is present in His abode, He is 
all-pervading, and everything is situated within Him. 
PURPORT 
It is here clearly stated that the supreme destination from which there 
is no return is the abode of Kr�t\a, the Supreme Person. The Brahma­
samhitii describes this supreme abode as iinanda-cinmaya-rasa, a place 
where everything is full of spiritual bliss. Whatever variegatedness is 
manifest there is all of the quality of spiritual bliss-there is nothing 
material. All variegatedness is expanded as the spiritual expansion of 
the Supreme Godhead Himself, for the manifestation there is totally 
· 
of the spiritual energy, as explained in Chapter Seven. As far as this 
Text 23] 
Attaining the Supreme 
433 
material world is concerned, althou gh the Lord is always in His supreme 
abode, He is n'onetheless all-pervading by His material energy. So by 
His spiritual and material energies He is present everywhere-both in 
the material and in the spiritual universes. Yasyiinta�sthiini means that 
everything is sustained by Him, whether it be spiritual or material energy. 
It is clearly stated here that only by bhakti, or devotional service, can 
one enter into the V aikurttha (spiritual) planetary system. In all the 
V aikurtthas there is only one Supreme Godhead, Kr�rta, who has expanded 
Himself into millions and millions of plenary expansions. These plenary 
expansions are four-armed, and they preside over the innumerable spiritual 
planets. They are known by a variety of names-Puru�ottama, Trivikrama, 
Kesava, Madhava, Aniruddha, Hr�ikesa, Sankar�arta, Pradyumna, Sridhara, 
Vasudeva, Damodara, Janardana, Narayarta, Vamana, Padmanabha, etc. 
T:hese plenary expansions are likened unto the leaves of a tree, and the 
main tree is likened to Kr��a. K��a, dwelling in Goloka V rndavana, His 
supreme abode, systematically conducts all affairs of both universes 
(material and spiritual) without a flaw by power of His all-peryasiveness.

Bhagavad-gita As It Is 
[Ch. 8 
PURPORT 
The unalloyed devotees of the Supreme Lord who are totally surrendered 
souls do not care when they leave their bodies or by what method. They 
leave everything in Kr�va's hands and so easily and happily return to 
Godhead. But those who are not unalloyed devotees and who depend 
instead on such methods of spiritual realization as karma-yoga, jiiiina-yoga, 
hatha-yoga, etc., must leave the body at a suitable time and thereby be 
assured whether or not they will return to the world of birth and death. 
If the yogi is perfect, he can select the time and place for leaving this 
material world, but if he is not so perfect, then he has to leave at nature's 
will. The most suitable time to leave the body and not return is being 
explained by the Lord in these verses. According to Acarya Baladeva 
Vidyabhu�al)a, the Sanskrit word kiila used herein refers to the presiding 
deity of time.

Attaining the Supreme 
435 
PURPORT 
When fire, light, day and moon are mentioned, it is to be understood 
that over all of them there are various presiding deities who make 
arrangements for the passage of the soul. At the time of death, the jiva sets 
forth on the path to a new life. If one leaves the body at the time 
designated above, either accidently or by arrangement, it is possible for 
him to attain the impersonal brahmajyoti. Mystics who are advanced in 
yoga practice can arrange the time and place to leave the body. Others 
have no control-if by accident they leave at an auspicious moment, then 
they will not return to the cycle of birth and death, but if not, then there 
is every possibility that they will have to return. However, for the pure 
devotee in Kr�!la consciousness, there is no fear of returning, whether he 
leaves the body at an auspicious or inauspicious moment, by accident or 
arrangement.

attain to the moon at death. These elevated souls live on the moon for 
about 10,000 years (by demigod calculations) and enjoy life by drinking 
soma-rasa. They eventually return to earth. This means that on the moon 
there are higher classes of living beings, though they may not be perceived 
by the gross senses.

The same description of departure and return is quoted by Acarya 
Baladeva Vidyabhii�apa from the Chandogya Upani§ad. In such a way, 
those who are fruitive laborers and philosophical speculators from time 
immemorial are constantly going and coming. Actually they do not attain 
ultimate salvation, for they do not surrender to Kr�I].a.

PURPORT 
Kr�!la is here advising Arjuna that he should not be disturbed by. the 
different paths the soul can take when leaving the material world. A 
devotee of the Supreme Lord should not worry whether he will depart 
either by arrangement or by accident. The devotee should be firmly 
established in Kr�!la consCiousness and chant Hare Kr�!J.a. He should 
know that concern over either of these two paths is troublesome. The 
best way to be absorbed in Kr�!la consciousness is to be always dovetailed 
in His service, and this will make one's path to the spiritual kingdom safe, 
certain, and direct. The word yoga-yukta is especially significant in this 
verse. One who is firm �n yoga is constantly engaged in Kr�!la consciousness 
in all his activities. Sri Riipa Gosvami advises that one should be un­
attached in. the material world and that all affairs should be steeped in 
Kr�!la consciousness. In this way one attains perfection. Therefore the 
devotee is not disturbed by these descriptions becatise he knows that 
his passage to the supreme abode is guaranteed by devotional service.

TRANSLATION 
A person who accepts the path of devotional service is not bereft of the 
results derived from studying the Vedas, performing austere sacrifices, 
giving charity or pursuing philosophical and fruitive activities. At the end 
he reaches the supreme abode. 
PURPORT 
This verse is the summation of the Seventh and Eighth Chapters, 
particularly as the chapters deal with Kf�J)a consciousness and devotional 
service. One has to study the Vedas under the guidance of the spiritual 
master and undergo many austerities and penances while living under his 
care. A brahmaciiri has to live in the home of the spiritual master just like 
a servant, and he must beg alms from door to door and bring them to the 
spiritual master. He takes food only under the master's order, and if the 
master neglects to call the student for food that day, the student fasts. 
These are some of the Vedic principles for observing brahmacarya. 
After the student studies the Vedas under the master for a period from 
five to twenty years, he may become a man of perfect character. Study 
of the Vedas is not meant for the recreation of armchair speculators, but 
for the formation of character. After this training, the brahmaciiri is allowed 
to enter into household life and marry. When he is a householder, he also 
has to perform many sacrifices and strive for further enlightenment. 
Then after retiring from household life, upon accepting the order of 
viinaprastha, he undergoes severe penances, such as living in forests, 
dressing with tree bark, not shaving, etc. By carrying out the orders of 
brahmacliri, householder, viinaprastha and finally sannyiisa, one becomes 
Text 28] 
Attaining the Supreme 
439. 
elevated to the perfectional stage of life. Some are then elevated to the 
heavenly kingdoms, and when they become even more advanced they are 
liberated in the spiritual sky, either in the impersonal b rahmajyo ti or in 
the Vaikuvtha planets or Krwaloka. This is the path outlined by Vedic 
literatures. 
The beauty of Kr�va consciousness, however, is that by one stroke, by 
engaging in devotional service, one can surpass all rituals of the different 
orders of life. 
One should try to understand the Seventh and Eighth Chapters of the 
Gitii not by scholarship or mental speculation, but by hearing them in 
association with pure devotees. Chapters Six through Twelve are 1, the 
essence of the Gitii. If one is fortunate to understand the Gita-especially 
these middle six chapters-in the association of devotees, then his life at 
once becomes glorified beyond all penances, sacrifices, charities, specula­
tions, etc. One should hear the Gitii from the devotee because at the 
beginning of the Fourth Chapter it is stated that the Gitii can only be 
perfectly understood by devotees. Hearing the Gitii from devotees, not 
from mental speculators, is called faith. Through association of devotees, 
one is placed in devotional service, and by this service Kr�va 's activities, 
form, pastimes, name, etc., become clear, and all misgivings are dispelled. 
Then once doubts are removed, the study of the Gitii becomes extremely 
pleasurable, and one develops a taste and feeling for Kr�va consciousness. 
In the advanced stage, one falls completely in love with Kr�!J.a, and that is 
the beginning of the highest perfectional stage of life which prepares the 
devotee's transferral to Kr�!la's abode in the spiritual sky, Goloka 
Vrndavana, where the devotee enters into eternal happiness. 
Thus end the Bhaktivedanta Purports to the Eighth Chapter of the 
Srimad-Bhagavad-gita in the matter of Attaining the Supreme.

TRANSLATION 
The Supreme Lord said: My dear Arjuna, because you are never envious 
of Me, I shall impart to you this most secret wisdom, knowing which you 
shall he relieved of the miseries of material existence. 
PURPORT 
As a devotee hears more and more about the Supreme Lord, he he­
comes enlightened. This hearing process is recommended in the Srimad­
Bhiigavatam: "The messages of the Supreme Personality of Godhead are 
full of potencies, and these potencies can he realized if topics regarding 
the Supreme Godhead are discussed amongst devotees. This cannot he 
achieved by the association of mental speculators or academic scholars, for 
it is realized knowledge." 
. 
The devotees are constantly engaged in the Supreme Lord's service. The 
Lord understands the mentality and sincerity of a particular living entity 
who is engaged in Kr�J;la consciousness and gives him the intelligence to 
understand the science of Kr�J;la in the association of the devotees. Dis­
cussion of Kr�J;la is very potent, and if a fortunate person has such associa­
tion and tries to assimilate the knowledge, then he will surely make 
advancement toward spiritual realization. Lord Kr�l)a, in order to en­
courage Arjuna to higher and higher elevation in His potent service, de­
scribes in this Ninth Chapter matters more confidential than any He has 
already disclosed. 
The very beginning of Bhagavad-gitii, the First Chapter, is more or less 
an introduction to the rest of the book; and in the Second and Third 
Chapters, the spiritual knowledge described is called confidential. Topics 
discussed in the Seventh and Eighth Chapters are specifically related to 
devotional service, and because they bring enlightenment in Kr�J;la con­
sciousness, they are called more confidential. But the matters which are 
described in the Ninth Chapter deal with unalloyed, pure devotion. There­
fore this is called the most confidentiaL One who is situated in the most 
confidential knowledge of Kr�J;la is naturally transcendental; he therefore 
has no material pangs, although he is in the material world. In the Bhakti­
rasiimrta-sindhu it is said that although one who has a sincere desire to 
render loving service to the Supreme Lord is situated in the conditional 
state of material existence, he is to be considered liberated. Similarly, we 
shall find in the Bhagavad-gitii, Tenth Chapter, that anyone who is engaged 
in that way is a liberated person. 
Text 2) 
The Most Confidential Knowledge 
443 
Now this first verse has specific significance. Knowledge (idam jiiiinam) 
refers to pure devotional service, which consists of nine different activities: 
hearing, chanting, remembering, serving, worshiping, praying, obeying, 
maintaining friendship and surrendering everything. By the practice of 
these nine elements of devotional service one is elevated to spiritual con­
sciousness, Kr�pa consciousness. At the time when one's heart is cleared of 
the material contamination, one can understand this science of Kr�pa. 
Simply to understand that a living entity is not material is not sufficient. 
That may be the beginning of spiritual realization, but one should recognize 
the difference between activities of the body and spiritual activities by 
which one understands that he is not the body. 
In the Seventh Chapter we have already discussed the opulent potency 
of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, His different energies, the inferior 
and superior natures, and all this material manifestation. Now in Chapters 
Nine and Ten the glories of the Lord will be delineated. 
The Sanskrit word anasuyave in this verse is also very significant. 
Generally the commentators, even if they are highly scholarly, are all 
envious of Kr�v.a, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Even the most 
erudite scholars write on Bhagavad-gitii very inaccurately. Because they are 
envious of Kr�v.a, their commentaries are useless. The commentaries given 
by devotees of the Lord are bona fide. No one can explain Bhagavad-gitii, 
or give perfect knowledge of Kr�pa if he is envious. One who criticizes the 
character of Kr�v.a without knowing Him is a fool. So such commentaries 
should be very carefully avoided. For one who understands that Kr�v.a is 
the Supreme Personality of Godhead, the pure and transcendental Person­
ality, these chapters will be very beneficial.

TRANSLATION 
This knowledge is the king of education, the most secret of all secrets. It 
is the purest knowledge, and because it gives direct perception of the self 
by realization, it is the perfection of religion. It is everlasting, and it is 
joyfully performed. 
PURPORT 
This chapter of Bhagavad-gitii is called the king of education because it 
is the essence of all doctrines and philosophies explained before. There are 
seven principal philosophers in India: Gautama, KaJ)iida, Kapila, Yajiia­
valkya, SiiJ)c;lilya, V aisviinara, and, finally, Vyasadeva, the author of the 
Vediinta-sutra. So there is no dearth of knowledge in the field of philosophy 
or transcendental knowledge. Now the Lord says that this Ninth Chapter is 
the king of all such knowledge, the essence of all knowledge that can be 
derived from the study of the Vedas and different kinds of philosophy. It 
is the most confidential because confidential or transcendental knowledge 
involves understanding the difference between the soul and the body. And 
the king of all confidential knowledge culminates in devotional service. 
Generally, people are not educated in this confidential knowledge; they 
are educated in external knowledge. As far as ordinary education is con­
cerned, people are involved with so many departments: politics, sociology, 
physics, chemistry, mathematics, astronomy, engineering, etc. There are so 
many departments of knowledge all over the world and many huge univer­
sities, but there is, unfortunately, no university or educational institution 
where the science of the spirit soul is instructed. Yet the soul is the most 
important part of this body; without the presence of the soul, the body 
has no value. Still people are placing great stress on the bodily necessities 
of life, not caring for the vital soul. 
The Bhagavad-gitii, especially from the Second Chapter on, stresses the 
importance of the soul. In the very beginning, the Lord says that this body 
is perishable and that the soul is not perishable. That is a confidential part 
of knowledge: simply knowing that spirit soul is different from this body 
and that its nature is immutable, indestructible and eternal. But that gives 
no positive information about the soul. Sometimes people are under the 
Text 2) 
The Most Confidential Knowledge 
445 
impression that the soul is different from the body and that when the body 
is finished, or one is liberated from the body, the soul remains in a void 
and becomes impersonal.- But actually that is not the fact. How can the 
soul, which is so active within this body, be inactive after being liberated 
from the body? It is always active. If it is eternal, then it is eternally active, 
and its activities in the spiritual kingdom are the most confidential part of 
spiritual knowledge. These activities of the spirit soul are therefore indi­
cated here as constituting the king of all knowledge, the most confidential 
part of all knowledge. 
This knowledge is the purest form of all activities, as is explained in 
Vedic literature. In the Padma Purorw, man's sinful activities have been 
analyzed and are shown to be the results of sin after sin. Those who are 
engaged in fruitive activities are entangled in different stages and forms of 
sinful reactions. For instance, when the seed of a particular tree is sown, 
the tree does not appear immediately to grow; it takes some time. lt is 
first a small, sprouting plant, then it assumes the form of a tree, then it 
flowers, bears fruit, and, when it is complete, the flowers and fruits are 
enjoyed by persons who have sown the seed of the tree. Similarly, a man 
performs a sinful act, and like a seed it takes time to fructify. There are 
different stages. The sinful action may have already stopped within the 
individual, but the results or the fruit of that sinful action are still enjoyed. 
There are sins which are still in the form of a seed, and there are others 
which are already fructified and are giving us fruit, which we are enjoying 
as distress and pain, as explained in the twentieth verse of the Seventh 
Chapter. 
A person who has completely ended the reactions of all sinful activities 
and who is fully engaged in pious activities, being freed from the duality 
of this material world, becomes engaged in devotional service to the 
Supreme Personality of Godhead, Kr�pa. In other words, those who are 
actually engaged in the devotional service of the Supreme Lord are already 
freed from all reactions. For those who are engaged in the devotional ser­
vice of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, all sinful reactions, whether 
fructified, in the stock, or in the form of a seed, gradually vanish. There­
fore the purifying potency of devotional service is very strong, and it is 
called pavitram uttamam, the purest. Uttamam means transcendental. 
Tamas means this material world or darkness, and uttamam means that 
which is transcendental to material activities. Devotional activities are 
never to be considered material, although sometimes it appears that devo­
tees are engaged just like ordinary men. One who can see and is familiar 
with devotional service, however, will know that they are not material 
'

Bhagavad-glta As It Is 
[Ch. 9 
· 
activities. They are all spiritual and devotional, uncontaminated by the 
material modes of nature. 
It is said that the execution of devotional service is so perfect that one 
can perceive the results directly. This direct result is actually perceived, 
and we have practical experience that any person who is chanting the 
holy names of Kr�pa (Hare Kr�pa, Hare Kr�pa, Kr�pa Kr�pa, Hare Hare/ 
Hare Riima, Hare Riima, Riima Riima, Hare Hare) in course of time feels 
some transcendental pleasure and very quickly becomes purified of all 
material contamination. This is actually seen. Furthermore, if one engages 
not only in hearing but in trying to broadcast the message of devotional 
activities as well, or if he engages himself in helping the missionary activi­
ties of Kr�pa consciousness, he gradually feels spiritual progress. This 
advancement in spiritual life does not depend on any kind of previous 
education or qualification. The method itself is so pure that by simply 
engaging in it one becomes pure. 
In the Vedii.nta-siltra this is also described in the following words: 
prakii.sas ca karmar-y abhyii.sii.t. "Devotional service is so potent that simply 
by engaging in the activities of devotional service, one becomes enlightened 
without a doubt." Narada, who happened to be the son of a maidservant, 
had no education, nor was he born into a high family. But when his mother 
was engaged in serving great devotees, Narada also became engaged, and 
sometimes, in the absence of his mother, he would serve the great devotees 
himself. Narada personally says, "Once only, by their permission, I took 
the remnants of their food, and by so doing all my sins were at once 
eradicated. Thus being engaged, I became purified in heart, and at that time 
the very nature of the transcendentalist became attractive to me." (Bhiig. 
1.5.25) Narada tells· his disciple Vyasadeva that in a previous life he was 
engaged as a boy servant of purified devotees during four months of their 
stay and that he was intimately associating with them. Sometimes those 
sages left remnants of food on their dishes, and the boy, who would wash 
their dishes, wanted to taste the remnants. So he asked the great devotees 
whether he could eat them, and they gave their permission. Narada then 
ate those remnants and consequently became freed from all sinful reactions. 
· As he went on eating, he gradually became as purehearted as the sages, and 
he gradually developed the same taste. The great devotees relished the 
taste of unceasing devotional service of the Lord, hearing, chanting, etc., 
and by developing the same taste, Narada wanted also to hear and chant 
the glories of the Lord. Thus by associating with the sages, he developed a 
great desire for devotional service. Therefore he quotes from the Vediinta­
siltra (prakii.sas ca karmar-y abhyii.sii.t): If one is engaged simply in the acts 
Text 2) 
The Most Confidential Knowledge 
447 
of devotional service, everything is revealed to him automatically, and he 
can understand. This is called prakasa�, directly perceived. 
Narada was actually a son of a maidservant. He had no opportunity to 
go to school. He was simply assisting his mother, and fortunately his 
mother rendered some service to the devotees. The child Narada also got 
the opportunity and simply by association achieved the highest goal of all 
religions, devotional service. In the Srimad-Bhiigavatam it is said that 
religious people generally do not know that the highest perfection of reli­
gion is the attainment of the stage of devotional service. Generally Vedic 
knowledge is required for the understanding of the path of self-realization. 
But here, although he was not educated in the Vedic principle, Narada 
acquired the highest results of Vedic study. This process is so potent that 
even without performing the religious process regularly, one can be 
raised to the highest perfection. How is this possible? This is also confirmed 
in Vedic literature: aciiryaviin puru�o veda. One who is in association with 
great iicaryas, even if he is not educated or has not studied the Vedas, can 
become familiar with all the knowledge necessary for realization. 
The process of devotional service is a very happy one. Why? Devotional 
service consists of sravarwrh kirtanam vircw�, so one can simply hear the 
chanting of the glories of the Lord or can attend philosophical lectures on 
transcendental knowledge given by authorized iiciiryas. Simply by sitting, 
one can learn; then one can eat the remnants of the food offered to God, 
nice palatable dishes. In every state devotional service is joyful. One can 
execute devotional service even in the most poverty-stricken condition. 
The Lord says, patrarh pu§parh phalam: He is ready to accept from the 
devotee any kind of offering, never mind what. Even a leaf, a flower, a bit 
of fruit, or a little water, which are all available in every part of the world, 
can be offered by any person, regardless of social position, and will be 
accepted if offered with love. There are many instances in history. Simply 
by tasting the tulasi leaves offered to the lotus feet of the Lord, great sages 
like Sanatkumara became great devotees. Therefore the devotional process 
is very nice, and it can be executed in a happy mood. God accepts only 
the love with which things are offered to Him. 
It is said here that this devotional service is eternally existing. It is not 
as the Mayavadl philosophers claim. They sometimes take to so-called 
devotional service, and as long as they are not liberated they continue 
their devotional service, but at the end, when they become liberated, they 
"become one with God." Such temporary time-serving devotional service 
is not accepted as pure devotional service. Actual devotional service con­
tinues even after liberation. When the devotee goes to the spiritual planet 
L-
448 
Bhagavad-g!ta As It Is 
[Ch. 9. 
in the kingdom of God, he is also engaged there in serving the Supreme 
Lord. He does not try to become one with the Supreme Lord. 
As it will be seen, actual devotional service begins after liberation. So in 
Bhagavad-gitii it is said, brahma-bhiita. After being liberated, or being 
situated in the Brahman position, one's devotional service begins. By 
executing devotional service, one can understand the Supreme Lord. No 
one can understand the Supreme Personality of Godhead by executing 
karma-yoga, jniina, or a�tiinga-yoga or any other yoga independently. 
Without coming to the stage of devotional service, one cannot understand 
what is the Personality of Godhead. In the Srimad-Bhiigavatam it is also 
confirmed that when one becomes purified by executing the process of 
devotional service, especially by hearing Srimad-Bhiigavatam or Bhagavad­
gitii from realized souls, then he can understand the science of Kr�pa or 
the science of God. Evam prasanna-manaso bhagavad-bhakti-yogataft. 
When one's heart is cleared of all nonsense, then one can understand what 
God is. Thus the process of devotional service, of Kr�J].a consciousness, is 
the king of all education and the king of all confidential knowledge. It is 
the purest form of religion, and it can be executed joyfully without 
difficulty. Therefore one should adopt it.

PURPORT 
The faithless cannot accomplish this process of devotional service; that 
is the purport of this verse. Faith is created by association with devotees. 
Unfortunate people, even after hearing all the evidence of Vedic literature 
from great personalities, still have no faith in God. They are hesitant and 
cannot stay fixed in the devotional service of the Lord. 
Thus faith is a 
most important factor for progress in Kr�tla consciousness. In the Caitanya­
caritiimrta it is said that one should have complete conviction that simply 
by serving the Supreme Lord Sri Kr�Q.a he can achieve all perfection. That 
is called real faith. In the Srimad-Bhiigavatam (3.4.12) it is stated that by 
giving water to the root of a tree, its branches, twigs and leaves become 
satisfied, and by supplying food to the stomach all the senses of the body 
become satisfied, and, similarly, by engaging in the transcendental service 
of the Supreme Lord, all the demigods and all the living entities automati­
cally become satisfied. 
After reading Bhagavad-gitii one should promptly come to the conclu­
sion of Bhagavad-gitii: one should give up all other engagements and adopt 
the service of the Supreme Lord, Kr�tla, the Personality of Godhead. If 
one is convinced of this philosophy oflife, that is faith. Now the develop­
ment of that faith is the process of Kr�tla consciousness. 
There are three divisions of Krwa conscious men. In the third class are 
those who have no faith. If they are engaged in devotional service officially, 
for some ulterior purpose, they cannot achieve the highest perfectional 
stage. Most probably they will slip, after some time. They may become 
engaged, but because they haven't complete conviction and faith, it is very 
difficult for them to continue in Kr�tla consciousness. We have practical 
experience in discharging our missionary activity that some people come 
and apply themselves to the KHt!a consciousness with some hidden motive, 
and as soon as they are economically a little well-situated, they give up this 
process and take to their old ways again. It is only by faith that one can 
advance in Kr�tla consciousness. As far as the development of faith is 
concerned, one who is well versed in the literatures of devotional service 
and has attained the stage of firm faith is called a first-class person in Kr�tla 
consciousness. And in the second class are those who are not very advanced 
in understanding the devotional scriptures but who automatically have 
firm faith that Kr�t!a bhakti or service to Kr�tla is the best course and so in 
good faith have taken it up. Thus they are superior to the third class who 
have neither perfect knowledge of the scriptures nor good faith but by 
association and simplicity are trying to follow. The third-class person in 
450 
Bhagavad-gita As It Is 
[Ch. 9 
Kr�t:ta consciousness may fall down, but when one is in the second class or 
first class, he does not fall down. One in the first class will surely make 
progress and achieve the result at the end. As far as the third-class person 
in Kr�J;la consciousness is concerned, although he has faith in the conviction 
that devotional service to Kr�J;la is very good, he has no knowledge of Kr�J;la 
through the scriptures like Srimad-Bhiigavatam and Bhagavad-gitii. Some­
times these third-class persons in Kr�J).a consciousness have some tendency 
toward karma-yoga and jniina-yoga, and sometimes they are disturbed, but 
as soon as the infection of karma-yoga or jnana-yoga is vanquished, they 
become second-class or first-class persons in Kr�J;la consciousness. Faith in 
Kr�J).a is also divided into three stages and described in Srimad-Bhiigavatam. 
First-class attachment, second-class attachment, and third-class attachment 
are also explained in Srimad-Bhiigavatam in the Eleventh Canto. Those who 
have no faith even after hearing about Kr�J;la and the excellence of devo­
tional service, who think that it is simply eulogy, find the path very diffi­
cult, even if they are supposedly engaged in devotional service. For them 
there is very little hope in gaining perfection. Thus faith is very important 
in the discharge of devotional service.

PURPORT 
The Supreme Personality of Godhead is not perceivable through the 
gross material senses. It is said that Lord Sri Kr�!!a's name, fame, pastimes, 
etc., cannot be understood by material senses. Only to one who is engaged 
in pure devotional service under proper guidance is He revealed. In the 
Brahma-samhitii it is stated, premiiiijanacchurita .
. .
. One can see the Su­
preme Personality of Godhead, Govinda, always within himself and outside 
himself if he has developed the transcendental loving attitude towards Him. 
Thus for people in general He is not visible. Here it is said that although He 
is all-pervading, everywhere present, He is yet not conceivable by the mate­
rial senses. But actually, although we cannot see Him, everything is resting 
in Him. As we have discussed in the Seventh Chapter, the entire material 
cosmic manifestation is only a combination of His two different energies, 
the superior spiritual energy and the inferior material energy. Just as the 
sunshine is spread all over the universe, the energy of the Lord is spread all 
over the creation, and everything is resting in that energy. 
Yet one should not conclude that because He is spread all over He has 
lost His personal existence. To refute such argument the Lord says, "I am 
everywhere, and everything is in Me, but still I am aloof." For example, a 
king heads a government which is but the manifestation of the king's ener­
gy; the different governmental departments are nothing but the energies of 
the king, and each department is resting on the king's power. But still one 
cannot expect the king to be present in every department personally. That 
is a crude example. Similarly, all the manifestations that we see, and every­
thing that exists both in this material world and in the spiritual world, are 
resting on the energy of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. The creation 
takes place by the diffusion of His different energies, and, as is stated in 
the Bhagavad-gitii, He is everywhere present by His petsonal representation, 
the diffusion of His different energies.

And yet everything that is created does not rest in Me. Behold My 
mystic opulence! Although I am the maintainer of all living entities, and 
although I am everywhere, still My Self is the very source of creation. 
PURPORT 
The Lord says that everything is resting on Him. This should not be mis­
understood. The Lord is not directly concerned with the maintenance and 
sustenance of this material manifestation. Sometimes we see a picture of 
Atlas holding the globe on his shoulders; he seems to be very tired, holding 
this great earthly planet. Such an image should not be entertained in 
connection with Kr�Q.a's upholding this created universe. He says that 
although everything is resting on Him, still He is aloof. The planetary 
systems are floating in space, and this space is the energy of the Supreme 
Lord. But He is different from space. He is differently situated. Therefore 
the Lord says, "Although they are situated on My inconceivable energy, 
still, as the Supreme Personality of Godhead, I am aloof from them." This 
is the inconceivable opulence of the Lord. 
In the Vedic dictionary it is said, "The Supreme Lord is performing 
inconceivably wonderful pastimes, displaying His energy. His person is full 
of different potent energies, and His determination is itself actual fact. In 
this way the Personality of Godhead is to be understood." We may think 
to do something, but there are so many impediments, and sometimes it is 
not possible to do as we like. But when Kr�Q.a wants to do something, 
simply by His willing, everything is performed so perfectly that one cannot 
imagine how it is being done. The Lord explains this fact: although He is 
the maintainer and sustainer of all material manifestation, He does not 
touch this material manifestation. Simply by His supreme will everything 
is created, everything is sustained, everything is maintained, and everything 
is annihilated. There is no difference between His mind and Himself (as 
there is a difference between ourselves and our present material mind) 
because He is absolute spirit. Simultaneously the Lord is present in every­
thing; yet the common man cannot understand how He is also present 
Text 6]

personally. He is different from this material manifestation, yet everything 
is resting on Him. This is explained here as yogam aisvaram, the mystic 
power of the Supreme Personality of Godhead.

As the mighty wind, blowing everywhere, always rests in ethereal space,

PURPORT 
For the ordinary person it is almost inconceivable how �he huge ma­
terial creation is resting in Him. But the Lord is giving an example which 
may help us to understand. Space is the biggest manifestation we can 
conceive. The cosmic manifestation rests in space. Space permits the move­
ment of even the atoms and on up to the greatest planets, the sun and the 
moon. Although the sky (or wind or air) is great, still it is situated within 
space. Space is not beyond the sky. 
Similarly, all the wonderful cosmic manifestations are existing by the 
supreme will of God, and all of them are subordinate to that supreme will. 
As we generally say, not a blade of grass moves without the will of the 
Supreme Personality of Godhead. Thus everything is moving under His 
will: by His will everything is being created, everything is being maintained, 
and everything is being annihilated. Still He is aloof from everything, as 
/ 
454 
Bhagavad -gita As It Is 
[Ch. 9 
space is always aloof from the activities of the atmosphere. In the 
Upani§ads, it is stated, "lt is out of the fear of the Supreme Lord that the 
wind is blowing." In the Garga Upani§ad also it is stated, "By the supreme 
order, under the superintendence of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, 
the moon, the sun and the great planets are moving." In the Brahma­
sarhhitii this is also stated. There is also a description of the movement Qf 
the sun, and it is said that the sun is considered to be one of the eyes of the 
Supreme Lord and that it has immense potency to diffuse heat and light. 
Still it is moving in its prescribed orbit by the order and the supreme will 
of Govinda. So, from the Vedic literature we can find evidence that this 
material manifestation, which appears to us to be very wonderful and 
great, is under the complete control of the Supreme Personality of God­
head. This will be further explained in the later verses of this chapter.

Brahma. Brahma lives for one hundred years, and his one day is calculated 
at 4,300,000,000 of our earthly years. His night is of the same duration. 
His month consists of thirty such days and nights, and his year of twelve 
months. After one hundred such years, when Brahma dies, the devastation 
or annihilation takes place; this means that the energy manifested by the 
Supreme Lord is again wound up in Himself. Then again, when there is 
need to manifest the cosmic world, it is done by His will: ''Although I am 
one, I shall become many." This is the Vedic aphorism. He expands Him­
self in this material energy, and the whole cosmic manifestation again takes 
place.

PURPORT 
This matter is the manifestation of the inferior energy of the Supreme 
Personality of Godhead. This has already been explained several times. At 
the creation, the material energy is let loose as mahat-tattva, into which 
the Lord as His first Puru§a incarnation, Maha-Vi��u, enters. He lies within 
456 
Bhagavad-g1ta As It Is 
[Ch. 9 
the Causal Ocean and breathes out innumerable universes, and into each 
universe the Lord again enters as Garbhodakasay1 Vi�J).u. Each universe is in 
that way created. He still further manifests Himself as K�Irodakasay1 
Vi�J;�.U, and that Vi�J;�.U enters into everything-even into the minute atom. 
This fact is explained here. He enters into everything. 
Now, as far as the living entities are concerned, they are impregnated 
into this material nature, and as a result of their past deeds they take 
different positions. Thus the activities of this material world begin. The 
activities of the different species of living beings are begun from the very 
moment of the creation. It is not that all is evolved. The different species 
of life are created immediately along with the universe. Men, animals, 
beasts, birds-everything is simultaneously created, because whatever 
desires the living entities had at the last annihilation are again manifested. 
It is clearly stated here that the living entities hav:e nothing to do with this 
process. The state of being in their past life in the past creation is simply 
manifested again, and all this is done simply by His will. This is the incon­
ceivable potency of the Supreme Personality of God. And after creating 
different species of life, He has no connection with them. The creation 
takes place to accommodate the inclinations of the various living entities, 
and so the Lord does not become involved with it.

PURPORT 
One should not think, in this connection, that the Supreme Personality 
of Godhead has no engagement. In His spiritual world He is always engaged. 
In the Brahma-samhitii it is stated: "He is always involved in His eternal, 
blissful, spiritual activities, but He has nothing to do with these material 
J 
activities." Material activities are being carried on by His different poten-
cies. The Lord is always neutral in the material activities of the created 
world. This neutrality is explained here. Although He has c<;mtrol over 
every minute detail of matter, He is sitting as if neutral. The example can 
be given of a high court judge sitting on his bench. By his order so many 
things are happening: someone is being hanged, someone is being put into 
jail, someone is awarded a huge amount of wealth-but still he is neutral. 
He has nothing to do with all that gain and loss. Similarly, the Lord is 
always neutral, although He has His hand in every sphere of activity. In the 
Vediinta-siitra it is stated that He is not situated in the dualities of this 
material world. He is transcendental to these dualities. Nor is He attached 
to the creation and annihilation of this material world. The living entities 
take their different forms in the various species of life according to their 
past deeds, and the Lord doesn't interfere with them.

[Ch. 9 
PURPORT 
It is clearly stated here that the Supreme Lord, although aloof from all 
the activities of the material world, remains the supreme director. The 
Supreme Lord is the supreme will and the background of this material 
manifestation, but the management is being conducted by material nature. 
Kr�J}a also states in Bhagavad-gitii that of all the living entities in different 
forms and species, "I am the Father." The father gives seeds to the womb 
of the mother for the child, and similarly the Supreme Lord by His mere 
glance injects all the living entities into the womb of material nature, and 
they come out in their different forms and species, according to their last 
desires and activities. All these living entities, although born under the 
glance of the Supreme Lord, still take their different bodies according to 
their past deeds and desires. So the Lord is not directly attached to this 
material creation. He simply glances over material nature; material nature 
is thus activated, and everything is created immediately. Because He glances 
over material nature, there is undoubtedly activity on the part of the 
Supreme Lord, but He has nothing to do with the manifestation of the 
material world directly. This example is given in the smrti: when there is a 
fragrant flower before someone, the fragrance is touched by the smelling 
power of the person, yet the smelling and the flower are detached from one 
another. There is a similar connection between the material world and the 
Supreme Personality of Godhead; actually He has nothing to do with this 
material world, but He creates by His glance and ordains. ln summary, 
material nature, without the superintendence of the Supreme Personality 
of Godhead, cannot do anything. Yet the Supreme Personality is detached 
from all material activities.

TRANSLATION 
Fools deride Me when I descend in the human form. They do not know 
My transcendental nature and My supreme dominion over all that be. 
PURPORT 
From the other explanations of the previous verses in this chapter, it is 
clear that the Supreme Personality of Godhead, although appearing like a 
human being, is not a common man. The Personality of Godhead, who 
conducts the creation, maintenance and annihilation of the complete 
cosmic manifestation, cannot be a human being. Yet there are many 
foolish men who consider Kr�:pa to be merely a powerful man and nothing 
more. Actually, He is the original Supreme Personality, as is confirmed in· 
the Brahma-samhitii (iSvarafl paramafl kmwfl); He is the Supreme Lord. 
There are many iSvaras, controllers, and one appears greater than an­
other. ln the ordinary management of affairs in the material world, we 
find some official or director, and above him there is a secretary, and above 
him a minister, and above him a president. Each of them is a controller, 
but one is controlled by another. In the Btahma-samhitii it is said that 
Kr�p.a is the supreme controller; there are many controllers undoubtedly 
both in the material and spiritual world, but Kr�JJ.a is the supreme con­
troller (isvarafl parama[l kr§rw/l), and His body is sac-cid-iinanda, non­
material. 
Material bodies cannot perform the wonderful acts described in previous 
verses. His body is eternal, blissful and full of knowledge. Although He is 
not a common man, the foolish deride Him and consider Him to be a man. 
His body is called here miinu§im because He is acting just like a man, a 
friend of Arjuna's, a politician involved in the Battle of Kuruk�etra. In so 
many ways He is acting just like an ordinary man, but actually His body is 
sac-cid-iinanda-vigraha -eternal bliss and knowledge absolute. This is con­
firmed in the Vedic language also (sac-cid-iinanda-riipiiya knriiya): "l offer 
my obeisances unto the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Kr�r;ta, who 
is the eternal blissful form of knowledge." There are other descrip­
tions in the Vedic 
language also. Tam ekarh govindam: "You are 
Govinda, the pleasure of the senses and the cows." Sac-cid-iinanda­
vigraham: "And Your form is transcendental, full of knowledge, bliss and 
eternality." 
Despite the transcendental qualities of Lord Kr�JJ.a's body, its full 
bliss and knowledge, there are many so-called scholars and commentators 
460 
Bhagavad -gita As It Is 
[Ch. 9 
of Bhagavad-gitii who deride Kr�!Ja as an ordinary man. The scholar may 
be born an extraordinary man due to his previous good work, but this con­
ception of Sci Kr�!Ja is due to a poor fund of knowledge. Therefore he is 
called mu!Zha, for only foolish persons consider Kr�!Ja to be an ordinary 
human being because they do not know the confidential activities of the 
Supreme Lord and His different energies. They do not know that Kr�!Ja's 
body is a symbol of complete knowledge and bliss, that He is the proprietor 
of everything that be and that He can award liberation to anyone. Because 
they do not know that Kr�!Ja has so many transcendental qualifications, 
they deride Him. 
Nor do they know that the appearance of the Supreme Personality of 
Godhead in this material world is a manifestation of His internal energy. 
He is the master of the material energy. As has been explained in several 
places (mama miiyii duratyaya), He claims that the material energy, al­
though very powerful, is under His control, and whoever surrenders unto 
Him cah get out of the control of this material energy. If a soul surren­
dered to Krwa. can get out of the influence of material energy, then how 
can the Supreme Lord, who conducts the creation, maintenance and 
annihilation of the whole cosmic nature, have a material body like us? So 
this conception of Kr�!Ja is complete foolishness. Foolish persons, however, 
cannot conceive that the Personality of Godhead, Kr��a, appearing just 
like an ordinary man, can be the controller of all the atoms and of the 
gigantic manifestation of the universal form. The biggest and the minutest 
are beyond their conception, so they cannot imagine that a form like that 
of a human being can simultaneously control the infinite and the minute. 
Actually although He is controlling the infinite and the finite, He is apart 
from all this manifestation. It is clearly stated concerning His yogam 
aisvaram, His inconceivable transcendental energy, that He can control the 
infinite and the finite simultaneously and that He can remain aloof from 
them. Although the foolish cannot imagine how Kr�!Ja, who appears just 
like a human being, can control the infinite and the finite, those who are 
pure devotees accept this, for they know that Kr�!Ja is the Supreme Per­
sonality of Godhead. Therefore they completely surrender unto Him and 
engage in Kr�!Ja consciousness, devotional service of the Lord. 
There are many controversies amongst .the impersonalists and the person­
alists about the Lord's appearance as a human being. But if we consult 
Bhagavad-gita and Srimad-Bhiigavatam, the authoritative texts for under­
standing the science of Kr�!Ja, then we can understand that Kr��a is the 
Supreme Personality of Godhead. He is not an ordinary man, although He 
appeared on this earth as an ordinary human. In the Srimad-Bhiigavatam, 
Text ll] 
The Most Confidential Knowledge 
461 
First Canto, First Chapter, when the sages inquire about the activities of 
Krwa, it 1s stated that His appearance as a man bewilders the foolish. No 
human being could perform the wonderful acts that Kr�pa performed while 
He was present on this earth. When Kr�pa appeared before His father and 
mother, Vasudeva and Devaki, He appeared with four hands, but after the 
prayers of the parents, He transformed Himself into an ordinary child. His 
appearance as an ordinary human being is one of the features of His tran­
scendental body. In the Eleventh Chapter of the Gitii also it is stated, 
tenaiva riiper-a etc. Arjuna prayed to see again that form of four hands, 
and when Kn;IJ.a was thus petitioned by Arjuna, He again assumed His 
original form. All these different features of the Supreme Lord are cer­
tainly not those of an ordinary human being. 
Some of those who deride Kr�IJ.a, who are infected with the Mayavadi 
philosophy, quote the following verse from the Srimad-Bhiigavatam to 
prove 
that 
Kr�IJ.a is just an ordinary man: 
aham saroe§u bhiite§u 
bhiitiitmiivasthita� sadii: "The Supreme is present in every living entity." 
(Bhiig. 3.29.21) We should better take note 9f this particular verse from 
the V ai�IJ.ava iiciiryas like Jiva Gosvami instead of following the interpreta­
tion of unauthorized persons who deride Kr�IJ.a. Jiva Gosvami, commenting 
on this verse, says that Kr�IJ.a, in His plenary expansion as Paramatma, is 
situated in the moving and the nonmoving entities as the Supersoul, so any 
neophyte devotee who simply gives his attention to the arca-miirti, the 
form of the Supreme Lord in the temple, and does not respect other living 
entities is uselessly worshiping the form of the Lord in the temple. There 
are three kinds of devotees of the Lord, and the neophyte is in the lowest 
stage. The neophyte devotee gives more attention to the Deity in the 
temple than to other devotees, so Jiva Gosvami warns that this sort of 
mentality should be corrected. A devotee should see that Kr�IJ.a is present 
in everyone's heart as Paramatma; therefore every body is the embodiment 
or the temple of the Supreine Lord, and as such, as one offers respect to 
the temple of the Lord, he should similarly properly respect each and 
every body in whom the Paramatma dwells. Everyone should therefore be 
given proper respect and should not be neglected. 
There are also many impersonalists who deride temple worship. They 
say that since God is everywhere, why should one restrict himself to 
temple worship? But if God is everywhere, is He not in the temple or in 
the Deity? Although the personalist and the impersonalist will fight with 
one another perpetually, a perfect devotee in Kr�IJ.a consciousness knows 
that although Kr�IJ.a is the Supreme Personality, He is all-pervading, as is 
confirmed in the Brahma-samhitii. Although His personal abode is Goloka 
462 
Bhagavad·gita As It Is 
[Ch.9 
Vrndavana and He is always staying there, still, by His different manifesta­
tions of energy and by His plenary expansion, He is present everywhere in 
all parts of the material and spiritual creation.

TRANSLATION 
Those who are thus bewildered are attracted by demonic and atheistic 
views. In that deluded condition, their hopes for liberation, their fruitive 
activities, and their culture of knowledge are all defeated. 
PURPORT 
There are many devotees who assume themselves to be in Kr�J)a con­
s(:iousness and devotional service but at heart do not accept the Supreme 
Personality of Godhead, Kr�J).a, as the Absolute Truth. For them, the fruit 
of devotional service-going back to Godhead-will never be tasted. Simi­
larly, those who are engaged in fruitive, pious activities and who are ulti­
mately hoping to be liberated from this material entanglement will never 
be successful either because they deride the Supreme Personality of 
Godhead, Kr�J).a. In other words, persons who mock Kr�J).a are to be under­
stood to be demonic or atheistic. As described in the Seventh Chapter of 
Text 13 J 
The Most Confidential Knowledge 
463 
Bhagavad-gitii, such demonic miscreants never surrender to Kr�tJ.a. There­
fore their mental speculations to arrive at the Absolute Truth bring them 
to the false conclusion that the ordinary living entity and Kr�Q.a are one 
and the same. With such a false conviction, they think that the body of 
any human being is now simply covered by material nature. and that as 
soon as one is liberated from this material body there is no difference 
between God and himself. This attempt to become one with Kr�tJ.a will be 
baffled because of delusion. Such atheistic and demoniac cultivation of 
spiritual knowledge is always futile. That is the indication of this verse. 
For such persons, cultivation of the knowledge in the Vedic literature, like 
the Vediinta-siitra and the Upani§ads, is always baffled. 
It is a great offense, therefore, to consider Kr�tJ.a, the Supreme Person­
ality of Godhead, to be an ordinary man. Those who do so are certainly 
deluded because they cann.ot understand the eternal form of Kr�tJ.a. In the 
Brhad-vai§rava mantra it is clearly stated that one who considers the body 
of Kr�Q.a to be material should be driven out from all rituals and activities 
of the sruti. And if one by chance sees his face, he should at once take 
bath in the Ganges to rid himself of infection. People jeer at Kr�Q.a because 
they are envious of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Their destiny is 
certainly to take birth after birth in the species of atheistic and demoniac 
life. Perpetually, their real knowledge will remain under delusion, and 
gradually they will regress to the darkest region of creation.

0 son of Prtha, those who are not deluded, the great souls, are under 
the protection of the divine nature. They are fully engaged in devotional 
service because they know Me as the Supreme Personality of Godhead, 
original and inexhaustible. 
PURPORT 
In this verse the description of mahatma is clearly given. The first sign of 
the mahiitmii is that he is already situated in the divine nature. He is not 
under the control of material nature. And how is this effected? That is 
explained in the Seventh Chapter: one who surrenders unto the Supreme 
Personality of Godhead, Sri Kr�J,J.a, at once becomes freed from the control 
of material nature. That is the qualification. One can become free from the 
control of material nature as soon as he surrenders his soul to the Supreme 
Personality of Godhead. That is the preliminary formula. Being marginal 
potency, as soon as the living entity is freed from the control of material 
nature, he is put under the guidance of the spiritual nature. The guidance 
of the spiritual nature is called daivim prakrtim, divine nature. So, when one 
is promoted in that way-by surrendering to the Supreme Personality of 
Godhead-one attains to the stage of great soul, mahatma. 
The mahatma does not divert his attention to anything outside Krtipa 
because he knows perfectly well that Kr�J,J.a is the original Supreme Person, 
the cause of all causes. There is no doubt about it. Such a mahatma, or 
great soul, 
develops 
through association with other mahatmas, pure 
devotees. Pure devotees are not even attracted by Kr�J,J.a's other features, 
such as the four-armed .Maha-Vi�J,J.U. They are simply attracted by the two­
armed form of Kr�J,J.a. Since they are not attracted to other features of 
Kn;J,J.a (what to speak of the demigods), they are not concerned with any 
form of a demigod or of a human being. They only meditate upon Kr�J,J.a 
in Kr�J,J.a consciousness. They are always engaged in the unswerving service 
of the Lord in Kr�J,J.a consciousness.

Always chanting My glories, endeavoring with great determination, bowing

PURPORT 
The mahiitmii cannot be manufactured by rubber-stamping an ordinary 
man. His symptoms are described here: a mahiitmii is always engaged in 
chanting the glories of the Supreme Lord Kn;Q.a, the Personality of God­
head. He has no other business. He is always engaged in the glorification of 
the Lord. In other words, he is not an impersonalist. When the question of 
glorification is there, one has to glorify the Supreme Lord, praising His 
holy name, His eternal form, His transcendental qualities and His uncom­
mon pastimes. One has to glorify all these things; therefore a mahiitmii is 
attached to the Supreme Personality of Godhead. 
One who is attached to the impersonal feature of the Supreme Lord, the 
brahmajyoti, is not described as mahiitmii in the Bhagavad-gitii. He is 
described in a different way in the next verse. The mahiitmii is always 
engaged in different activities of devotional service, as described in the 
Srimad-Bhiigavatam, hearing and chanting about Vi�pu, not a demigod or 
human being. That is devotion: sravaflarh kirtanam v'4flofl, smarapam, and 
remembering Him. Such a mahiitmii has firm determination to achieve at 
the ultimate end the association of the Supreme Lord in any one of the 
five transcendental rasas. To achieve that success, he engages all activities­
mental, bodily and vocal, everything-in the service of the Supreme Lord, 
Sri Kr�Qa. That is called full Kr�Q.a consciousness. 
In devotional service there are certain activities which are called deter­
mined, such as fasting on certain days, like the eleventh day of the moon, 
466 
Bhagavad-gita As It Is 
[Ch. 9 
Ekiidasi, and on the appearance day of the Lord, etc. All these rules and 
regulations are offered by the great acaryas for those who are actually 
interested in getting admission into the association of the Supreme Person­
ality of Godhead in the transcendental world. The mahiitmiis, great souls, 
strictly observe all these rules and regulations, and therefore they are sure 
to achieve the desired result. 
As described in the second verse of this chapter, this devotional service 
is not only easy, but it can be performed in a happy mood. One does not 
need to undergo any severe penance and austerity. He can live this life in 
devotional service, guided by an expert spiritual master, and in any posi­
tion, either as a householder or a sannyiisi, or a brahmacari; in any position 
and anywhere in the world, he can perform this devotional service to the 
Supreme Personality of Godhead and thus become actually mahatma, a 
great soul.

PURPORT 
This verse is the summary of the previous verses. The Lord tells A�una 
that those who are purely in Kr�Q.a consciousness and do not know any­
thing other than Kr�Q.a are called mahatma; yet there are other persons who 
Text 16] 
The Most Confidential Knowledge 
467 
are not exactly in the position of mahatma but who worship Kr�l).a also, in 
different ways. Some of them are already described as the distressed, the 
financially destitute, the 
inquisitive, 
and those who are engaged in 
the cultivation of knowledge. But there are others who are still lower, 
and these are divided into three: 1) He who worships himself as one 
with the Supreme Lord, 2) He who concocts some form of the Supreme 
Lord and worships that, and 3) He who accepts the universal form, the 
visvariipa of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and worships that. Out 
of the above three, the lowest, those who worship themselves as the 
Supreme Lord, thinking themselves to be monists, are most predominant. 
Such people think themselves to be the Supreme Lord, and in this men­
tality they worship themselves. This is also a type of God worship, for 
they can understand that they are not the material body but are actually 
spiritual soul; at least, such a sense is prominent. Generally the imperson­
alists worship the Supreme Lord in this way. The second class includes the 
worshipers of the demigods, those who by imagination consider any form 
to be the form of the Supreme Lord. And the third class includes those 
who cannot conceive of anything beyond the manifestation of this material 
universe. They consider the universe to be the supreme organism or entity 
and worship that. The universe is also a form of the Lord.

butter, is also Kr�I]a. The mantras chanted in this connection are also 
Kr�I]a. And many other commodities made with milk products for offer­
ing in the sacrifices are also Kr�I]a. The fire is also Kr�I]a because fire is one 
of the five material elements and is therefore claimed as the separated 
energy of Kr�I]a. In other words, the Vedic sacrifices recommended in the 
karma-kiir-!la division of the Vedas are in total also Kr�I]a. Or, in other 
words, those who are engaged in rendering devotional service unto Kr�I]a 
are to be understood to have performed all the sacrifices recommended in 
the Vedas.

actually they are parts and parcels of Kr�l).a. As such, these living entities 
who appear to be our father, mother, etc., are nothing but Kr�l).a. In this 
verse the word dhiitii means creator. Not only are our father and mother 
parts and parcels of Kr�l).a, but their creator, grandmother, and grand­

Whatever we want to know through the Vedas is but a progressive step to 
understand Kr�l).a. That subject matter which helps us purify our constitu­
tional position is especially Kr�l).a. Similarly, the living entity who is inquisi­
itive to understand all Vedic principles is also part and parcel of Kr�l).a and 
as such is also Kr�l).a. In all the Vedic mantras the word om, called 
prap,ava, is a transcendental sound vibration and is also Kr�l).a. And because 
in all the hymns of the four Vedas, Siima, Yajur, f{g and Atharva, the

Gati means the destination where we want to go. But the ultimate goal 
is Kr��Ja, although people do not know it. One who does not know Kr��Ja 
is misled, and his so-called progressive march is either partial or hallucinato­
ry. There are many who make as their destination different demigods, and 
by rigid performance of the strict respective methods they reach different 
planets known as Candraloka, Suryaloka, Indraloka, Maharloka, etc. But 
all such lokas or planets, being creations of Kr�J]a, are simultaneously Kr��J.a 
and not Kr��Ja. Actually such planets, being the manifestations of Kr�1_1a's 
energy, are also Kr��J.a, but actually they only serve as a step forward for 
realization of Kr��Ja. To approach the different energies of Kr��Ja is to ap­
proach Kr�!Ja indirectly. One should directly approach Kr��Ja, for that will 
save time and energy. For example, if there is a possibility of going to the 
top of a building by the help of an elevator, why should one go by the 
staircase, step by step? Everything is resting on Kr�J]a's energy; therefore 
without Kr��Ja's shelter nothing can exist. Kr��Ja is the supreme ruler be­
cause everything belongs to Him and everything exists on His energy. 
Kr��Ja, being situated in everyone's heart, is the supreme witness. The 
residences, countries or planets on which we live are also Kr��J.a. Kr��Ja is 
the ultimate goal of shelter, and as such one should take shelter of Kr��J.a 
either for protection or for annihilation of his distressed condition. And 
whenever we have to take protection, we should know that our protection 
must be a living force. Thus Kr��J.a is the supreme living entity. Since 
Kr��Ja is the source of our generation, or the supreme father, no one can be 
a better friend than Kr��J.a, nor can anyone be a better well-wisher. Kr��Ja 
is the original source of creation and the ultimate rest after annihilation. 
Kr��Ja is therefore the eternal cause of all causes.

PURPORT 
Kr�I]a, by His different energies, diffuses heat and light through the 
agency of electricity and the sun. During summer season it is Kr�I]a who 
checks rain from falling from the sky, and then, during the rainy season, 
He gives unceasing torrents of rain. The energy which sustains us by pro­
longing the duration of our life is Kr�I]a, and Kr�l]a meets us at the end as 
death. By analyzing all these different energies of Kr�I]a, one can acertain 
that for Kr�l]a there is no distinction between matter and spirit, or, in other 
words, He is both matter and spirit. In the advanced stage of Kr�I]a con­
sciousness, one does not therefore make such distinctions. He sees Kr�I]a 
only in everything. 
Since Kr�l]a is both matter and spirit, the gigantic universal form com­
prising all material manifestations is also Kr�I]a, and His pastimes in 
Vrndavana as two-handed Syamasundara, playing on a flute, are those of 
the Supreme Personality of Godhead.

TRANSLATION 
Those who study the Vedas and drink the soma juice, seeking the 
heavenly planets, worship Me indirectly. They take birth on the planet of 
Indra, where they enjoy godly delights. 
PURPORT 
The word trai-vidyii� refers to the three Vedas, Siima, Yajur and If-g. A 
briihmarta who has studied these three Vedas is called a tri-vedi. Anyone 
who is very much attached to knowledge derived from these three Vedas is 
respected in society. Unfortunately, there are many great scholars of the 
Vedas who do not know the ultimate purport of studying them. Therefore 
Kr�I).a herein declares Himself to be the ultimate goal for the tri-vedis. 
Actual tri-vedis take shelter under the lotus feet of Kr�I).a and engage in 
pure devotional service to satisfy the Lord. Devotional service hegins with 
the chanting of the Hare Kr�I).a mantra and side by side trying to understand 
Kr�I).a in truth. Unfortunately those who are simply official students .of 
the Vedas become more interested in offering sacrifices to the different 
demigods like lndra, Candra, etc. By such endeavor, the worshipers of 
different demigods are certainly purified of the contamination of the 
lower qualities of nature and are thereby elevated to the higher planetary 
system or heavenly planets known as Maharloka, J analoka, Tapoloka, etc. 
Once situated on those higher planetary systems, one can satisfy his senses 
hundreds of thousands of times better than on this planet.

When they have thus enjoyed heavenly sense pleasure, they return to

only flickering happiness. 
PURPORT 
One who is promoted to those higher planetary systems enjoys a longer 
duration of life and better facilities for sense enjoyment, yet one is not 
allowed to stay there forever. One is again sent back to this earthly planet 
upon finishing the resultant fruits of pious activities. He who has not 
attained perfection of knowledge, as indicated in the Vediinta-siltra 
(janmiidy asya yataM, or, in other words, he who fails to understand Kr�pa, 
the cause of all causes, becomes baffled in achieving the ultimate goal of 
life and is thus subjected to the routine of being promoted to the higher 
planets and then again coming down, as if situated on a ferris wheel 
which sometimes goes up and sometimes comes down. The purport is that 
instead of being elevated to the spiritual world where there is no longer any 
possibility of coming down, one simply revolves in the cycle of birth and 
death on higher and lower planetary systems. One should better take to 
the spiritual world to enjoy eternal life full of bliss and knowledge and 
never return to this miserable material existence.

One who is unable to live for a moment without Kr�I}.a consciousness 
cannot but think of Kr�I}.a twenty-four hours, being engaged in devotional 
service by hearing, chanting, remembering, offering prayers, worshiping, 
serving the lotus feet of the Lord, rendering other services, cultivating 
friendship and surrendering fully to the Lord. Such activities are all 
auspicious and full of spiritual potencies; indeed, they make the devotee 
perfect in self-realization. Then his only desire is to achieve the association 
of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. This is called yoga. By the mercy 
of the Lord, such a devotee never comes back to this material condition of 
life. K§ema refers to the merciful protection of the Lord. The Lord helps 
the devotee to achieve Kr�I}.a consciousness by yoga, and when he becomes 
fully Kr�I}.a conscious the Lord protects him from falling down to a miser­
able conditioned life.

"Persons who are engaged in the worship of demigods are not very 
intelligent, although such worship is done to Me indirectly," Kr�l).a says. 
For example, when a man pours water on the leaves and branches of a 
tree without pouring water on the root, he does so without sufficient 
knowledge or without observing regulative principles. Similarly, the 
process of rendering service to different parts of the body is to supply 
food to the stomach. The demigods are, so to speak, different officers and 
directors in the government of the Supreme Lord. One has to follow the 
laws made by the government, not by the officers or directors. Similarly, 
everyone is to offer his worship to the Supreme Lord only. That will 
automatically satisfy the different officers and directors of the Lord. The 
officers and directors are engaged as representatives of the government, 
and to offer some bribe to the officers and directors is illegal. This is 
stated here as avidhi-pfirvakam. In other words, Kr�l).a does not approve the 
unnecessary worship of the demigods.

I am the only enjoyer and the only object of sacrifice. Those who do

PURPORT 
Here it is clearly stated that there are many types of yajfia performances 
recommended in the Vedic literatures, but actually all of them are meant 
for satisfying the Supreme Lord. Yajfia means Vi�pu. In the Second 
Chapter of Bhagavad-gitii it is clearly stated that one should only work for 
satisfying Yajfia or Vi�pu. The perfectional form of human civilization, 
known as varrtiisrama-dharma, is specifically meant for satisfying Vi�pu. 
Therefore, J<.r�r;ta says in this verse, "I am the enjoyer of all sacrifices be­
cause I am the supreme master." However, less intelligent persons, without 
knowing this fact, worship demigods for temporary benefit. Therefore they 
fall down to material existence and do not achieve the desired goal of life. 
If, however, anyone has any material desire to be fulfilled, he had better 
pray for it to the Supreme Lord (although that is not pure devotion), and 
he will thus achieve the desired result.

PURPORT 
If anyone has any desire to go to the moon, the sun, or any other planet, 
one can attain the desired destination by following specific Vedic principles 
recommended for that purpose. These are vividly described in the fruitive 
activities portion of the Vedas, technically known as darsa-paurrwmasi, 
which recommends a specific worship of demigods situated on different 
heavenly planets. Similarly , one can attain the pita planets by performing 
. a specific yajiia. Similarly, one can go to many ghostly planets and become 
a yak§a, rak§a or pisaca. Pisaca worship is called "black arts" or "black 
magic." There are many men who practice this black art, and they think 
that it is spiritualism, but such activities are completely materialistic. 
Similarly, a pure devotee, who worships the Supreme Personality of God-
head only, achieves the planets of Vaiku!ltha and Kr�l}.aloka without a 
doubt. It is very easy to understand through this important verse that if 
by simply worshiping the demigods one can achieve the heavenly planets, 
or by worshiping the pita achieve the pita planets, or by practicing the 
black arts achieve the ghostly planets, why can the pure devotee not 
achieve the planet of Kr�l}.a or Vi�tm? Unfortunately many people have no 
information of these sublime planets where 1\r�l}.a and Vi�tm live, and 
because they do not know of them they fall down. Even the impersonal­
ists fall down from the brahmajyoti. This Kr�l,la consciousness movement 
is therefore distributing sublime information to the entire human society 
to the effect that by simply chanting the Hare Kr�l,la mantra one can be­
come perfect in this life and go back home, hack to Godhead.

TRANSLATION 
If one offers Me with love and devotion a leaf, a flower, fruit or 
water, I will accept it. 
PURPORT 
Here Lord Kr�Q.a, having established that He is the only enjoyer, the 
primeval Lord, and the real object of all sacrificial offerings, reveals what 
types of sacrifices He desires to be offered. If one wishes to engage in devo­
tional service to the Supreme in order to be purified and to reach the goal 
of life-the transcendental loving service of God-then he should find out 
what the Lord desires of him. One who loves Kr�Q.a will give Him whatever 
He wants, and he avoids offering anything which is undesirable or unasked 
for. Thus, meat, fish and eggs should not be offered to Kr�Q.a. If He desired 
such things as offerings, He would have said so. Instead He clearly requests 
that a leaf, fruit, flowers and water be given to Him, and He says of this 
offering, "I will accept it." Therefore, we should understand that He will 
not accept meat, fish and eggs. Vegetables, grains, fruits, milk and water 
are the proper foods for human beings and are prescribed by Lord Kr�Q.a 
Himself. Whatever else we eat cannot be offered to Him, since He will not 
accept it. Thus we cannot be acting on the level of loving devotion if we 
offer such foods. 
In the Third Chapter, verse thirteen, Sri Kr�Q.a explains that only the 
remains of sacrifice are purified and fit for consumption by those who are 
seeking advancement in life and release from the clutches of the material 
entanglement. Those who do not make an offering of their food, He says 
in the same verse, are said to be eating only sin. In other words, their every 
mouthful is simply deepening their involvement in the complexities of 
material nature. But preparing nice, simple vegetable dishes, offering them 
before the picture or Deity of Lord Kr�Q.a and bowing down and praying 
.\ 
Text 27] 
The Most Confidential Knowledge 
479 
for Him to accept such a humble offering, enable one to advance steadily 
in life, to purify the body, and to create fine brain tissues which will lead 
to clear thinking. Above all, the offering should be made with an attitude 
of love. Kr�IJ.a has no need of food, since He already possesses everything 
that be, yet He will accept the offering of one who desires to please Him in 
that way. The important element, in preparation, in serving and in offer­
ing, is to act with love for Kr�IJ.a. 
The impersonalist philosophers, who wish to maintain that the Absolute 
Truth is without senses, cannot comprehend this verse of Bhagavad-gitii. 
To them, it is either a metaphor or proof of the mundane character of 
Kr�IJ.a, the speaker of the Gitii. But, in actuality, Kr�IJ.a, the Supreme God­
head, has senses, and it is stated that His senses are interchangeable; in 
other words, one sense can perform the function of any other. This is 
what it means to say that Kr�IJ.a is absolute. Lacking senses, He could 
hardly be considered full in all opulences. In the Seventh Chapter, Kr�IJ.a 
has explained that He impregnates the living entities into material nature. 
This is done by His looking upon material nature. And so in this instance, 
Kr�IJ.a's hearing the devotee's words of love in offering foodstuffs is 
wholly identical with His eating and actually tasting. This point should be 
emphasized: because of His absolute position, His hearing is wholly identi­
cal with His eating and tasting. Only the devotee, who accepts Kr�IJ.a as He 
describes Himself, without interpretation, can understand that the Supreme 
Absolute Truth can eat food and enjoy it.

Thus, it is the duty of everyone to mold his life in such a way that he will 
not forget Kr�l)a in any circumstance. Everyone has to. work for mainte­
nance of his body and soul together, and Kr�l)a recommends herein that 
one should work for Him. Everyone has to eat something to live; therefore 
he should accept the remnants of foodstuffs offered to Kr�l)a. Any 
civilized man has to perform some religious ritualistic ceremonies; therefore 
Kr�l)a recommends, "Do it for Me," and this is called arcana. Everyone 
has a tendency to give something in charity; Kr�l)a says, "Give it to Me," 
and this means that all surplus money accummulated should be utilized in 
furthering the Kr�l)a consciousness movement. Nowadays people are very 
much inclined to the meditational process, which is not practical in this 
age, but if anyone practices meditating on Kr�l)a twenty-four hours by 
chanting the Hare Kr�l)a mantra round his beads, he is surely the greatest 
yogi, as substantiated by the Sixth Chapter of Bhagavad-gita.

\, ;Y 
One who acts in Kr�J)a consciousness under superior direction is called 
yukta. The technical term is yukta-vairiigya. This is further explained by 
Riipa Gosvaml as follows. 
Riipa Gosvaml says that as long as we are in this material world we have 
to act; we cannot cease acting. Therefore if actions are performed and the 
fruits are given to Kr�J)a, then that is called yukta-vairiigya. Actually 
situated in renunciation, such activities clear the mirror of the mind, and 
as the actor gradually makes progress in spiritual realization he becomes 
completely surrendered to the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Therefore 
at the end he becomes liberated, and this liberation is also specified. By 
this liberation he does not become one with the brahmajyot� but rather 
enters into the planet of the Supreme Lord. It is clearly mentioned here: 
miim upai§yasi, "he comes to Me," back home, back to Godhead. There 
are five different stages of liberation, and here it is specified that the 
devotee who has always lived his lifetime here under the direction of the 
Supreme Lord, as stated, has evolved to the point where he can, after 
quitting this body, go hack to Godhead and engage directly in the 
association of the Supreme Lord. 
Anyone who has no other interest but to dedicate his life to the service 
of the Lord is actually a sannyiisi. Such a person always thinks of himself 
as an eternal servant, dependant on the supreme will of the Lord. As such, 
whatever he does, he does it for the benefit of the Lord. Whatever action 
he performs, he performs it as service to the Lord. He does not give serious 
attention to the fruitive activities or prescribed duties mentioned in the 
Vedas. For ordinary persons it is obligatory to execute the prescribed 
duties mentioned in the Vedas, but although a pure devotee who is com­
pletely engaged in the senice of the Lord may sometimes appear to go 
against the prescribed Vedic duties, actually it is not so. 
It is said, therefore, by V ai�pava authorities that even the most intelli­
gent person cannot understand the plans and activities of a pure devotee. 
The exact words are vainwvera kriyii mudrii vijiie nii bujhayii. A person 
who is thus always engaged in the service of the Lord or is always thinking 
and planning how to serve the Lord is to be considered completely 
liberated at present and in the future. His going home, back to Godhead, 
482

above all criticism.

I envy no one, nor am I partial to anyone. I am equal to all. But who­
ever renders service unto Me in devotion is a friend, is in Me, and I am 
also a friend to him. 
PURPORT 
One may question here that if Kr�l)a is equal to everyone and no one is 
His special friend, then why does He take a special interest in the devotees 
who are always engaged in His transcendental service? But this is not 
discrimination; it is natural. Any man in this material world may be very 
charitably disposed, yet he has a special interest in his own children. The 
Lord claims that every living entity-'-in whatever form-is His son, and as 
such He provides everyone with a generous supply of the necessities of life. 
He is just like a cloud which pours rain all over, regardless whether it falls 
on rock or land or water. But for His devotees, He gives specific attention. 
Such devotees are mentioned here: they are always in Kr�l)a consciousness, 
and therefore they are always transcendentally situated in Kr�J)a. The very 
phrase Kr�l)a consciousness suggests that those who are in such conscious­
ness are living transcendentalists, situated in Him. The Lord says here 
distinctly, "mayi te," "in Me." Naturally, as a result, the Lord is also in 
them. This is reciprocal. This also explains the words: asti na priyaMye 
bhajanti: "Whoever surrenders unto Me, proportionately I take care of 
Text 30) 
The Most Confidential Knowledge 
483 
him." This transcendental reciprocation exists because both the Lord and 
the devotee are conscious. When a diamond is set in a golden ring, it looks 
very nice. The gold is glorified, and at the same time the diamond is glori­
fied. The Lord and the living entity eternally glitter, and when a living 
entity becomes inclined to the service of the Supreme Lord, he looks 
like gold. The Lord is a diamond, and so this combination is very nice. 
Living entities in a pure state are called devotees. The Supreme Lord 
becomes the devotee of His devotees. If a reciprocal relationship is not 
present between the devotee and the Lord, then there is no personalist 
philosophy. In the impersonal philosophy there is no reciprocation between 
the Supreme and the living entity, but in the personalist philosophy there is. 
The example is often given that the Lord is like a desire tree, and what­
ever one wants from this desire tree, the Lord supplies. But here the 
explanation is more complete. The Lord is here stated to be partial to the 
devotees. This is the manifestation of the Lord's special mercy to the 
devotees. The Lord's reciprocation should not be considered to be under 
the law of karma. It belongs to the transcendental situation in_which the 
Lord and His devotees function. Devotional service of the Lord is not an 
activity of this material world; it is part of the spiritual world where eter­
nity, bliss and knowledge predominate.

Bhagavad-gita As It Is 
[Ch. 9 
PURPORT 
The word suduriiciiro used in this verse is very significant, and we should 
understand it properly. When a living entity is conditioned, he has two 
kinds of activities: one is conditional, and the other is constitutional. As 
for protecting the body or abiding by the rules of society and state, 
certainly there are different activities, even for the devotees, in connection 
with the conditional life, and such activities are called conditional. Besides 
these, the living entity who is fully conscious of his spiritual nature and is 
engaged in Kr�?Qa consciousness, or the devotional service of the Lord, has 
activities which are called transcendental. Such activities are performed in 
his constitutional position, and they are technically called devotional ser­
vice. Now, in the conditioned state, sometimes devotional service and the 
conditional service m relation to the body will parallel one another. But 
then again, sometimes these activities become opposed to one another. As 
far as possible, a devotee is very cautious so that he does not do anything 
that could disrupt his wholesome condition. He knows that perfection in 
his activities depends on his progressive realization of Kr�?Qa consciousness. 
Sometimes, however, it may be seen that a person in Krf?Qa consciousness 
commits some act which may be taken as most abominable socially or 
politically. But such a temporary falldown does not disqualify him. In the 
Srimad-Bhiigavatam it is stated that if a person falls down, but is whole­
heartedly engaged in the transcendental service of the Supreme Lord, the 
Lord, being situated within his heart, beautifies him and excuses him from 
that abomination. The material contamination is so strong that even a yogi 
fully engaged in the service of the Lord sometimes becomes ensnared; but 
Kr�?Qa consciousness is so strong that such an occasional falldown is at 
once rectified. Therefore the process of devotional service is always a 
success. No one should deride a devotee for some accidental falldown 
from the ideal path, for, as is explained in the next verse, such occasional 
falldowns will be stopped in due course, as soon as a devotee is completely 
situated in Kr�Qa consciousness. 
Therefore a person who is situated in Kn;Qa consciousness and is engaged 
with determination in the process of chanting Hare Kr�Qa, Hare Kr�Qa, 
Kr�1.1a Kr�Qa, Hare Hare/Hare Rama, Hare Rama, Rama Rama, Hare Hare 
should be considered to be in the transcendental position, even if by 
chance or accident he is found to have fallen. The words siidhur eva, "he is 
saintly," are very emphatic. They are a warning to the nondevotees that 
because of an accidental falldown a devotee should not he derided; he 
should still he considered saintly even if he has fallen down accidentally. 
And the word mantavya[l is still more emphatic. If one does not follow 
Text 31] 
The Most Confidential Knowledge 
485. 
this rule, and derides a devotee for his accidental falldown, then he is 
disobeying the order of the Supreme Lord. The only qualification of a 
devotee is to be unflinchingly and exclusively engaged in devotional 
service. 
The mark of a spot which may be seen on th� moon does not become 
an impediment to the moonlight. Similarly, the accidental falldown of a 
devotee from the path of a saintly character does not make him abomin­
able. On the other hand, one should not misunderstand that a devotee in 
transcendental devotional service can act in all kinds of abominable ways; 
this verse only refers to an accident due to the strong power of material 
connections. Devotional service is more or less a declaration of war against 
the illusory energy. As long as one is not strong enough to fight the 
illusory energy, there may be accidental falldowns. But when one is stro�g 
enough, he is no longer subjected to such falldowns, as previously ex­
plained. No one should take advantage of this verse and commit nonsense 
and think that he is still a devotee. If he does not improve in his character 
by devotional service, then it is to be understood that he is not a high 
devotee.

This should not be misunderstood. In the Seventh Chapter the Lord 
says that one who is engaged in mischievous activities cannot become a 
486 
Bhagavad-gita As It Is 
[Ch. 9 
devotee of the Lord. One who is not a devotee of the Lord has no good 
qualifications whatsoever. The question remains, then, how can a person 
engaged in abominable activities-either by accident or intention-be a 
pure devotee? This question may justly be raised. The miscreants, as stated 
in the Seventh Chapter, who never come to the devotional service of the 
Lord, have no good qualifications, as is stated in the Srimad-Bhiigavatam. 
Generally, a devotee who is engaged in the nine kinds of devotional activi­
ties is engaged in the process of cleansing all material contamination from 
the heart. He puts the Supreme Personality of Godhead within his heart, 
and all sinful contaminations are naturally washed away. Continuous 
thinking of the Supreme Lord makes him pure by nature. According to the 
Vedas, there is a certain regulation that if one falls down from his exalted 
position, he has to undergo certain ritualistic processes to purify himself. 
But here there is no such condition because the purifying process is 
already there in the heart of the devotee, due to his remembering the 
Supreme Personality of Godhead constantly. Therefore, the chanting of 
Hare Kr�J).a, Hare Kr�J).a, Kr�J).a Kr�J).a, Hare Hare/ Hare Rama, Hare Rama, 
Rama Rama, Hare Hare should be continued without stoppage. This will 
protect a devotee from all accidental falldowns. He will thus remain 
perpetually free from all material contaminations.

PURPORT 
It is clearly declared here by the Supreme Lord that in devotional ser­
vice there is no distinction between the lower or higher classes of people. 
In the material conception of life, there are such divisions, but for a person 
engaged in transcendental devotional service to the Lord, there are not. 
Everyone is eligible for the supreme destination. In the Srimad-Bhiigavatam 
it is stated that even the lowest, who are called cart{iiilas (dog-eaters), can 
be elevated by association with a pure devotee. Therefore devotional 
service and guidance of a pure devotee are so strong that there is no dis­
crimination between the lower and higher classes of men; anyone can take 
to it. The most simple man taking center of the pure devotee can be puri­
fied by proper guidance. According to the different modes of material 
nature, men are classified in the mode of goodness (briihmartas), the mode 
of passion (k�atriyas, or administrators), the mixed modes of passion and 
ignorance (vaisyas, or merchants), and the mode of ignorance (siidras, or 
workers). Those lower than them are called cart{iiilas, and they are born in 
sinful families. Generally, those who are born in sinful families are not 
accepted by the higher classes. But the process of devotional service and 
the pure devotee of the Supreme God are so strong that all the lower 
classes can attain the highest perfection of life. This is possible only when 
one takes center of Kr�r;ta. One has to take center completely of Kr�r;ta. 
Then one can become much greater than great jniinis and yogis.

How much greater then are the brahma!las, the righteous, the devotees 
and saintly kings who in this temporary miserable world engage in loving 
service unto Me. 
PURPORT 
In this material world there are classifications of people, but, after all, 
this world is not a happy place for anyone. It is clearly stated here, 
anityam asuhharh lokam: this world is temporary andfull of miseries, not 
habitable for any sane gentleman. This world is declared by the Supreme 
Personality of Godhead to be temporary and full of miseries. Some of the 
philosophers, especially the minor philosophers, say that this world is 
false, but we can understand from Bhagavad-gitii that the world is not false; 
it is temporary. There is a difference between temporary and false. This 
world is temporary, but there is another world which is eternal. This world 
is miserable, but the other world is eternal and blissful. 
Arjuna was born in a saintly royal family. To him also the Lord says, 
"Take to My devotional service and come quickly back to Godhead, back 
home." No one should remain in this temporary world, full as it is .with 
miseries. Everyone should attach himself to the bosom of the Supreme 
Personality of Godhead so that he can be eternally happy. The devotional 
service of the Supreme Lord is the only process by which all problems of 
all classes of men can be solved. Everyone should therefore take to Kr�l).a 
consciousness and make his life perfect.

PURPORT 
In this verse it is clearly indicated that Kr�J)a consciousness is the only 
means of being delivered from the clutches of this contaminated material 
world. Sometimes unscrupulous commentators distort the meaning of what 
is clearly stated here: that all devotional service should be offered to the 
Supreme Personality of Godhead, Kr�J)a. Unfortunately, unscrupulous 
commentators divert the mind of the reader to that which is not at all 
feasible. Such commentators do not know that there is no difference be­
tween Kr�J)a's mind and Kr�J)a. Kr�J)a is not an ordinary human being; He 
is Absolute Truth. His body, mind and He Himself are one and absolute. 
It is stated in the Kurma Puriira, as it is quoted by Bhaktisiddhanta 
Sarasvati Gosvami in his Anubhii�ya comments on Caitanya-caritiimrta, 
Fifth Chapter, A.di-lilii, verses 41-48, "deha-dehi-vibhedo'yam nesvare 
vidyate kvacit," which means that there is no difference in Kr�J)a, the 
Supreme Lord, between Himself and His body. But, because they do not 
know this science of Kr�!J.a, the commentators hide Kr�!la and divide His 
personality from His mind or from His body. Although this. is sheer 
ignorance of the science of Kr�!J.a, some men make profit out of mis­
leading the people. 
There are some who are demonic; they also think of Kr�J)a, but envious­
ly, just like King Kamsa, Kr�J)a's uncle. He was also thinking of Kr�J)a 
always, but he thought of Kr�J)a as his enemy. He was always in anxiety, 
wondering when Kr�J)a would come to kill him. That kind of thinking will 
not help us. One should be thinking of Kr�J)a in devotional love. That is 
bhakti. One should cultivate the knowledge of Kr�va continually. What is 
that favorable cultivation? It is to learn from a bona fide teacher. Kr�J)a is 
the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and we have several times explained 
that His body is not material, but is eternal, blissful knowledge. This kind 
of talk about Kr�J)a will help one become a devotee. Otherwise, under­
standing Kr�J)a from the wrong source will prove fruitless. 
One should therefore engage his mind in the eternal form, the primal 
form of Kr�J)a; with conviction in his heart that Kr�J)a is the Supreme, he 
should engage himself in worship. There are hundreds of thousands of 
temples in India for the worship of Kr�J)a, and devotional service is prac­
ticed there. When such practice is made, one has to offer obeisances to 
--� 
490 
Bhagavad-gita As It Is 
[Ch. 9 
Kr�l).a. One should lower his head before the Deity and engage his mind, 
his body, his activities-everything. That will make one fully absorbed in 
Kr�l).a without deviation. This will help one transfer into the Kr�l).aloka. 
One should not be deviated by unscrupulous commentators. One must 
engage in the nine different processes of devotional service, beginning with 
hearing and chanting about Kr�Qa. Pure devotional service is the highest 
achievement of human society. 
In the Seventh and Eighth Chapters of Bhagavad-gitii, pure devotional 
service to the Lord has been explained, apart from the yoga of knowledge 
and mystic yoga or fruitive activities. Those who are not purely sanctified 
may be attracted by different features of the Lord, like the impersonal 
brahmajyoti and localized Paramatma, but a pure devotee directly takes 
to the service of the Supreme Lord. 
There is a beautiful poem about Kr�Qa in which it is clearly stated that 
any person who is engaged in the worship of demigods is most unintelligent 
and cannot achieve at any time the supreme award of Kr�Qa. The devotee, 
in the beginning, may sometimes fall from the standard, but still he should 
be considered superior to all other philosophers and yogis. One who always 
engages in Kr�D-a consciousness should be understood to be the perfect 
saintly person. His accidental nondevotional activities will diminish, and he 
will soon be situated without any doubt in complete perfection. The pure 
devotee has no actual chance to fall down because the Supreme Godhead 
personally takes care of His pure devotees. Therefore, the intelligent person 
should take directly to this process of Kr�Qa consciousness and happily 
live in this material world. He will eventually receive the supreme award of 
Kr�Qa. 
Thus end the Bhaktivedanta Purports to the Ninth Chapter of the 
Srimad-Bhagavad-gita in the matter of the Most Confidential Knowledge.

TRANSLATION 
The Supreme Lord said: My dear friend, mighty-armed Arjuna, listen 
again to My supreme word, which I shall impart to you for your benefit 
and which will give you great joy. 
PURPORT 
The word paramam is explained thus by Parasara Muni: one who is full 
in six opulences, who has full strength, full fame, wealth, knowledge, 
beauty and renunciation, is paramam, or the Supreme Personality of 
Godhead. While Krwa was present on this earth, He displayed all six 
opulences. Therefore great sages like Parasara .Muni have all accepted 
Kr�J).a as the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Now Kr�J).a is instructing 
Arjuna in more confidential knowledge of His opulences and His work. 
Previously, beginning with the Seventh Chapter, the Lord already explained 
His different energies and how they are acting. Now in this chapter He 
explains His specific opulences to Arjuna. In the previous chapter he has 
clearly explained His different energies to establish devotion in firm con­
viction. Again in this chapter He tells Arjuna about His manifestations and 
various opulences. 
The more one hears about the Supreme God, the more one becomes 
fixed in devotional service. One should always hear about the Lord in the 
association of devotees; that will enhance one's devotional service. Dis­
courses in the society of devotees can take place only among those who 
are really anxious to be in Kr�J).a consciousness. Others cannot take part in 
such discourses. The Lord clearly tells Arjuna that because he is very dear 
to Him, for his benefit such discourses are taking place.

TRANSLATION 
Neither the hosts of demigods nor the great sages know My origin, for, 
in every respect, I am the source of the demigods and the sages. 
PURPORT 
As stated in the Brahma-sarhhitii, Lord Kr�J)a is the Supreme Lord. No 
one is greater than Him; He is the cause of all causes. Here it is also stated 
by the Lord personally that He is the cause of all the demigods and sages. 
Even the demigods and great sages cannot understand Kr�J)a; they can 
understand neither His name nor His personality, so what is the position 
of the so-called scholars of this tiny planet? No one can understand why 
this Supreme God comes to earth as an ordinary human being and executes 
such commonplace and yet wonderful activities. One should know, then, 
that scholarship is not the qualification necessary to understand Kr�J)a. 
Even the demigods and the great sages have tried to understand Kr�J)a by 
their mental speculation, and they have failed to do so. In the Srimad­
Bhiigavatam also it is clearly said that even the great demigods are not able 
to understand the Supreme Personality of Godhead. They can speculate to 
the limits of their imperfect senses and can reach the opposite conclusion 
of impersonalism, of something not manifested by the three qualities of 
material nature, or they can imagine something by mental speculation, 
but it is not possible to understand Kr�J)a by such foolish speculation. 
Here the Lord indirectly says that if anyone wants to know the Absolute 
Truth, "Here I am present as the Supreme Personality of Godhead. I am 
the Supreme." One should know this. Although one cannot understand the 
inconceivable Lord who is personally present, He nonetheless exists. We 
can actually understand Kr�J)a, who is eternal, full of bliss and knowledge, 
simply by studying His words in Bhagavad-gitii and Srimad-Bhiigavatam. 
The impersonal Brahman can be conceived by persons who are already in 
the inferior energy of the Lord, but the Personality of Godhead cannot be 
conceived unless one is in the transcendental position. 
Because most men cannot understand Kr�J)a in His actual situation, out 
of His causeless mercy He descends to show favor to such speculators. Yet 
I� 
I 
494 
Bhagavad-glta As It Is 
[Ch. 10. 
despite the Supreme Lord's uncommon activities, these speculators, due 
to contamination in the material energy, still think that the impersonal 
Brahman is the Supreme. Only the devotees who are fully surrendered 
unto the Supreme Lord can understand, by the grace of the Supreme 
Personality, that He is Kr�Q.a. The devotees of the Lord do not bother 
about the _impersonal Brahman conception of God; their faith and devotion 
bring them to surrender immediately unto the Supreme Lord, and out of 
the causeless mercy of Kr�Q.a, they can understand Kr�Q.a. No one else can 
understand Him. So even great sages agree: What is iitmii, what is the 
Supreme? It is He whom we have to worship.

PURPORT 
As stated in the Seventh Chapter, those who are trying to elevate them­
selves to the platform of spiritual realization are not ordinary men. They 
are superior to millions and millions of ordinary men who have no know­
ledge of spiritual realization, but out of those actually trying to understand 
their spiritual situation, one who can come to the understanding that Kr�l}a 
is the Supreme Personality of Godhead, the proprietor of everything, the 
Text 3 J 
The Opulence of the Absolute 
495 
unborn, is the most successful spiritually realized person. In that stage 
only, when one has fully understood Kr�va's supreme position, can one be 
free completely from all sinful reactions. 
Here the word ajam, meaning unborn, should not be confused with the 
living entities, who are described in the Second Chapter as ajam. The Lord 
is different from the living entities who are taking birth and dying due to 
material attachment. The conditional souls are changing their bodies, but 
His body is not changeable. Even when He comes to this material world, 
He comes as the same unborn; therefore in the Fourth Chapter it is said 
that the Lord, by His internal potency, is not under the inferior material 
energy, but is always in the superior energy. 
He was existing before the creation, and He is different from His 
creation. All the demigods were created within this material world, but as 
far as Kr�va is concerned, it is said that He is not created; therefore Kr�va 
is different even from the great demigods like Brahma and Siva. And 
because He is the creator of Brahma, Siva and all the other demigods, He is 
the Supreme Person of all planets. 
Sri Kr�va is therefore different from everything that is created, and 
anyone who knows Him as such immediately becomes liberated from all 
sinful reaction. One must be liberated from all sinful activities to be in the 
knowledge of the Supreme Lord. Only by devotional service can He be 
known and not by any other means, as stated in Bhagavad-gitii. 
One should not try to understand Kr�va as a human being. As stated 
previously, only a foolish person thinks Him to be a human being. This is 
again expressed here in a different way. A man who is not foolish, who is 
intelligent enough to understand the constitutional position of the God­
head, is always free from all sinful reactions. 
If Kr�va is known as the son of Devakl, then how can He be unborn? 
That is also explained in Srimad-Bhiigavatam: When He appeared before 
Devakl and Vasudeva, He was not born as an ordinary child; He appeared 
in His original form, and then He transformed Himself into an ordinary 
child. 
Anything done under the direction of Kr�va is transcendental. It cannot 
be contaminated by the material reactions, which may be auspicious or 
inauspicious. The conception that there are things auspicious and inaus­
picious in the material world is more or less a mental concoction because 
there is nothing auspicious in the material world. Everything is inauspi­
cious because the very material mask.is inauspicious. We simply imagine it 
to be auspicious. Real auspiciousness depends on activities in Kr�va con­
sciousness in full devotion and service. Therefore if we at all want our 
' 
f . 
. ' 
I 
496 
Bhagavad-glta As It Is 
[Ch. 10 
activities to be auspicious, then we should work und€r the directions of 
the Supreme Lord. Such directions
' 
are given in authoritative scriptures 
such as Srimad-Bhiigavatam and Bhagavad-gitii, or from a bona fide spiritual 
master. Because the spiritual master is the representative of the Supreme 
Lord, his direction is directly the direction of the Supreme Lord. The 
spiritual master, saintly persons and scriptures direct in the same way. 
There is no contradiction in these three sources. All actions done under 
such direction are free from the reactions of pious or impious activities of 
this material world. The transcendental attitude of the devotee in the 
performance of activities is actually that of renunciation, and this is called 
sannyiisa. Anyone acting under the direction of the Supreme Lord is 
actually a sannyiisi and a yogi, and not the man who has simply taken the 
dress of the sannyiisi, or a pseudo-yogi.

truthfulness, self-control and calmness, pleasure and pain, birth, death, 
fear, fearlessness, nonviolence, equanimity, satisfaction, austerity, charity, 
fame and infamy are created by Me alone. 
PURPORT 
The different qualities of living entities, be they good or bad, are all 
created by Kr�Q.a, and they are described here. 
Intelligence refers to the power of analyzing things in proper perspec­
tive, and knowledge refers to understanding what is spirit and what is 
matter. Ordinary knowledge obtained by a university education pertains 
only to matter, and it is not accepted here as knowledge. Knowledge means 
knowing the distinction between spirit and matter. In modern education 
there is no knowledge about the spirit; they are simply taking care of the 
material elements and bodily needs. Therefore academic knowledge is not 
complete. 
Asammoha[l., freedom from doubt and delusion, can be achieved when 
one is not hesitant and when he understands the transcendental philosophy. 
Slowly but surely he becomes free from bewilderment. Nothing should be 
accepted blindly; everything should be accepted with care and with 
caution. K�amii, forgiveness, should be practiced, and one should excuse 
the minor offenses of others. Satyam, truthfulness, means that facts 
should be presented as they are for the benefit of others. Facts should not 
be misrepresented. According to social conventions, it is said that one can 
speak the truth only when it is palatable to others. But that is not truth­
fulness. The truth should be spoken in a straight and forward way, so that 
others will understand actually what the facts are. If a man is a thief and if 
people are warned that he is a thief, that is truth. Although sometimes the 
truth is unpalatable, one should not refrain from speaking it. Truthfulness 
demands that the facts be presented as they are for the benefit of others. 
That is the definition of truth. 
Self-control means that the senses should not be used for unnecessary 
personal enjoyment. There is no prohibition against meeting the proper 
needs of the senses. but unnecessary sense eiljoyment is detrimental for 
498 
Bhagavad-gita As It Is 
[Ch. 10 
spiritual advancement. Therefore the senses should be restrained from 
unnecessary use. Similarly, the mind should not indulge in unnecessary 
thoughts; that is called samafl, or calmness. Nor should one spend one's 
time pondering over earning money. That is a misuse of the thinking power. 
The mind should be used to understand the prime necessity of human 
beings, and that should be presented authoritatively. The power of thought 
should be developed in association with persons who are authorities in the 
scriptures, saintly persons and spiritual masters and those whose thinking 
is highly developed. Sukham, pleasure or happiness, should always be in 
that which is favorable for the cultivation of the spiritual knowledge of 
Kw).a consciousness. And similarly, that which is painful or which causes 
distress is that which is unfavorable for the cultivation of Kr�l).a conscious­
ness. Anything favorable for the development of Kr�l).a consciousness 
should be accepted, and anything unfavorable should be rejected. 
Bhava, birth, should be understood to refer to the body. As far as the 
soul is concerned, there is neither birth nor death; that we have discussed 
in the beginning of Bhagavad-gitii. Birth and death apply to one's embodi­
ment in the material world. Fear is due to worrying about the future. A 
person in Kr�l).a consciousness has no fear because by his activities he is 
sure to go back to the spiritual sky, back home, back to Godhead. There­
fore his future is very bright. Others, however, do not know what their 
future holds; they have no knowledge of what the next life holds. So they 
are therefore in constant anxiety. If we want to get free from anxiety, 
then the best course is to understand Kp;;l).a and be situated always in 
Krwa consciousness. In that way we will be free from all fear. In the 
Srimad-Bhiigavatam it is stated that fear is caused by our absorption in the 
illusory energy, but those who are free from the illusory energy, those who 
are confident that they are not the material body, that they are spiritual 
parts of the Supreme Personality of Godhead and are therefore engaged in 
the transcendental service of the Supreme Godhead, have nothing to fear. 
Their future is very bright. This fear is a condition of persons who are not 
in Kr�l).a consciousness. Bhayam, fearlessness, is 0nly possible for one in 
Kr�l).a consciousness • 
. Ahimsii, nonViolence, means that one should not do anything which 
will put others into misery or confusion. Material activities that are 
promised by so many ,foliticians, sociologists, philanthropists, etc., do not 
produce very good results because the politicians and philanthropists have 
no transcendental vision; they do not know what is actually beneficial for 
human society. Ahimsii means that people should be trained in such a way 
that the full utilization of the human body can be achieved. The human 
Texts 4-5] 
The Opulence of the Absolute 
499 
body is meant for spiritual realization, so any movement or any commis­
sions which do not further that end commit violence on the human body. 
That which furthers the future spiritual happiness of the people in general 
is called nonviolence. 
Samatii, equanimity, refers to freedom from attachment and aversion. 
To be very much attached or to be very much detached is not the best. 
This material world should be accepted without attachment or aversion. 
Similarly, that which is favorable for prosecuti!'lg Knn;a consciousness 
should be accepted; that which is unfavorable should be rejected. That is 
called samatii, equanimity. A person in Knl).a consciousness has nothing to 
reject and nothing to accept unless it is useful in the prosecution of Kr�l).a 
consciOusness. 
Tu§ti{l,, satisfaction, means that one should not be eager to gather more 
and more material goods by unnecessary activity. One should be satisfied 
with whatever is obtained by the grace of the Supreme Lord; that is called 
satisfaction. Tapas means austerity or penance. There are many rules and 
definitions in the Vedas which apply here, like rising early in the morning 
and taking a bath. Sometimes it is very troublesome to rise early in the 
morning, but whatever voluntary trouble one may suffer in this way is 
called penance. Similarly, there are prescriptions for fasting on certain days 
of the month. One may not be inclined to practice such fasting, but be­
cause of his determination to make advancement in the science of Kr�l).a 
consciousness, he should accept such bodily troubles which are recom­
mended. However, one should not fast unnecessarily or against Vedic 
injunctions. One shouW not fast for some political purpose; that is de­
scribed in Bhagavad-gitii as fasting in ignorance, and anything done in 
ignorance or passion does not lead to spiritual advancement. Everything 
done in the mode of goodness does advance one, however, and fasting 
done in terms of the Vedic injunctions enriches one in spiritual know­
ledge. 
As far as charity is concerned, one should give fifty percent of his 
earnings to some good cause. And what is a good cause? It is that which is 
conducted in terms of Kr�l).a consciousness. That is not only a good cause, 
but it is the best cause. Because Kr�l).a is good, His cause is also good. Thus 
charity should be given to a person who is engaged in K�l).a consciousness. 
According to Vedic literature, it is enjoined that charity should be given to 
the briihmap.as. This practice is still followed, although not very nicely in 
terms of the Vedic injunction. But still the injunction is that charity should 
be given to the briihmap.as. Why? Because they are engaged in higher culti­
vation of spiritual knowledge. A b riihmap.a is supposed to devote his whole 
500 
Bhagavad-gita As It Is 
[Ch. 10 
life to understanding Brahman. A brahma-jana is one who knows Brahman; 
he is called a briihmar-a. Thus charity is offered to the briihmar-as because 
since they are always engaged in higher spiritual service, they have no time 
to earn their livelihood. In the Vedic literature, charity is also to be awarded 
to the renouncer of life, the sannyiisi. The sannyii.�is beg from door to 
door, not for money but for missionary purposes. The system is that they 
go from door to door to awaken the householders from the slumber of 
ignorance. Because the householders are engaged in family affairs and 
have forgotten their actual purpose in life-awakening their Kr�J;J.a con­
sciousness-it is the business of the sannyiisis to go as beggars to the house­
holders and encourage them to be Kr�J;J.a conscious. As it is said in the 
Vedas, one should awake and achieve what is due him in this human form 
of life. This knowledge and method is distributed by the sannyiisis; hence 
charity is to be given to the renouncer of life, to the briihmar-as, and simi­
lar good causes, not to any whimsical cau�e. 
Y a5a�, fame, should be according to Lord Caitanya, who said that a man 
is famous when he is known as a great devotee. That is real fame. If one 
has become a great man in Kr�Q.a consciousness and it is known, then he is 
truly famous. One who does not have such fame is infamous. 
All these qualities are manifest throughout the universe in human society 
and in the society of the demigods. There are many forms of humanity on 
other planets, and these qualities are there. Now, for one who wants to 
advance in Kr�J;J.a consciousness, Kr�J;J.a creates ail these qualities, but the 
person develops them himself from within. One who engages in the devo­
tional service of the Supreme Lord develops all the good qualities, as 
arranged by the Supreme Lord. 
Of whatever we find, good or bad, the origin is Kr�J;J.a. Nothing can 
manifest in this material world which is not in Kr�J;J.a. That is knowledge; 
although we know that things are differently situated, we should realize 
that everything flows from Kr�J;J.a.

TRANSLATIO� 
The seven great sages and before them the four other great sages and 
the Manus [progenitors of mankind) are born out of My mind, and all 
creatures in these planets descend from them. 
PURPORT 
The Lord is giving a genealogical synopsis of the universal population. 
Brahma is the original creature born out of the energy of the Supreme 
Lord known as Hiral).yagarbha. And from Brahma all the seven great 
sages, and before them four other great sages, named Sanaka, Sananda, 
Sanatana, and Sanatkumara, and the Manus, are manifest. All these 
twenty-five great sages are known as the patriarchs of the living entities 
all over the universe. There are innumerable universes and innumerable 
planets within each universe, and each planet is full of population of dif­
ferent varieties. All of them are born of these twenty-five patriarchs. 
Brahma underwent penance for one thousand years of the demigod� be­
fore he realized by the grace of Kr�l).a how to create. Then from Brahma, 
Sanaka, Sananda, Sanatana, and Sanatkumara came out, then Rudra, and 
then the seven sages, and in this way all the briihmartas and k§atriyas are 
born out of the energy of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Brahma 
is known as pitiimaha, the grandfather, and Kr�l).a is known as the prapitii· 
maha, the father of the grandfather. That is stated in the Eleventh Chapter 
of the Bhagavad-gitii. (Bg. 11.39)

TRANSLATION 
He who knows in truth this glory and power of Mine engages in un­
alloyed devotional service; of this there is no doubt. 
PURPORT 
The highest summit of spiritual perfection is knowledge of the Supreme 
Personality of Godhead. Unless one is firmly convinced of the different 
opulences of the Supreme Lord, he cannot engage in devotional service. 
Generally people know that God is great, but they do not know in detail 
how God is great. Here are the details. If one knows factually how God is 
great, then naturally he becomes a surrendered soul and engages himself 
in the devotional service of the Lord. When one factually knows the opu­
lences of the Supreme, there is no alternative but to surrender to Him. 
This factual knowledge can be known from the descriptions in Srimad­
Bhiigavatam and Bhagavad-gitii and similar literatures. 
In the administration of this universe there are many demigods distrib­
uted throughout the planetary system, and the chief of them are Brahma, 
Lord Siva and the four great Kumaras and other patriarchs. There are 
many forefathers of the population of the universe, and all of them are 
born of the Supreme Lord Kr�va. The Supreme Personality of Godhead, 
Kr�va, is the original forefather of all forefathers. 
These are some of the opulences of the Supreme Lord. When one is 
firmly convinced of them, he accepts Kr�va with great faith and without 
any doubt, and he engages in devotional service. All this particular know­
ledge is required in order to increase one's interest in the loving devotional 
service of the Lord. One should not neglect to understand fully how great 
Kr�va is, for by knowing the greatness of Kr�va one will be able to be fixed 
in sincere devotional service.

I am the source of all spiritual and material worlds. Everything emanates 
from Me. The wise who know this perfectly engage in My devotional 
service and worship Me with all their hearts. 
PURPORT 
A learned scholar who has studied the Vedas perfectly and has informa­
tion from authorities like Lord Caitanya and who knows how to apply 
these teachings can understand that Kr�Q.a is the origin of everything in 
both the material and spiritual worlds, and because he knows this perfect­
ly he becomes firmly fixed in the devotional service of the Supreme Lord. 
He can never be deviated by any amount of nonsensical commentaries or 
by fools. All Vedic literature agrees that Kr�Q.a is the source of Brahma, 
Siva and all other demigods. In the A tharva-veda it is said, "yo brahmiipam 
vidadhiiti: pfirvam yo vai vediims ca giipayati sma kr§pa{l." "It was Kr�Q.a 
who in the beginning instructed Brahma in Vedic knowledge and who 
disseminated Vedic knowledge in the past." Then again it is said, "atha 
puru§O ha vai niiriiyapo 'kiimayata prajii{l srjeya ity upakramya." "Then 
the Supreme Personality NarayaQ.a desired to create living entities." Again 
it is said: 
niiriiyapiid brahmii jiiyate, niiriiyapiid prajiipati[l prajiiyate, niiriiyapiid 
indro jiiyate, niiriiyapiid a§tau vasuvo jiiyante, niiriiyapiid ekiidasa 
rudrii jiiyante, niiriiyapiid dviidasiidityii{l. 
"From Naraya!J.a , Brahma is born, and from Naraya!J.a, the patriarchs are also 
born. F rom Naraya:r;ta, lndra is born, from Naraya:r;ta the eight V asus are 
born, from Naraya:t;ta the eleven Rudras are born, from Naraya:t;ta the 
twelve Adityas are born.'' 
504 
Bhagavad-gita As It Is 
[Ch. 10 
It is said in the same Vedas: brahmarzyo devaki-putral): "The son of 
Devaki, Knn;ta, is the Supreme Personality." Then it is said: 
eko vai niiriiyqrza iisin na brahmii na isiino niipo niigni samau neme 
dyiiv-iiprthivi na nak§atriirzi na siiryal) sa ekiiki na ramate tasya 
dhyiiniintal) sthasya yatra chiindogail) kriyamiirzii§takiidi-sarhjiiakii

"In the beginning of the creation there was only the Supreme Personality 
Narayal).a. There was no Brahma, no Siva, no fire, no moon, no stars in the 
sky, no sun. There was only Kr�l).a, who creates all and enjoys all." 
In the many Puriirzas it is said that Lord Siva was born from the highest, 
the Supreme Lord Kr�l).a, and the Vedas say that it is the Supreme Lord, 
the creator of Brahma and Siva, who is to be worshiped. In the Mok§a­
dharma Kr�l).a also says,prajiipatirh ca rudram ciipy aham eva srjiimi vai tau 
hi miirh na 
vijiinito mama miiyii-vimohitau. "The patriarchs, Siva and 
others are created by Me, though they do not know that they are created 
by Me because they are deluded by My illusory energy." In Variiha Puriirza 
it is also ·said, niiriiyarzal) paro devas tasmiij jiitas caturmukhal) tasmiid 
rudro 'bhavad deval) sa ca sarvajiiatiim gatal). "Narayal).a is the Supreme 
Personality of Godhead, and from Him Brahma was born, from whom Siva 
was born." 
Lord Kr�l).a is the source of all generations, and He is called the most 
efficient cause of everything. He says that because "everything is born of 
Me, I am the original source of all. Everything is under Me; no one is above 
Me." There is no supreme controller other than Kr�l).a. One who under­
stands Kr�l).a in such a way from a bona fide spiritual master and from 
Vedic literature, who engages all his energy in Kr�l).a consciousness, be­
comes a truly learned man. In comparison to him, all others, who do not 
know Kr�l).a properly, are but fools. Only a fool would consider Kr�l).a to 
be an ordinary man. A Kr�l).a conscious person should not be bewildered 
by fools; he should avoid all unauthorized commentaries and intt"rpreta­
tions on Bhagavad-gitii and proceed in Kr�l).a consciousness with determina­
tion and firmness.

TRANSLATION 
The thoughts of My pure devotees dwell in Me, their lives are surrendered 
to Me, and they derive great satisfaction and bliss enlightening one another 
and conversing about Me. 
PURPORT 
Pure devotees, whot;e characteristics are mentioned here, engage them­
selves fully in the transcendental loving service of the Lord. Their minds 
cannot be diverted from the lotus feet of Kr�J)a. Their talks are solely on 
the transcendental subjects. The symptoms of the pure devotees are 
described in this verse specifically. Devotees of the Supreme Lord are 
twenty-four hours daily engaged in glorifying the pastimes of the Supreme 
Lord. Their hearts and souls are constantly submerged in Kr�J)a, and they 
take pleasure in discussing Him with other devotees. 
In the preliminary stage of devotional service they relish the transcen­
dental pleasure from the service itself, and in the mature stage they are 
actually situated in love of God. Once situated in that transcendental 
position, they can relish the highest perfection which is exhibited by the 
Lord in His abode. Lord Caitanya likens transcendental devotional service 
to the sowing of a seed in the heart of the living entity. There are innumer­
able living entities traveling throughout the different planets of the uni­
verse, and out of them there are a few who are fortunate enough to meet 
a pure devotee and get the chance to understand devotional service. This 
devotional service is just like a seed, and if it is sown in the heart of a 
living entity, and if he goes on hearing and chanting, Hare Kr�J)a, Hare 
Kr�J)a, Kr�J)a Kr�J)a, Hare Hare/ Hare Rama, Hare Rama, Rama Rama, 
Hare Hare, that seed fructifies, just as the seed of a tree fructifies with 
··:"'1

506 
Bhagavad-g]ta As It Is 
[Ch. 10 
regular watering. The spiritual plant of devotional service gradually grows 
and grows until it penetrates the covering of the material universe and 
enters into the brahmajyoti effulgence in the spiritual sky. In the spiritual 
sky also that plant grows more and more until it reaches the highest planet, 
which is called Goloka Vrndavana, the supreme planet of Kr�l).a. Ultimate­
ly, the plant takes shelter under the lotus feet of Kr�l).a and rests there. 
Gradually, as a plant grows fruits and flowers, that plant of devotional 
service also produces fruits, and the watering process in the form of chant­
ing and hearing goes on. This plant of devotional service is fully described 
in the Caitanya-caritiimrta. It is explained there that when the complete 
plant takes shelter under the lotus feet of the Supreme Lord, one becomes 
fully absorbed in love of God; then he cannot live even for a moment with­
out being in contact with the Supreme Lord, just as a fish cannot live with­
out water. In such a state, the devotee actually attains the transcendental 
qualities in contact with the Supreme Lord. 
The Srimad-Bhiigavatam is also full of such narration about the relation­
ship between the Supreme Lord and His devotees; therefore the Srimad­
Bhiigavatam is very dear to the devotees. In this narration there is nothing 
about 
material 
activities, 
sense 
gratification or liberation. Srimad­
Bhiigavatam is the only narration in which the transcendental nature of 
the Supreme Lord and His devotees is fully described. Thus the realized 
souls in Kr�l).a consciousness take continual pleasure in hearing such tran­
scendental literatures, just as a young boy and girl take pleasure in associa­
tion.

TRANSLATION 
To those who are constantly, devoted and worship Me with love, I give 
the understanding by which they can come to Me. 
PURPORT 
In this verse the word buddhi-yogam is very significant. We may remem· 
her that in the Second Chapter the Lord, instructing Arjuna, said that He 
had spoken to him of many things and that He would instruct him in the 
way of buddhi-yoga. Now buddhi-yoga is explained. Buddhi-yogam itself 
is action in Kr§l)a consciousness; that is the highest intelligence. Budd hi 
means intelligence, and yogam means mystic activities or mystic elevation. 
When one tries to go back home, back to Godhead, and takes fully to 
Kr�l)a consciousness in devotional service, his action is called buddhi­
yogam. In other words, buddhi-yogam is the process by which one gets out 
of the entanglement of this material world. The ultimate goal of progress 
is Kr�l)a. People do not know this; therefore the association of devotees 
and a bona fide spiritual master are important. One should know that the 
goal is Kr�l)a, and when the goal is assigned, then the path is slowly but 
progressively traversed, and the ultimate goal is achieved. 
When a person knows the goal of life but is addicted to the fruits of 
activities, he is acting in karma-yoga. When he knows that the goal is 
Kr�l)a, but he takes pleasure in mental speculations to understand Kr§l)a, 
he is acting in jniina-yoga. And when he knows the goal and seeks Kr�l)a 
completely in Kr�l)a consciousness and devotional service, he is acting in 
bhakti-yoga, or buddhi-yoga, which is the complete yoga. This complete 
yoga is the highest perfectional stage of life. 
A person may have a bona fide spiritual master and may be attached to 
a spiritual organization, but still, if he is not intelligent enough to make 
progress, then Kr�l)a from within gives him instructions so that he may 
ultimately come to Him without difficulty. The qualification is that a 
person always engage himself in Kr�l)a consciousness and with love and 
devotion render all kinds of services. He should perform some sort of work 
for Kr�l)a, and that work should be with love. If a devotee is intelligent 
enough, he will make progress on the path of self-realization. If one is 
sincere and devoted to the activities of devotional service, the Lord gives 
him a chance to make progress and ultimately attain to Him.

PURPORT 
When Lord Caitanya was in Benares promulgating the chanting of Hare 
Kr�lJ.a, Hare Kr�lJ.a, Kr�lJ.a Kr�lJ.a, Hare Hare/ Hare Rama, Hare Rama, Rama 
Rama, Hare Hare, thousands of people were following Him. Prakasananda, 
a very influential and learned scholar in Benares at that time, derided 
Lord Caitanya for being a sentimentalist. Sometimes philosophers criticize 
the devotees because they think that most of the devotees are in the dark­
ness of ignorance and are philosophically naive sentimentalists. Actually 
that is not the fact. There are very, very learned scholars who have put 
forward the philosophy of devotion, but even if a devotee does not take 
advantage of their literatures or of his spiritual master, if he is sincere in 
his devotional service he is helped by Kr�lJ.a Himself within his heart. So 
the sincere devotee engaged in Kr�lJ.a consciousness cannot be without 
knowledge. The only qualification is that one carry out devotional service 
in full Kr�lJ.a consciousness. 
The modern philosophers think that without discriminating one cannot 
have pure knowledge. For them this answer is given by the Supreme Lord: 
those who are engaged in pure devotional service, even though they be

without sufficient education and even without sufficient knowledge of 
the Vedic principles, are still helped by the Supreme God, as stated in 
this verse. 
The Lord tells Arjuna that basically there is no possibility of under­
standing the Supreme Truth, the Absolute Truth, the Supreme Person­
ality of Godhead, simply by speculating, for the Supreme Truth is so 
great that it is not possible to understand Hini or to achieve Him simply 
by making a mental effort. Man can go on speculating for several millions 
of years, and if he is not devoted, if he is not a lover of the Supreme Truth, 
he will never understand Kr�Q.a or the Supreme Truth. Only by devotional 
service is the Supreme Truth, Kr�Q.a, pleased, and by His inconceivable 
energy He can reveal Himself to the heart of the pure devotee. The pure 
devotee always has Kr�Q.a within his heart; therefore he is just like the sun 
that dissipates the darkness of ignorance. This is the special mercy ren­
dered to the pure devotee by Kr�Q.a. 
Due to the contamination of material association, through many, many 
millions of births, one's heart is always covered with the dust of material­
ism, but when one engages in devotional service and constantly chants 
Hare Kr�Q.a, the dust quickly clears, and one is elevated to the platform of 
pure knowledge. The ultimate goal of Vi�Q.U can be attained only by this 
chant and by devotional service, and not by mental speculation or argu­
ment. The pure devotee does not have to worry about the necessities of 
life; he need not be anxious because when he removes the darkness from 
his heart, everything is provided automatically by the Supreme Lord, for 
He is pleased by the loving devotional service of the devotee. This is the 
essence of the Gitii's teachings. By studying Bhagavad-gitii, one can become 
a completely surrendered soul to the Supreme Lord and engage himself in 
pure devotional service. As the Lord takes charge, one becomes completely 
free from all kinds of materialistic endeavors.

TRANSLATION 
Arjuna said: You are the Supreme Brahman, the ultimate, the supreme 
abode and purifier, the Absolute Truth and the eternal divine person. You 
are the primal God, tranScendental and original, and You are the unborn 
and all-pervading beauty. All the great sages such as Narada, Asita, Devala, 
and Vyasa proclaim this of You, and now You Yourself are declaring itto 
me. 
PURPORT 
In these two verses the Supreme Lord gives a chance to the modern 
philosopher, for here it is clear that the Supreme is different from the 
individual soul. Arjuna, after hearing the essential four verses of Bhagavad­
gitii in this chapter, became completely free from all doubts and accepted 
Kr�l)a as the Supreme Personality of Godhead. He at once boldly declares, 
"You are Parambrahma, the Supreme Personality of Godhead." And 
previously Kr�l)a states that He is the originator of everything and every­
one. Every demigod and every human being is dependent on Him. Men 
and demigods, out of ignorance, think that they are absolute and indepen-
Texts 12-13] 
The Opulence of the Absolute 
511 
dent of the Supreme Lord Kr�Q.a. That ignorance is removed perfectly by 
the discharge of devotional service. This is already explained in the pre­
vious verse by the Lord. Now by His grace, Arjuna is accepting Him as the 
Supreme Truth, in concordance with the Vedic injunction. It is not 
because Kr�J.la is an intimate friend of Arjuna that he is flattering Him by 
calling Him the Supreme Personality of Godhead, the Absolute Truth. 
Whatever Arjuna says in these two verses is confirmed by Vedic truth. 
Vedic injunctions affirm that only one who takes to devotional service to 
the Supreme Lord can understand Him, whereas others cannot. Each and 
every word of this verse spoken by Arjuna is confirmed by Vedic injunc­
tion. 
In the Kena Upani§ad it is stated that the Supreme Brahman is the rest 
for everything, and Kr�J.la has already explained that everything is resting 
on Him. The Mur-{iaka Upan�ad confirms that the Supreme Lord, in whom 
everything is resting, can be realized only by those who engage constantly 
in thinking of Him. This constant thinking of Kr�J.la is smarar.am, one of 
the methods of devotional service. It is only by devotional service to 
Krf?J.la that one can understand his position and get rid of this material 
body. 
In the Vedas the Supreme Lord is accepted as the purest of the pure. 
One who understands that Kr�J.la is the purest of the pure can become 
purified from all sinful activities. One cannot be disinfected from sinful 
activities unless he surrenders unto the Supreme Lord. Arjuna's acceptance 
of Kr�J.la as the supreme pure complies with the injunctions of Vedic 
literature. This is also confirmed by great personalities, of whom Narada is 
the chief. 
Kr�J.la is the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and one should always 
meditate upon Him and enjoy one's transcendental relationship with Him. 
He is the supreme existence. He is free from bodily needs, birth and death. 
Not only does Arjuna confirm this, but all the Vedic literatures, the 
Puriirws and histories. In all Vedic literatures Kr�J.la is thus described, and 
the Supreme Lord Himself also says in the Fourth Chapter, "Although I 
am unborn, I appear on this earth to establish religious principles." He is 
the supreme origin; He has no cause, for He is the cause of all causes, and 
everything is emanating from Him. This perfect knowledge can be had by 
tjle grace of the Supreme Lord. 
Here Arjuna expresses himself through the grace of Kr�I).a. If we want 
to understand Bhagavad-gitii, we should accept the statements in these two 
verses. This is called the paramparii system, acceptance of the disciplic 
succession. Unless one is in the disciplic succession, he cannot understand 
I

512 
Bhagavad-gita As It Is 
[Ch. 10 
Bhagavad-gi:tii. It is not possible by so-called academic education. Unfor­
tunately those proud of their academic educati�n, despite so much 
evidence in Vedic literatures, stick to their obstinate conviction that Kr�l)a 
is an ordinary person.

PURPORT 
Arjuna herein confirms that persons of faithless and demonic nature 
cannot understand Kr�l)a. He is not even known by the demigods, so what 
to speak of the so-called scholars of this modern world? By the grace of the 
Supreme �ord, Arjuna� has understood that the Supreme Truth is Kr�l)a 
and that He is the perfect one. One should therefore follow the path of 
Arjuna. He received the authority of Bhagavad-gi:tii. As described in the 
Fourth Chapter, the paramparii system of disciplic succession for the 
understanding of Bhagavad-gi:tii was lost, and therefore Kr�Da reestablished 
that disciplic succession with Arjuna because He considered Arjuna His 
intimate friend and a great devotee. Therefore, as stated in our Introduction 
to Gi:topani�ad, Bhagavad-gi:tii should be understood in the paramparii sys-

tern. When the paramparii system was lost, Arjuna was again selected to 
rejuvenate it. The acceptance of Arjuna of all that Kr�l).a says should be 
emulated; then we can understand the essence of Bhagavad-gitii, and then 
only can we understand that Kr�l).a is the Supreme Personality of Go,dhead.

Indeed, You alone know Yourself by Your own potencies, 0 origin of

PURPORT 
The Supreme Lord Kr�l).a can be known by persons who are in a rela­
tionship with Him through the discharge of devotional service, like Arjuna 
and his successors. Persons of demonic or atheistic mentality cannot know 
Kr�J).a. Mental speculation that leads one away from the Supreme Lord is 
a serious sin, and one who does not know Kr�l).a should not try to comment 
on Bhagavad-gitii. Bhagavad-gitii is the statement of Kr�l).a, and since it is 
the science of Kr�l).a, it should be understood from Kr�l).a as Arjuna under­
stood it. It should not be received from atheistic persons. 
The Supreme Truth is realized in three aspects: as impersonal Brahman, 
localized Paramatma and at last as the Supreme Personality of Godhead. 
So at the last stage of understanding the Absolute Truth, one comes to the 
514 
Bhagavad-gita As It Is 
[Ch. lO 
Supreme Personality of Godhead. A liberated man and even a common 
man may realize impersonal Brahman or localized Paramatma, yet they 
may not understand God's personality from the verses of Bhagavad-gitii, 
which are being spoken by this person, Kr�l).a. Sometimes the impersonalists 
accept Kr�Q.a as Bhagavan, or they accept His authority. Yet many liberated 
persons cannot understand Kr�Q.a as Puru�ottama, the Supreme Person, the 
father of all living entities. Therefore Aijuna addresses Him as Puru�ottama. 
And if one comes to know Him as the father of all the living entities, 
still one may not know Him as the supreme controller; therefore He is 
addressed here as Bhutesa, the supreme controller of everyone. And even 
·if one knows Kn;Q.a as the supreme controller of all living entities, still one 
may not know that He is the origin of all the demigods; therefore He is 
addressed herein as Devadeva, the worshipful God of all demigods. And 
even if one knows Him as. the worshipful God of all demigods, one may 
not know that He is the supreme proprietor of everything; therefore He is 
addressed as Jagatpati. Thus the truth about Kr�Q.a is established in this 
verse by the realization of Aijuna, and we should follow in the footsteps 
of Aijuna to understand Kr�t:ta as He is.

In this verse it appears that Aijuna is already satisfied with his under­
standing of the Supreme Lord Kr�va. By Kr�va's grace, Aijuna has personal 
experience, intelligence and knowledge and whatever else a person may 
have through all these agencies, and he has understood Kr�va as the Su­
preme Personality of Godhead. For him there is no doubt, yet he is asking 
Kr�va to explain His all-pervading nature so that in the future people will 
understand, especially the impersonalists, how He exists in His all-pervading 
aspect through His different energies. One should know that this is being 
asked by Aijuna on behalf of the common people.

PURPORT 
As it is stated in the previous chapter, the Supreme Personality of God­
head is covered by His yoga-miiyii. Only surrendered souls and devotees 
can see Him. Now Arjuna is convinced that His friend, Kr�va, is the Su­
preme Godhead, but he wants to know the general process by which 
the all-pervading Lord can be understood by the common man. No com­
mon man, including the demons and atheists, can know Kr�va because He

is guarded by His yoga-miiyii energy. Again, these questions are asked by 
Arjuna for their benefit. The superior devotee is not only concerned for 
his own understanding, but for the understanding of all mankind. Out of 
his mercy, because he is a V ai�Q.ava, a devotee, Arjuna is opening the under­
standing for the common man as far as the all-pervasiveness of the Supreme 
is concerned. He addresses Kr�Q.a specifically as yogin because Sr1 Kr�Q.a 
is the master of the yoga-miiyii energy by which He is covered and un­
covered to the common man. The common man who has no love for Kr�Q.a 
cannot always think of Kr�Q.a; therefore he has to think materially. Arjuna 
is considering the mode of thinking of the materialistic persons of this 
world. Because materialists cannot understand Kr�Q.a spiritually, they are 
advised to concentrate the mind on physical things and try to see how 
Kr�Q.a is manifested by physical representations.

"One can never be satiated even though one continuously hears the tran­
scendental pastimes of Kr�Q.a, who is glorified by Vedic hymns. Those who 
have entered into a transcendental relationship with Kr�Q.a relish in every 
step descriptions of the pastimes of the Lord." Thus Arjuna is interested 
to hear about Kr�Q.a, specifically how He remains as the all-pervading 
Supreme Lord. 
Now as far as amrtam, nectar, is concerned, any narration or statement 
concerning Kr�Q.a is just like nectar. And this nectar can be perceived by 
practical experience. Modern stories, fiction and histories are different 
from the transcendental pastimes of the Lord in that one will tire of 
hearing mundane stories, but one never tires of hearing about Kr�I).a. It is 
for this reason only that the history of the whole universe is replete with 
references to the pastimes of the incarnations of Godhead. For instance, 
the Puriirws are histories of bygone ages that relate the pastimes of the 
various incarnations of the Lord. In this way the reading matter remains 
forever fresh, despite repeated readings.

Bhagavad-gita.As It Is 
PURPORT 
[Ch. 10 
It is not possible to comprehend the greatness of Kr�I;Ia and His opu­
lences. The senses of the individual soul are imperfect and do not permit 
him to understand the totality of Kr�I;Ia's affairs. Still the devotees try to 
understand Kr�I;Ia, but not on the principle that they will be able to under­
stand Krwa fully at any specific time or in any state of life. Rather, the 
very topics of Kr�I;Ia are so relishable that they appear to them as nectar. 
Thus they enjoy them. In discussing Kr�I;Ia's opulences and His diverse 
energies, the pure devotees take transcendental pleasure. Therefore they 
want to hear and discuss them. Kr�I;Ia knows that living entities do not 
understand the extent of His opulences; He therefore agrees to state only 
the principal manifestations of His different energies. The word priidhiin­
yata[L (principal) is very important because we can understand only a few 
of the principal details of the Supreme Lord, forHis features are unlimited. 
It is not possible to understand them all. And vibhiiti, as used in this verse, 
refers to the opulences by which He controls the whole manifestation. In 
the Amara-kosa dictionary it is stated that vibhiiti indicates an exceptional 
opulence. 
The impersonalist or the pantheist cannot understand the exceptional 
opulences of the Supreme Lord nor the manifestations of His divine energy. 
Both in the material world and in the spiritual world His energies are dis­
tributed in every variety of manifestation. Now Kr�I;Ia is describing what 
can be directly perceived by the common man; thus part of His variegated 
energy is described in this way.

PURPORT 
In this verse Arjuna is addressed as Gw;Iakesa, which means one who has 
conquered the darkness of sleep. For those who are sleeping in the darkness 
of ignorance, it is not possible to understand how the Supreme Godhead 
manifests Himself in the material and spiritual worlds. Thus this address 
by Kr�l).a to Arjuna is significant. Because Arjuna is above such darkness, 
the Personality of Godhead agrees to describe His various opulences. 
Kr�l).a first informs Arjuna that He is the Self or soul of the entire 
cosmic manifestation by dint of His primary expansion. Before the material 
creation, the Supreme Lord, by His plenary expansion, accepts the Puru�a 
incarnations, and from Him everything begins. Therefore He is iitmii, the 
soul of the mahat-tattva, the universal elements. The total material energy 
is not the cause of the creation, but actually the Maha-Vi�l).u enters into the 
mahat-tattva, the total material energy. He is the soul. When Maha-Vi�I).U 
enters into the manifested universes, He again manifests Himself as the 
Supersoul in each and every entity- We have experience that the personal 
body of the living entity exists due to the presence of the spiritual spark_ 
Without the existence of the spiritual spark, the body cannot develop. 
Similarly, the material manifestation cannot develop unless the Supreme 
Soul of Kr�l).a enters. 
The Supreme Personality of Godhead is existing as the Supersoul in all 
manifested universes. A description of the three puru�a-avatiiras is given 
in Srimad-Bhiigavatam. "The Supreme Personality of Godhead manifests 
three features, as Karapodaka8ayi Vi�l).u, Garbhodaka8ayi V�pu and 
�irodaka8ayi Vi�pu, in this material manifestation." The Supreme Lo,rd 
�Qa, the cause of all causes, lies down in the cosmic ocean as Maha­
Vi�QU or Karapodaka8ayi Vi�Qu, and therefore Kr�n,a is the beginning of 
this universe, the maintainer of the universal manifestation, and the end of 
all the energy.

Of priests, 0 Aijuna, know Me to be the chief, Brhaspati, the lord of 
devotion. Of generals I am Skanda, the lord of war; and of bodies of water 
I am the ocean. 
PURPORT 
Indra is the chief demigod of the heavenly planets and is known as the 
king of the heavens. The planet in which he reigns is called lndraloka. 
Brhaspati is Indra's priest, and since Indra is the chief of all kings, 
Brhaspati is the chief of all priests. And as lndra is the chief of all kings, 
similarly Skanda, the son of Piirvati and Lor.d Siva, is the chief of all 
military commanders. And of all bodies of water, the ocean is the greatest. 
These representations of Knn;ta only give hints of His greatness.

TRANSLATION 
Of the great sages I am Bhrgu; of vibrations I am the transcendental om. 
Of sacrifices I am the chanting of the holy names (japa], and of immovable 
things I am the Himalayas. 
PURPORT 
Brahma, the first living creature within the universe, created several 
sons for the propagation of various kinds of species. The most powerful 
of his sons is Bhrgu, who is also the greatest sage. Of all the transcendental 
vibrations, the "om" (omkara) represents the Supreme. Of all the sacrifices, 
the chanting of Hare KnnJ.a, Hare Kr�l).a, Kr�l).a Kr�l).a, Hare Hare/ Hare 
Rama, Hare Rama, Rama Rama, Hare Hare is the purest representation of 
Kr�l).a. Sometimes animal sacrifices are recommended, but in the sacrifice 
of Hare Kr�l).a, Hare Kr�l).a, there is no question of violence. It is the sim­
plest and the purest. Whatever is sublime in the worlds is a representation 
of Kr�;>l).a. Therefore the Himalayas, the greatest mountains in the world, 
also represent Him. The mountain named Meru was mentioned in a previous 
verse, but Meru is sometimes movable, whereas the Himalayas are never 
movable. Thus the Himalayas are greater than Meru.

Of all trees I am the holy fig tree, and amongst sages and demigods I am

PURPORT 
The fig tree ( asvattha) is one of the most beautiful and highest trees, and 
people in India often worship it as one of their daily morning rituals. 
Amongst the demigods they also worship Narada, who is considered the 
greatest devotee in the universe. Thus he is the representation of Kr�l).a as 
a devotee. The Gandharva planet is filled with entities who sing beautifully, 
and among them the best singer is Citraratha. Amongst the perpetually 
living entities, Kapila is considered an incarnation of Kr!!!J.a, and His phi­
losophy is mentioned in the Srimad-Bhiigavatam. Later on another Kapila 
became famous, but his philosophy was atheistic. Thus there is a gulf of 
difference between them.

The Opulence of the Absolute 
525 
PURPORT 
The devotee demigods and the demons (asuras) once took a se,a journey. 
On this journey, nectar and poison were produced, and Lord Siva drank 
the poison. From the nectar were produced many entities, of which there 
was a horse named U ccai\1-srava. Another animal produced from the nectar 
was an elephant harned Airavata. Because these two animals were produced 
from nectar, they have special significance, and they are representatives of 
Kr�Q.a. 
Amongst the human beings, the king is the representative of Kr�Q.a 
because Kr�Q.a is the maintainer of the universe, and the kings, who are 
appointed on account of their godly qualifications, are maintainers of their 
kingdoms. Kings like Maharaja Yudhi�thira, Maharaja Parik�it and Lord 
Rama were all highly righteous kings who always thought of the citizens' 
welfare. In Vedic literature, the king is considered to be the representative 
of God. In this age, however, with the corruption of the principles of 
religion, monarchy decayed and is now finally abolished. It is to be under­
stood that in the past, however, people were more happy under righteous 
kings.

526 
Bhagavad-gita As It Is 
[Ch. 10 
PURPORT 
The thunderbolt, indeed a mighty weapon, represents Kr�J)a's power. 
In Kr�J)aloka in the spiritual sky there are cows which can be milked at 
any time, and they give as much milk as one likes. Of course such cows do 
not exist in this material world, but there is mention of them in Krwaloka. 
The Lord keeps many such cows, which are called surabhi. It is stated that 
the Lord is engaged in herding the surabhi cows. Kandarpa is the sex desire 
for presenting good sons; therefore Kandarpa is the representative of Kr�J)a. 
Sometimes sex is engaged in only for sense gratification; such sex does not 
represent Kr�J)a. But sex for the generation of good children is called 
Kandarpa and represents Kr�J)a.

the feathered carrier of Vi�I).U. 
PURPORT 
Diti and Aditi are two sisters. The sons of Aditi are called Adityas, and 
the sons of Diti are called Daityas. All the Adityas are devotees of the 
Lord, and all the Daityas are atheistic. Although Prahlada was born in the 
family of the Daityas, he was a great devotee from his childhood. Because 
of his devotional service and godly nature, he is considered to be a repre­
sentative of Kr�Q.a. 
There are many subduing principles, but time wears down all things in 
the material universe and so represents Kr�Q.a. Of the many animals, the 
lion is the most powerful and ferocious, and of the million varieties of 
birds, Garu.,a, the bearer of Lord Vi�I).U, is the greatest.

most dangerous to man. Thus the shark represents Kn;:t;J.a. And of rivers, 
the greatest in India is the Mother Ganges. Lord Ramacandra, of the Riimii­

Among created manifestations, the total material elements are first 
created by Maha-Vi�l).U and are annihilated by Lord Siva. Brahma is the 
secondary creator. All these created elements are different incarnations of 
the material qualities of the Supreme Lord; therefore He is the beginning, 
the middle and the end of all creation. 
Regarding the spiritual science of the Self, there are many literatures, 
such as the four Vedas, the Vedanta-siitra and the Purap,as, the Srimad­
Bhiigavatam and the Gita. These are all representatives of Kr�IJ.a. Among 
logicians there are , different stages of argument. The presentation of evi­
dence is called japa. The attempt to defeat one another is called vitap,pa, 
and the final conclusion is called vada. The conclusive truth, the end of all 
reasoning processes, is Kr�IJ.a.

Of letters I am the letter A, and among compounds I am the dual word. 
I am also inexhaustahle time, and of creators I am Brahmi, whose mani­
fold faces tum everywhere. 
PURPORT 
Akiira, the first letter of the Sanskrit alphabet, is the beginning of the 
Vedic literature. Without akiira, nothing can be sounded; therefore it is the 
beginning of sound. In Sanskrit there are also many compound words, of 
which the dual word, like Rama-kr�l}.a, is called dvandva�. For instance, 
Rama and Kr�l}.a have the same rhythm and therefore are called dual. 
Among all kinds of killers, time is the ultimate because time kills every­
thing. Time is the representative of Kr�l}.a because in due course of time 
there will be a great fire and everything will be annihilated. 
Among the creators and living entities, Brahma is the chief. The various 
Brahmas exhibit four, eight, sixteen, etc., heads accordingly, and they are 
the chief creators in their respective universes. The Brahmas are represen­
tatives of Kr�l).a.

The Opulence of the Absolute 
531 
PURPORT 
As soon as a man is born, he dies at every moment. Thus death is devour­
ing every living entity at every moment, hut the last stroke is called death 
itself. That death is Kr�t;ta. All species of life undergo six basic changes. 
They are born, they grow, they remain for some time, they reproduce, 
they dwindle and finally vanish. Of these changes, the first is deliverance 
from the womb, and that is Kr�t;ta. The first generation is the beginning of 
all future activities. 
The six opulences listed are considered to be feminine. If a woman 
possesses all of them or some of them she becomes glorious. Sanskrit is a 
perfect language and is therefore very glorious. After studying, if-one can 
remember the subject matter, he is gifted with good memory, or smrti. 
One need not read many hooks on different subject matters; the ability to 
remember a few and quote them when necessary is also another opulence.

Of hymns I am the Brhat -sama sung to the Lord Indra, and of poetry I

and December, and of seasons I am flower-bearing spring. 
PURPORT 
It has already been explained by the Lord that amongst all the Vedas, 
the Siima-v�da is rich with beautiful songs played by the various demigods. 
532 
Bhagavad-gita As It Is 
[Ch. 10 
One of these songs is the Brhat-siima, which has an exquisite melody and 
is sung at midnight. 
In Sanskrit, there are definite rules that regulate poetry; rhyme and 
meter are not written whimsically, as in much modern poetry. Amongst 
the regulated poetry, the Gayatri mantra, which is chanted by the duly 
qualified briihmacws, 
is 
the 
most 
prominent. 
The 
Gayatri mantra 
is mentioned in the Srimad-Bhiigavatam. Because the Gayatri mantra is 
especially meant for God realization, it represents the Supreme Lord. 
This mantra is meant for spiritually advanced people, and when one attains 
success in chanting it, he can enter into the transcendental position of the 
Lord. One must first acquire the qualities of the perfectly situated person, 
the qualities of goodness according to the laws of material nature, in order 
to chant the Gayatri mantra. The Gayatri mantra is very important in Vedic 
civilization and is considered to be the sound incarnation of Brahman. 
Brahma is its initiator, and it is passed down from him in disciplic 
succession. 
The months of November and December are considered the best of all 
months because in India grains are collected from the fields at this time, 
and the people become very happy. Of course spring is a season universally 
liked because it is neither too hot nor too cold, and the flowers and trees 
blossom and flourish. In spring there are also many ceremonies commem­
orating Kr�t;�.a's pastimes; therefore this is considered to be the most joyful 
of all seasons, and it is the representative of the Supreme Lord Kr�Q.a.

I am victory, I am adventure, and I am the strength of the strong. 
PURPORT 
There are many kinds of cheaters all over the universe. Of all cheating 
processes, gambling stands supreme and therefore represents Kr�l)a. As the 
Supreme, Kr�Qa can be more deceitful than any mere man. If Krwa 
chooses to deceive a person, no one can surpass Him in His deceit. His 
greatness is not simply one-sided-it is all-sided. 
Among the victorious, He is victory. He is the splendor of the splendid. 
Among enterprising industrialists, He is the most enterprising. Among 
adventurers, He is the most adventurous, and among the strong, He is the 
strongest. When Kr�l)a was present on earth, no one could surpass Him in 
strength. Even in His childhood He lifted Govardhana Hill. No one can 
surpass Him in cheating, no one can surpass Him in splendor, no one can 
surpass Him in victory, no one can surpass Him in enterprise, and no one 
can surpass Him in strength.

Bhagavad-gita ·As It Is 
[Ch. 10 
PURPORT 
Kr�Q.a is the original Supreme Personality of Godhead, and Vasudeva is 
the immediate expansion of Kr�Q.a. Both Lord Kr�Q.a and Baladeva appear 
as the sons of Vasudeva. Amongst the sons of PiiQ.QU, Arjuna is famous and 
valiant. Indeed, he is the best of men and therefore represents Kr�Q.a. 
Among the munis, or learned men conversant in Vedic knowledge, Vyasa 
is the greatest because he explained Vedic knowledge in many different 
ways for the understanding of the common mass of people in this age of 
Kali. And Vyasa is also known as an incarnation of Kr�Q.a; therefore Vyasa 
also represents Kr�Q.a. Kavis are those who are capable of thinking thor­
oughly on any subject matter. Among the kavis, Usana was the spiritual 
master of the demons; he was extremely intelligent, far-seeing, political 
and spiritual in every way. Thus Usana is another representative of the 
opulence of Kr�Q.a.

There are many suppressing agents, of which the most important are 
those that cut down the miscreants. When miscreants are punished, the 
Text 40]

rod of chastisement represents Kr�J).a. Among those who are trying to be 
victorious in some field of activity, the most victorious element is morality. 
Among the confidential activities of hearing, thinking and meditating, 
silence is most important because by silence one can make progress very 
quickly. The wise man is he who can discriminate between matter and 
spirit, between God's superior and inferior natures. Such knowledge is 
Kr�J).a Himself.

Everything has a cause, and that cause or seed of manifestation is Kr�J).a. 
Without Kr�J;la's energy, nothing can exist; therefore He is called omni­
potent. Without His potency, neither the movable nor the unmovable can 
exist. Whatever existence is not founded on the energy of Kr�J).a is called

PURPORT 
As stated in the Vedic literature, although the opulences and energies of 
the Supreme are understood in various ways, there is no limit to such 
opulences; therefore not all the opulences and energies can be explained. 
Simply a few examples are being described to Arjuna to pacify his 
inquisitiveness.

PURPORT 
Any glorious or beautiful existence should be understood to be but a 
fragmental manifestation of Kr�l).a's opulence, whether it be in the spiritual 
or material world. Anything extraordinarily opulent should be considered 
to represent Kr�l).a 's opulence.

PURPORT 
The Supreme Lord is represented throughout the entire ,material uni­
verses by His entering into all things as the Supersoul. The Lord here tells 
Aijuna that there is no point in understanding how things exist in their 
separate opulence and grandeur. He should know that all things are existing 
.c 
. 
538 
Bhagavad-gita As It Is 
[Ch. 10. 
due to Kr�I).a 's entering them as SupersouL From Brahma, the most gigantic 
entity, on down to the smallest ant, all are existing because the Lord has 
entered each and all and is sustaining them. 
Worship of demigods is discouraged herein because even the greatest 
demigods like Brahma and Siva only represent part of the opulence of the 
Supreme Lord. He is the origin of everyone born, and no one is greater 
than Him. He is samatii, which means that no one is superior to Him and 
that no one is equal to Him. In the V4TJu-mantra it is said that one who 
considers the Supreme Lord Kr�I).a in the same category with demigods­
be they eyen Brahma or Siva-becomes at once an atheist. If, however, one 
thoroughly studies the different descriptions of the opulences and expan­
sions of Kr�IJa's energy, then one can understand without any doubt the 
position of Lord Sri Kr�IJa and can fix his mind in the worship of Kr�IJa 
without deviation. The Lord is all-pervading by the expansion of His 
partial representation, the Supersoul, who enters into everything that is. 
Pure devotees, therefore, concentrate their minds in Kr�I).a consciousness 
in full devotional service; therefore they are always situated in the tran­
scendental position. Devotional service and worship of Kr�I).a are very 
clearly indicated in this chapter in verses eight to eleven. That is the way 
of pure devotional service. How one can attain the highest devotional 
perfection of association with the Supreme Personality of Godhead has 
been thoroughly explained in this chapter. 
Thus end the Bhaktivedanta Purports to the Tenth Chapter of the 
Srimad-Bhagavad-gita in the matter of the Opulence of the Absolute.

[Ch. 11 . 
PURPORT 
This chapter reveals Kr�IJ.a as the cause of all causes. He is even the cause 
of the l\1aha-Vi�IJ.U, and from Him the material universes emanate. Kr�IJ.a is 
not an incarnation; l-Ie is the source of all incarnations. That has been 
completely explained in the last chapter. 
Now, as far as Arjuna is concerned, he says that his illusion is over. This 
means that Arjuna no longer thinks of Kr�IJ.a as a mere human being, as a 
friend of his, but as the source of everything. Arjuna is very enlightened 
and is glad that he has a great friend like Kr�IJ.a, but now he is thinking 
that although he may accept Kr�IJ.a as the source of everything, others may 
not. So in order to establish Kr�IJ.a's divinity for all, he is requesting Kr�IJ.a 
in this chapter to show His universal form. Actually when one sees the 
universal form of Kr�IJ.a one becomes frightened, like Arjuna, but Krgta is 
so kind that after showing it He converts Himself again into His original 
form. Arjuna agrees to what Kr�IJ.a says several times. Kr�IJ.a is speaking 
to him just for his benefit, and Arjuna acknowledges that all this is hap­
pening to him by Kr�IJ.a's grace. He is now convinced that Kr�IJ.a is the 
cause of all causes and is present in everyone's heart as the Supersoul.

The Universal Form 
541. 
PURPORT 
Aijuna addresses Lord Kr�I;ta as "lotus-eyed" (Kr�I;ta's eyes appear just 
like the petals of a lotus flower) out of his joy, for Kn>I;ta has assured him, 
in the last verse of the previous chapter, that He sustains the entire universe 
with just a fragment of Himself. He is the source of everything in this 
material manifestation, and Aijuna has heard of this from the Lord in 
detail. Aijuna further knows that in spite of His being the source of all 
appearances and disappearances, He is aloof from them. 'His personality is 
not lost, although He is all-pervading. That is the inconceivable opulence 
of Kr�I;ta which Aijuna admits that he has thoroughly understood.

PURPORT 
The Lord said that because He entered into the ma�erial universe by His 
personal representation, the cosmic manifestation ha� been made possible 
and is going on. Now as far as Aijuna is concerned, h'e- is inspired by the 
statements of Kr�J;ta, but in order to convince others in the future who 
542 
Bhagavad-glta As It Is 
[Ch. 11 . 
may think that Kr�Q.a is an ordinary person, he desires to see Him actuaily 
in His universal form, to see how He is acting from within the universe, 
although He is apart from it. Arjuna's asking the Lord's permission is also 
significant. Since the Lord is the Supreme Personality of Godhead, He is 
present within Arjuna himself; therefore He knows the desire of Arjuna, 
and He can understand that Arjuna has no special desire to see Him in His 
universal form, for he is completely satisfied to see Him in His personal 
form of Kr�Q.a. But He can understand also that Arjuna wants to see the 
universal form to convince others. He did not have any personal desire for 
confirmation. Kr�l'}.a also understands that Arjuna wants to see the universal 
form to set a criterion, for in the future there would be so many imposters 
who would pose themselves as incarnations of God. The people, therefore, 
should be careful; one who claims to be Kr�Q.a should be prepared to show 
his universal form to confirm his claim to the people.

PURPORT 
It is said that one can neither see, hear, understand nor perceive the 
Supreme Lord, Kr�Q.a, by the material senses. But if one is engaged in 
Text 5] 
The Universal Form 
543 
loving transcendental service to the Lord from the beginning, then one can 
see the Lord by revelation. Every living entity is only a spiritual spark; 
therefore it is not possible to see or to understand the Supreme Lord. 
Arjuna, as a devotee, does not depend on his speculative strength; rather, 
he admits his limitations as a living entity and acknowledges Kr�l).a's 
inestimable position. Arjuna could understand that for a living entity it is 
not possible to understand the unlimited infinite. If the infinite reveals 
Himself, then it is possible to understand the nature of the infinite by the 
grace of the infinite. The word yogesvara is also very significant here 
because the Lord has inconceivable power. If He likes, He can reveal Him­
self by His grace, although He is unlimited. Therefore Arjuna pleads for 
the inconceivable grace of Kr�l).a. He does not give Kr�l).a orders. Kr�l).a is 
not obliged to reveal Himself to anyone unless one surrenders fully in 
Kr�l).a consciousness and engages in devotional service. Thus it is not 
possible for persons who depend on the strength of their mental specula­
tions to see Kr�l).a.

PURPORT 
Arjuna wanted to see Kr�l)a in His universal form, which, although a 
transcendental form, is just manifested for the cosmic manifestation and is 
therefore subject to the temporary time of this material nature. As the 
material nature is manifested and not manifested, similarly this universal 
form of Kr�l)a is manifested and unmanifested. It is not eternally situated 
in the spiritual sky like Kr�l)a 's other forms. As far as a devotee is con­
cerned, he is not eager to see the universal form, but because Arjuna wanted 
to see Kr�l)a in this way, Krwa reveals this form. This universal form is not 
possible to be seen by any ordinary man. Kr�l)a must give one the power 
to see it.

No one can see the entire universe sitting in one place. Even the most 
advanced scientist cannot see what is going on in other parts of the uni­
verse. Kr�J)a gives him the power to see anything he wants to see, past, 
present and future. Thus by the mercy of Kr�IJa, Arjuna is able to see 
everything.

TRANSLATION 
But you cannot see Me with your present eyes. Therefore I give to you 
divine eyes by which you can behold My mystic opulence. 
PURPORT 
A pure devotee does not like to see Krwa in any form except His form 
with two hands; a devotee must see His universal form by His grace, not 
with the mind but with spiritual eyes. To see the universal form of Kr�Q.a, 
Arjuna is told not to change his mind but his vision. The universal form of 
Kr�Q.a is not very important; that will be clear in the verses. Yet because 
Arjuna wanted to see it, the Lord gives him the particular vision required 
to see that universal form. 
Devotees who are correctly situated in a transcendental relationship with 
Kr�Q.a are attracted by loving features, not by a godless display of opu­
lences. The playmates of Kr�Q.a, the friends of Kr�Q.a and the parents of 
Kr�Q.a never want Kr�Qa to show His opulences. They are so immersed in 
pure love that they do not even know that Kr�Qa is the Supreme Person­
ality of Godhead. In their loving exchange they forget that Kr�Qa is the 
Supreme Lord. In the Srimad-Bhiigavatam it is stated that the boys who 
play with Kr�Q.a are all highly pious souls, and after many, many births 
they are able to play with Kr�Q.a. Such boys do not know that Kr�Q.a is the 
Supreme Personality of Godhead. They take Him as a personal friend. The 
Supreme Person is considered as the impersonal Brahman by great sages, 
as the Supreme Personality of Godhead by the devotees, and as a product 
of this material nature by ordinary men. The fact is that the devotee is not 
concerned to see the viSva-rnpa, the universal form, but Arjuna wanted to 
see it to substantiate Kr�Q.a's statement so that in the future people could 
understand that Kr�Q.a not only theoretically or philosophically presented 
Texts I 0-11 ] 
The Universal Form 
547 
Himself as the Supreme but actually presented Himself as such to Arjuna. 
Arjuna must confirm this because Arjuna is the beginning of the paramparii 
system. Those who are actually interested to understand the Supreme 
Personality of Godhead, Kr�Qa, and who follow in the footsteps of Arjuna 
should understand that Kr�Qa not only theoretically presented Himself as 
the Supreme, but actually revealed Himself as the Supreme. 
The Lord gave Arjuna the necessary power to see His universal form 
because He knew that Arjuna did not particularly want to see it, as we have 
already explained.

Arjuna saw in that universal form unlimited mouths and unlimited eyes. 
It was all wondrous. The form was decorated with divine, dazzling orna­
ments and arrayed in many garbs. He was garlanded gloriously, and there 
were many scents smeared over His body. All was magnificent, all-expand­
ing, unlimited. This was seen by Arjuna. 
PURPORT 
These two verses indicate that there is no limit to the hands, mouths, 
legs, etc., of the Lord. These manifestations are distributed throughout the 
universe and are unlimited. By the grace of the Lord, Arjuna could see 
them while sitting in one place. That is due· to the inconceivable potency 
of Krgta.

What Arjuna saw was indescribable, yet Safijaya is trying to give a 
mental picture of that great revelation to Dhrtara�tra. Neither Safijaya nor 
Dhrtara�tra were present, but Safijaya, by the grace of Vyasa, could see 
whatever happened. Thus he now compares the situation, as far as it can 
be understood, to an imaginable phenomenon (i.e. thousands of suns).

PURPORT 
The word tatra (there) is very significant. It indicates that both Arjuna 
and Kn;va were sitting on the chariot when Arjuna saw the universal form. 
Others on the battlefield could not see this form because Kr�va gave the 
vision only to Arjuna. Arjuna could see in the body of Kr�va many thou­
sands of universes. As we learn from Vedic scriptures, there are many 
universes and many planets. Some of them are made of earth, some are 
made of gold, some are made of jewels, some are very great, some are not 
so great, etc. Sitting on his chariot, Arjuna could see all these universes . 
. But no one could understand what was going on between Arjuna and 
Kr�J.la.

Then, bewildered and astonished, his hair standing on end, Arjuna began 
to pray with folded hands, offering obeisances to the Supreme Lord. 
PURPORT 
Once the divine vision is revealed, the relationship between Kr�va and 
Arjuna changes immediately. Before, Kr�va and Arjuna had a relationship 
based on friendship, but here, after the revelation, Arjuna is offering

obeisances with great respect, and with folded hands he is praying to 
Kr�va. He is praising the universal form. Thus A�una's relationship be­
comes one of wonder rather than friendship. Great devotees see Kr�va as 
the reservoir of all relationships. In the scriptures there are twelve basic 
kinds of relationships mentioned, and all of them are present in Kr�va. It 
is said that He is the ocean of all the relationships exchanged between two 
living entities, between the gods, or between the Supreme Lord and His 
devotees. 
It is said that Arjuna was inspired by the relationship of wonder, and in 
that wonder, although he was by nature very sober, calm and quiet, he 
became ecstatic, his hair stood up, and he began to offer his obeisances 
unto the Supreme Lord with folded hands. He was not, of course, afraid. 
He was affected by the wonders of the Supreme Lord. The immediate 
context is wonder; his natural loving friendship was overwhelmed by 
wonder, and thus he reacted in this way.

TRANSLATION 
Arjuna said: My dear Lord Kr�J)a, I see assembled together in Your body 
all the demigods and various other living entities. I see Brahma sitting on 
the lotus flower as well as Lord Siva and many sages and divine serpents. 
PURPORT 
Arjuna sees everything in the universe; therefore he sees Brahma, who is 
the first creature in the universe, and the celestial serpent upon which the 
Garbhodaka8ay1 Vi�J)U lies in the lower regions of the universe. This snake 
bed is called Vasuki. There are also other snakes known as Vasuki. Arjuna 
can see from the Garbhodakasay1 Vi�J)U up to the topmost part of the 
universe on the lotus-flower planet where Brahma, the first creature of the 
universe, resides. That means that from the beginning to the end, every­
thing could be ,seen by Arjuna sitting in one place on his chariot. This was 
possible by the grace of the Supreme Lord, Kr�J)a.

You are the origin without beginning, middle or end. You have number­

Your own radiance You are heating this entire universe. 
PURPORT 
There is no limit to the extent of the six opulences of the Supreme 
Personality of Godhead. Here and in many other places there is repetition, 
hut according to the scriptures, repetition of the glories of Kr�l!a is not a 
literary weakness. It is said that at a time of bewilderment or wonder or of 
great ecstasy, statements are repeated over and over. That is not a flaw.

Dyiiv iiprthivyo[t (the space ,between heaven and earth) and lokatrayam 
(three worlds) are significant words in this verse because it appears that 
not only Arjuna saw this universal form of the Lord, but others in other 
planetary systems also saw it. The vision was not a dream. All who were 
spiritually awake with the divine vision saw it.

In a previous verse the Lord promised to show Arjuna things he would 
by very interested in seeing. Now Arjuna sees that the leaders of the 
opposite party (Bhi�ma, DrotJ.a, Karva and all the sons of Dhrtara�tra) and 
their soldiers and Arjuna's own soldiers are all being annihilated. This is an 
indication that Arjuna will emerge victorious in battle, despite heavy losses 
on both sides. It is also mentioned here that Bhi�ma, who is supposed to 
be unconquerable, will also be smashed. So also Karva. Not only will the 
great warriors of the other party like Bhi�ma be smashed, but some of the 
great warriors of Arjuna 's side also.

PURPORT 
Although Arjuna knew that Kr�Qa was his friend and the Supreme 
Personality of Godhead, he was nonetheless puzzled by the various forms 
564 
Bhagavad-glta As It Is 
[Ch. 11 
exhibited by Kr�l).a. Therefore he asked further about the actual mission 
of this devastating force. It is written in the Vedas that the Supreme Truth 
destroys everything, even Brahm a. Y asya brahme ca k§atram ca ubhe 
bhavata odanaMmrtyur yasyopasecanam ka itthii veda yatra sa[!.. Even­
tually all the briihmar-as, k�atriyas and everyone else are devoured by the 
Supreme. This form of the Supreme Lord is an all-devouring giant, and 
here Kr�l).a presents Himself in that form of all-devouring time. Except 
for a few Pal)..;iavas, everyone who 
·
was present in that battlefield would be 
devoured by Him. 
Arjuna was not in favor of the fight, and he thought it was better not to 
fight; then there would be no frustration. In reply, the Lord is saying that 
even if he did not fight, every one of them would be destroyed, for that is 
His plan. If he stopped fighting, they would die in another way. Death 
cannot be checked, even if he did not fight. In fact, they were already 
dead. Time is destruction, and all manifestations are to be vanquished by 
the desire of the Supreme Lord. That is the law of nature.

Savyasiicin refers to one who can shoot arrows very expertly in the field; 
thus Arjuna is addressed as an expert warrior capable of delivering arrows 
to kill his enemies. "Just become an instrument": nimltta-miitram. This 
word is also very significant. The whole world is movihg according to the 
plan of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Foolish persons who do not 
have sufficient knowledge think that nature is moving without a plan and 
all manifestations are but accidental formations. There are many so-called 
scientists who suggest that perhaps it was like this, or maybe like that, but 
there is no question of "perhaps" and "maybe." There is a specific plan 
being carried out in this material world. What is this plan? This cosmic 
manifestation is a chance for the conditioned souls to go back to Godhead, 
back to home. As long they have the domineering mentality which makes 
them try to lord it over material nature, they are conditioned. But anyone 
who can understand the plan of the Supreme. Lord and cultivate Kr�r;ta 
consciousness is most intelligent. The creation and destruction of the cos­
mic manifestation are under the superior guidance of God. Thus the Battle 
of Kurukt>etra was fought according to the plan of God. Arjuna was refus­
ing to fight, but he was told that he should fight and at the same time 
desire the Supreme Lord. Then he would be happy. If one is in full Krt>r;ta 
consciousness and if his life is devoted to His transcendental service, he is 
perfect.

PURPORT 
Every plan is made by the Supreme Personality of Godhead, but He is 
so kind and merciful to His devotees that He wants to give the credit to 
His devotees who carry out His plan according to His desire. Life should 
therefore move in such a way that everyone acts in Kr�va consciousness 
and understands the Supreme Personality of Godhead through the medium 
of a spiritual master. The plans of the Supreme Personality of Godhead 
are understood by His mercy, and the plans of the devotees are as good as 
His plans. One should follow such plans and be victorious in the struggle 
for existence.

As we have already explained, because of the situation created by the 
universal form of .the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Arjuna became 
bewildered in wonder; thus he began to offer his respectful obeisances to 
Kr�J.la again and again, and with faltering voice he began to pray, not as a 
friend, but as a devotee in wonder.

0 Hr�ikesa, the world becomes joyful upon hearing Your name,.. and thus 
everyone becomes attached to You. Although the perfected beings offer 
You their respectful homage, the demons are afraid, and they flee here and 
there. All this is rightly done. 
PURPORT 
Arjuna, after hearing from Kf$J)a about the outcome of the Battle of 
Kuruk$etra, became an enlightened devotee of the Supreme Lord. He 
admitted that everything done by Kr$J)a is quite fit. Arjuna confirmed that 
Kf$J)a is the maintainer and the object of worship for the devotees and the 
destroyer of the undesirables. His actions are equally good for all. Arjuna 
understood herein that when the Battle of Kuruk$etra was being concluded, 
in outer space there were present many demigods, siddhas, and the intelli­
gentia of the higher planets, and they were observing the fight because 
Kg;J)a was present there. When Arjuna saw the universal form of the Lord, 
the demigods took pleasure in it, hut others, who were demons and atheists, 
could not stand it when the Lord was praised. Out of their natural fear of 
the devastating form of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, they fled. 
Kr$J)a's treatment of the devotees and the atheists is praised by Arjuna. In 
all cases a devotee glorifies the Lord because he knows that whatever He 
does is good for all.

Why should they not offer their homage up to You, 0 limitless one? 0 
refuge of the universe, You are the invincible source, the cause of all 
causes, transcendental to this material manifestation. 
PURPORT 
By this offering of obeisances, Arjuna indicates that Kr�Q.a is worshipable 
by everyone. He is all-pervading, and He is the Soul of every soul. Arjuna 
is addressing Kr�Q.a as mahiitmii, which means that He is most magnanimous 
and unlimited. Ananta indicates that there is nothing which is not covered 
by the influence and energy of the Supreme Lord, and devesa means that 
He is the controller of all demigods and is above them all. He is the center 
of the whole universe. Arjuna also thought that it was fitting that all the 
perfect living entities and all powerful demigods offer their respectful obei­
sances unto Him becat,tse no one is greater than Him. He especially mentions 
that Kr�Qa is greater than Brahma because Brahma is created by Him. 
Brahma is born out of the lotus stem grown from the navel abdomen of -
Garbhodakasayi Vi�Q.u, who is Kr�Q.a's plenary expansion; therefore Brahm a 
and Lord Siva, who is born of Brahma, and all other demigods must offer 
their respectful obeisances. Thus the Lord is respected by Lord Siva and 
Brahma and similar other demigods. The word ak�aram is very significant 
because this material creation is subject to destruction, but the Lord is 
above this material creation. He is the cause of all causes, and being so, 
He is superior to all the conditioned souls within this material nature as 
well as the material cosmic manifestation itself. He is therefore the all­
great Supreme.

PURPORT 
Everything is resting on the Supreme Personality of Godhead; therefore 
He is the ultimate rest. Nidhiinam means that everything, even the Brahman 
effulgence, rests on the Supreme Personality of Godhead Kr�J)a. He is the 
knower of everything that is happening in this world, and if knowledge has 
any end, He is the end of all knowledge; therefore He is the known and the 
knowable. He is the object of knowledge because He is all-pervading. 
Because He is the cause in the spiritual world, He is transcendentaL He is 
also the chief personality in the transcendental world.

The Lord is addressed here as air because the air is the most impor­
tant representation of all the demigods, being all-pervasive. Arjuna also 
addresses Kr�J.la as the grandfather because He is the father of Brahma, the 
first living creature in the universe.

Out of loving ecstasy for Kr�Q.a, his friend, Arjuna is offering his respects 
from all sides. He is accepting that He is the master of all potencies and all

I have in the past addressed You as "0 Kr�J}.a," "0 Yadava," "0 my

done in madness or in love. I have dishonored You many times while 
relaxing or while lying on the same bed or eating together, sometimes 
alone and sometimes in front of many friends. Please excuse me for all my 
offenses. 
PURPORT 
Although Kr�J)a is manifested before Aijuna in His universal form, 
Arjuna remembers his friendly relationship with Kr�J)a and is therefore 
asking pardon and requesting Him to excuse him for the many informal 
gestures which arise out of friendship. He is admitting that formerly he did 
not know that Kr�J)a could assume such a universal form, although He 
explained it as his intimate friend. Arjuna did not know how many times 
he may have dishonored Him by addressing Him as "0 my friend, 0 
Kr�J)a, 0 Yadava," etc., without acknowledging His opulence. But Kr�J)a 
is so kind and merciful that in spite. of such opulence He played with 
Arjuna as a friend. Such is the transcendental loving reciprocation between 
the devotee and the Lord. The relationship between the living entity and 
Kr�J)a is fixed eternally; it cannot be forgotten, as we can see from the 
/

behavior of Atjuna. Although Atjuna has seen the opulence in the universal 
form, he could not forget his friendly relationship with Kr�Q.a-

TRANSLATION 
You are the father of this complete cosmic manifestation, the worship­
able chief, the spiritual master. No one is equal to You, nor can anyone be 
one with You. Within the three worlds, You are immeasurable. 
PURPORT 
The Lord Kr�va is worshipable as a father is worshipable for his son_ He 
is the spiritual master because He originally gave the Vedic instructions to 
Brahma, and presently He is also instructing Bhagavad-gitii to Arjuna; 
therefore He is the original spiritual master, and any bona fide spiritual 
master at the present moment must be a descendant in the line of disciplic 
succession stemming from Kr�Q.a. Without being a representative of Kr�Q.a, 
one cannot become a teacher or spiritual master of transcendental sub­
ject matter. 
Text 44] 
The Universal F<:>rm 
575. 
The Lord is being paid obeisances in all respects. He is of immeasurable 
greatness. No one can be greater than the Supreme Personality of Godhead, 
Kr�J)a, because no one is equal to or higher than Kr�J)a within any mani­
festation, spiritual or material. Everyone is below Him. No one can excel 
Him. 
The Supreme Lord Kr�J)a has senses and a body like the ordinary man, 
but for Him there is no difference between His senses, body, mind and 
Himself. Foolish persons who do not know Him perfectly say that Kr�J)a is 
different from His soul, mind, heart and everything else. Kr�J)a is absolute; 
therefore His activities and potencies are supreme. It is also stated that 
He does not have senses like· ours. He can perform all sensual activities; 
therefore His senses are neither imperfect nor limited. No one can be 
greater than Him, no one can be equal to Him, and everyone is lower than 
Him. 
Whoever knows His transcendental body, activities and perfection, after 
quitting his body, returns to Him and doesn't come back again to this 
miserable world. Therefore one should know that Kr�I)a's activities are 
different from others. The best policy is to follow the principles of Kr�Qa; 
that will make one perfect. It is also stated that there is no one who is 
master of Kr�J)a; everyone is His servant. Only Kr�J)a is God, and everyone 
is servant. Everyone is complying with His order. There is no one who can 
deny His order. Everyone is acting according to His direction, being under 
His superintendence. As stated in the Brahma-samhitii, He is the cause of 
all causes.

Kr�lJ.a's devotees relate to Kr�lJ.a in various relationships; one might 
treat Kr�lJ.a as a son, one might treat Kr�lJ.a as a husband, as a friend, as a 
master, etc. Kr�lJ.a and Arjuna are related in friendship. As the father 
tolerates, or the husband or master tolerates, so Kr�lJ.a tolerates.

TRANSLATION 
After seeing this universal form, which I have never seen before, I am 
gladdened, hut at the same time my mind is disturbed with fear. Therefore 
please bestow Your grace upon me and reveal again Your form as the 
Personality of Godhead, 0 Lord of lords, 0 abode of the universe. 
PURPORT 
Aijuna is always in confidence with Kr�va because he is a very dear 
friend, and as a dear friend is gladdened by his friend's opulence, Aijuna 
is very joyful to see that his friend, Kr�va, is the Supreme Personality of 
Godhead and can show such a wonderful universal form. But at the same 
time, after seeing that universal form, he is afraid that he has committed so 
many offenses to Kr�va out of his unalloyed friendship. Thus his mind is 
disturbed out of fear, although he had no reason to fear. Aijuna therefore 
is asking Kr�va to show His Narayava form because He can assume any 
form. This universal form is material and temporary, as the material world 
is temporary. But in the Vaikuvtha planets He has His transcendent;ll 
form with four hands as Narayar;ta. There are innumerable planets in the 
spiritual sky, and in each of them Kr�va is present by His plenary manifes­
tations of different names. Thus Aijuna desired to see one of the forms 
manifest in the V aikuvtha planets. Of course in each V aikuvtha planet the 
form of Narayava is four-handed, and the four hands hold different sym­
bols, the conchshell, mace, lotus and disc. According to the different hands 
these four things are held in, the Narayavas are named. All of these forms 
are one and the same to Kr�va; therefore Aijuna requests to see His four­
handed feature.

0 universal Lord, I wish to see You in Your four-armed form, with

I long to see You in that form. 
PURPORT 
In the Brahma-samhitii it is stated that the Lord is eternally situated in 
hundreds and thousands of forms, and the main forms are those like 
Rama, Nrsimha, NarayaQ.a, etc. There are innumerable forms. But A�una 
knew that Kn;JJ.a is the original Personality of Godhead assuming His 
temporary universal form. He is now asking to see the form of NarayaQ.a, a 
spiritual form. This verse establishes without any doubt the statement of 
the Srimad-Bhiigavatam that Krwa is the original Personality of Godhead 
and all other features originate from Him. He is not different from His 
plenary expansions, and He is God in any of His innumerable forms. In all 
of these forms He is fresh like a young man. That is the constant feature 
of the Supreme Personality .of Godhead. One who knows Kr�JJ.a at once 
becomes free from all contamination of the material world.

TRANSLATION 
The Blessed Lord said: My dear Arjuna, happily do I show you this 
universal form within the material world by My internal potency. No one 
before you has ever seen this unlimited and glaringly effulgent form. 
PURPORT 
Aijuna wanted to see the universal form of the Supreme Lord, so out of 
His mercy upon His devotee Arjuna, Lord Kr�J).a showed His universal 
form full of effulgence and opulence. This form was glaring like the sun, 
and its many faces were rapidly changing. Kr�J).a showed this form just to 
satisfy the desire of His friend Arjuna. This form was manifested by Kr�J).a 
through His internal potency, which is inconceivable by human speculation. 
No one had seen this universal form of the Lord before Arjuna, but because 
the form was shown to Aijuna, other devotees in the heavenly planets and 
in other planets in outer space could also see it. They did not see it before, 
but because of Arjuna they were also able to see it. In other words, all the 
disciplic devotees of the Lord could see the universal form which was 
shown to Aijuna by the mercy of Kr�J).a. Someone commented that this 
form was shown to Duryodhana also when Kr�J).a went to Duryodhana to 
negotiate for peace. Unfortunately, Duryodhana did not accept the peace 
offer, but at that time Kr�J).a manifested some of His universal forms. But 
those forms are different from this one shown to Aijuna. It is clearly said 
that no one has ever seen this form before.

0 best of the Kuru warriors, no one before you has ever seen this 
universal form of Mine, for neither by studying the Vedas, nor by per­
forming sacrifices, nor by charities or similar activities can this form he 
seen. Only you have seen this. 
PURPORT 
The divine vision in this connection should be clearly understood. Who 
em have divine vision? Divine means godly. Unless one attains the status 
of divinity as a demigod, he cannot have divine vision. And what is a 
demigod? It is stated in the Vedic scriptures that those who are devotees 
of Lord Vi�l).U are demigods. Those who are atheistic, i.e., who do not be-· 
lieve in Vi�l).U, or who only recognize the impersonal part of Kr�l).a as the 
Supreme, cannot have the divine vision. It is not possible to decry Kr�I]a 
and at the same time have the divine vision. One cannot have the divine 
vision without becoming divine. In other words, those who have divine 
vision can also see like Arj una. 
Text 48] 
The Universal Form 
581 
The Bhagavad-gitii gives the description of the universal form, and this 
description was unknown to everyone before Arjuna. Now one can have 
some idea of the visva-rfipa after this incidence; those who are actually 
divine can see the universal form of the Lord. But one cannot be divine 
without being a pure devotee of Krg1a. The devotees, however, who are 
actually in the divine nature and who have divine vision, are not very much 
interested to see the universal form of the Lord. As described in the pre­
vious verse, Arjuna desired to see the four-handed form of Lord Kr�l).a as 
Vi�l).U, and he was actually afraid of the universal form. 
In this verse there are some significant words, just like veda-yajiiiidhya­
yana*, which refers to studying Vedic literature and the subject matter of 
sacrificial regulations. Veda refers to all kinds of Vedic literature, namely 
the four Vedas (.({k, Yajus, Siima and A tharva) and the eighteen Puriipas 
and Upani�ads, and Vediinta-siitra. One can study these at home or any­
where else. Similarly, there are siitras, Kalpa-siitras and Mimiimsii-siitras, 
for studying the method of sacrifice. Diina* refers to charity which is 
offered to a suitable party, such as those who are engaged in the transcen­
dental loving service of the Lord, the briihmapas and the Vaigwvas. Similar­
ly, pious activities refer to the agni-hotra, etc., the prescribed duties of the 
different castes. Pious activities and the voluntary acceptance of some bodily 
pains are called tapasya. So one can perform all these, can accept bodily 
penances, give charity, study the Vedas, etc., but unless he is a devotee 
like Arjuna, it is not possible to see that universal form. Those who are 
impersonalists are also imagining that they are seeing the universal form 
of the Lord, but from Bhagavad-gitii we understand that the impersonalist� 
are not devotees. Therefore they are unable to see the universal form of 
the Lord. 
There are many persons who create incarnations. They falsely claim an 
ordinary human to be an incarnation, but this is all foolishness. We should 
follow the principles of Bhagavad-gitii, otherwise there is no possibility of 
attaining perfect spiritual knowledge. Although Bhagavad-gitii is considered 
the preliminary study of the science of God, still it is so perfect that one 
can distinguish what is what. The followers of a pseudo incarnation may 
say that they have also seen the transcendental incarnation of God, the 
universal form, but that is not acceptable because it is clearly stated here 
that unless one becomes a devotee of Kr�l).a, one cannot see the universal 
form of God. So one first of all has to become a pure devotee of Kr�l).a; 
then he can claim that he can show the universal form of what he has seen. 
A devotee of Kr�l).a cannot accept false incarnations or followers of false 
incarnations.

PURPORT 
In the beginning of Bhagavad-gitii Arjuna was worried about killing 
Bh1�ma and Dror;ta, his worshipful grandfathers and masters. But Kr�r;ta 
·said that he need not be afraid of killing his grandfather. When they tried 
to disrobe Draupad1 in the assembly, Bhl�ma and Dror;ta were silent, and 
for such negligence of duty they should be killed. Kr�r;ta showed His uni­
versal form to Arjuna just to show him that these people were already 
killed for their unlawful action. That scene was shown to Arjuna because 
devotees are always peaceful, and they cannot perform such horrible 
actions. The purpose of the revelation of the universal form was shown; 
now Arjuna wanted to see the four-armed form, and Kp�r;ta showed him. A 
devotee is not much interested in the universal form, for it does not en­
able one to reciprocate loving feelings. A devotee wants to offer his 
Text 50) 
The Universal F onn 
583 
respectful worshiping feelings; thus he wants to see the two-handed or 
four-handed Kr�:va form so he can reciprocate in loving service with the 
Supreme Personality of Godhead.

Saiijaya said to Dhrtar�tra: The Supreme Personality of Godhead, 
Kr�:va, while speaking thus to Arjuna, displayed His real four-armed form, 
and at last He showed him His two-armed form, thus encouraging the 
fearful Arjuna. 
PURPORT 
When Kr�:va appeared as the son of Vasudeva and Devakl, He first of all 
appeared as four-armed Naraya:va, but when He was requested by His 
parents, He transformed Himself into an ordinary child in appearance. 
Similarly, Kr�:va knew that Arjuna was not interested in seeing a four­
handed form of Kr�:va, but since he asked to see this four-handed form, 
J' 
584 
Bhagavad-glta As It Is 
[Ch. 11 
He also showed him this form again and then showed Himself in His two­
handed form. The word saumya-vapu� is very significant. Saumya-vapu is 
a very beautiful form; it is known as the most beautiful form. When He 
was present, everyone was attracted simply by Kr�Q.a's form, and because 
Kr�Q.a is director of the universe, He just banished the fear of Aijuna, His 
devotee, and showed him again His beautiful form of Kr�Q.a. In the Brahma­
samhitii it is stated that only a person whose eyes are smeared with the 
ointment of love can see the beautiful form of Sri Kr�Q.a.

When Arjuna thus saw Kr�Q.a in His original form, he said: Seeing this 
humanlike form, so very beautiful, my mind is now pacified, and I am 
restored to my original nature. 
PURPORT 
Here the words mtinu§am rilpam clearly indicate the Supreme Person­
ality of Godhead to be originally two-handed .. Those who deride Kr�Q.a to 
be an ordinary person are shown here to be ignorant of His divine nature. 
If Kn;Q.a is like an ordinary human being, then how is it possible for Him 
Text 52] 
The Universal Form 
585 
to show the universal form and again to show the four-handed Narayava 
form? So it is very clearly stated in Bhagavad-gitii that one who thinks 
that Kr�va is an ordinary person and misguides the reader by claiming that 
it is the impersonal Brahman within Kr�va speaking, is doing the greatest 
injustice. Kr�va has actually shown His universal form and His four­
handed Vi�vu form. So how can He be an ordinary human being? A pure 
devotee is not confused by misguiding commentaries on Bhagavad-gitii 
because he knows what is what. The original verses of Bhagavad-gitii 
are as clear as the sun; they do not require lamplight from foolish 
commentators.

TRANSLATION 
The Blessed Lord said: My dear Aijuna, the form which you are now 
seeing is very difficult to behold. Even the demigods are ever seeking the 
opportunity to see this form which is so dear. 
PURPORT 
In the forty-eighth verse of this chapter Lord Kr�va concluded revealing 
His universal form and informed Aijuna that this form is not possible to 
586 
Bhagavad-gita As It Is 
[Ch. 11 
be seen by so many activities, 
sacrifices, 
etc. 
Now here the word 
sudurdarsam is used, indicating that Kr�l).a's two-handed form is still more 
confidential. One may be able to see the universal form of Kr�l).a by 
adding a little tinge of devotional service to various activities like penance, 
Vedic study and philosophical speculation, etc. It may be possible, but 
without a tinge of bhakti, one cannot see; that has already been explained. 
Still, beyond that universal form, the form of Kr�l).a as a two-handed man 
is still more difficult to see, even for demigods like Brahma and Lord 
Siva. They desire to see Him, and we have evidences in the Srimad­
Bhiigavatam that when He was supposed to be in the womb of His mother, 
Devaki, all the demigods from heaven came to see the marvel of Kr�l).a. 
They even waited to see Him. A foolish person may deride Him, but that 
is an ordinary person. Kr�l).a is actually desired to be seen by demigods like 
Brahma and Siva in His two-armed form. 
In Bhagavad-gitii it is also confirmed that He is not visible to the foolish 
persons who deride Him. Kr�l).a's body, as confirmed by Brahma-samhitii 
and confirmed by Himself in Bhagavad-gitii, is completely spiritual and full 
of bliss and eternality. His body is never like a material body. But for 
some who make a study of Kr�l).a by reading Bhagavad-gitii or similar 
Vedic scriptures, Kr�l).a is a problem. For one using a material process, 
Kr�l).a is considered to be a great historical personality and very learned 
philosopher. But He isn't an ordinary man. But some think that even 
though He was so powerful, He had to accept a material body. Ultimately 
they think that the Absolute Truth is impersonal; therefore they think 
that from His Impersonal feature He assumed a personal feature attached 
to material nature. This is a materialistic calculation of the Supreme Lord. 
Another calculation is speculative. Those who are. in search of knowledge 
also speculate on Kr�l).a and consider Him to be less important than the 
universal form of the Supreme. Thus some think that the universal form 
of Kr�l).a which was manifested to Arjuna is more important than His 
personal form. According to them, the personal form of the Supreme is 
something imaginary. They believe that in the ultimate issue, the Absolute 
Truth is not a person. But the transcendental process is described in 
Bhagavad-gitii, Chapter Two: to hear about Kr�l).a from authorities. That 
is the actual Vedic process, and those who are actually in the Vedic line 
hear about Kr�l).a from authority, and by repeated hearing about Him, 
Kr�l).a'becomes dear. As we have several times discussed, Kn;l).a is covered 
by His yoga-miiyii potency. He is not to be seen or revealed to anyone and 
everyone. Only by one to whom He reveals Himself can He be seen. This 
is confirmed in Vedic literature; for one who is a surrendered soul, the 
Text 53] 
The Universal Form 
587 
Absolute Truth can actually be understood. The transcendentalist, by 
continuous K�I;ta consciousness and by devotional service to Kn>I;ta, can 
have his spiritual eyes opened and can see Kr�I;ta by revelation. Such a 
revelation is not possible even for the demigods; therefore it is difficult 
even for the demigods to understand Kn;I;ta, and the advanced demigods 
are always in hope of seeing Kr�I;ta in His two-handed form. The conclusion 
is that although to see the universal form of Kn;I;ta is very, very difficult 
and not possible for anyone and everyone, it is still more difficult to 
understand His personal form as Syamasundara.

Kr�I;ta first appeared before His parents Devaki and Vasudeva in a four­
handed form, and then He transformed Himself into the two-handed form. 
This mystery is very difficult to understand for those who are atheists or 
who are devoid of devotional service. For scholars who have simply 
studied Vedic literature by way of speculation or out of mere academic

persons who officially go to the temple to offer worship. They rnake their 
visit, but they cannot understand Kr�l).a as He is. Kr�l).a can be understood 
only through the path of devotional service, as explained by Kr�l).a Him­
self in the next verse.

My dear Arjuna, only by undivided devotional service can I be under­

PURPORT 
Kr�l).a can be understood only by the process of undivided devotional 
service. He explicitly explains this in this verse so unauthorized commen­
tators, who try to understand Bhagavad-gitii by the speculative process, 
will know that they are simply wasting their time. No one can understand 
Kr�l).a or how He came from parents in a four-handed form and at once 
changed Himself into a two-handed form. It is clearly stated here that 
no one can see Him. Those who, however, are very experienced students of 
Vedic literature can learn about Him from the Vedic literature in so many 
ways. There are so many rules and regulations, and if one at all wants to 
understand Kr�l).a, he must follow the regulative principles described in 
t 
�. 
Text 54] 
The Universal Form 
589 
the authoritative literature. One can perform penance in accordance with 
those principles. As far as charity is concerned, it is plain that charity 
should be given to the devotees of Kr�l).a who are engaged in His devotional 
service to spread the Kr�l).a philosophy or Kr�l).a consciousness throughout 
the world. Kr�qa consciousness is a benediction to humanity. Lord 
Caitanya was appreciated by Rupa Gosvami as the most munificent man 
of charity because love of Kr�l).a, which is very difficult to achieve, was 
distributed freely by Him. And if one worships as prescribed in the temple 
(in the temples in India there is always some statue, usually of Vi�l).u or 
Kg;l).a), that is a chance to progress. For the beginners in devotional 
service to the Lord, temple worship is very essential, and this is confirmed 
in the Vedic literature. 
One who has unflinching devotion for the Supreme Lord and is directed 
by the spiritual master can see the Supreme Personality of Godhead by 
revelation. For one who does not take personal training under the guidance 
of a bona fide spiritual master, it is impossible to even begin to understand 
Kr�l).a. The word tu is specifically used here to indicate that no other 
process can be used, can be recommended, or can be successful in under­
standing Kr�l).a. 
The personal forms of Kr�l).a, the two-handed form and the four­
handed, are completely different from the temporary universal form shown 
to Arjuna. The four-handed form is Narayal).a, and the two-handed form 
is Kr�l).a; they are eternal and transcendental, whereas the universal form 
exhibited to Arjuna is temporary. The very word sudurdarsam, meaning 
difficult to see, suggests that no one saw that universal form. It also 
suggests that amongst the devotees there was no necessity of showing it. 
That form was exhibited by Kr�l).a at the request of Arjuna because in the 
future, when one represents himself as an incarnation of God, people can 
ask to see his universal form. 
Kr�l).a changes from the universal form to the four-handed form of 
Narayal).a and then to His own natural form of two hands. This indicates 
that the four-handed forms and other forms mentioned in Vedic literature 
are all emanations of the original two-handed Kr�l).a. He is the origin of all 
emanations. Kr�l).a is distinct even from these forms, not to speak of the 
impersonal conception. As far as the four-handed forms of Kr�l).a are con­
cerned, it is stated clearly that even the most identical four-handed form 
of Kr�l).a (which is known as Maha-Vi�l).u, who is lying on the cosmic ocean 
and from whose breathing so many innumerable universes are passing out 
and entering) is also an expansion of the Supreme Lord. Therefore one 
should conclusively worship the personal form of Kr�l).a as the Supreme 
590 
Bhagavad-glta As It Is 
[Ch. 11 · 
Personality of Godhead who is eternity, bliss and knowledge. He is the 
source of all forms of Vi�I).u, He is the source of all forms of incarnation, 
and He is the original Supreme Personality, as confirmed in Bhagavad-gitii. 
In the Vedic literature it is stated that the Supreme Absolute Truth is a 
person. His name is Kr�I).a, and He sometimes descends on this earth. 
Similarly, in Srimad-Bhiigavatam there is a description of all kinds of 
incarnations of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and there it is said 
that Kr�I).a is not an incarnation of God but is the original Supreme Person­
ality of Godhead Himself. Kmws tu bhagaviin svayam. Similarly, in 
Bhagavad-gitii the Lord says, matta� parataram niinyiit: "There is nothing 
superior to My form as the Personality of Godhead Kr�I).a." He also says 
elsewhere in Bhagavad-gitii, aham iidir hi deviiniim: "I am the origin of all 
the demigods." And after understanding Bhagavad"gftii from Kr�va, Arjuna 
also confirms this in the following words: param brahma param dhiima 
pavitram paramam bhaviin: "I now fully understand that You are the 
Supreme Personality of Godhead, the Absolute Truth, and that You are 
the refuge of everything." Therefore the universal form which Kr�va 
showed to Arjuna is not the original form 0f God. The original is the 
Kr�va form. The universal form, with its thousands and thousands of 
heads and hands, is manifest just to draw the attention of those who have 
no love for God. It is not God's original form. 
The universal form is not attractive for pure devotees, who are in love 
with the Lord in different transcendental relationships. The Supreme 
Godhead exchanges transcendental love in His original form of Kr�va. 
Therefore to Arjuna, who was so intimately related with Kr�J}.a in friend­
ship, this form of the universal manifestation was not pleasing; rather, it 
was fearful. Arjuna, who is a constant companion of Kr�va's, must have 
had transcendental eyes; he was not an ordinary man. Therefore he was 
not captivated by the universal form. This form may seem wonderful to 
persons who are involved in elevating themselves by fruitive activities, but 
to persons who are engaged in devotional service, the two-handed form of 
Kr�I).a is the most dear.

My dear Arjuna, one who is engaged in My pure devotional service, free 
from the contaminations of previous activities and from mental specula­
tion, who is friendly to every living entity, certainly comes to Me. 
PURPORT 
Anyone who wants to approach the Supreme of all the Personalities of 
Godhead, on the Kr�IJ.aloka planet in the spiritual sky, and be intimately 
connected with the Supreme Personality, K�JJ.a, must take this formula, 
as is stated by the Supreme Himself. Therefore, this verse is considered to 
be the essence of Bhagavad-gitii. The Bhagavad-gitii is a book directed to the 
conditioned souls, who are engaged in the material world with the purpose 
of lording it over nature and who do not know of the real, spiritual life. 
The Bhagavad-gitii is meant to show how one can understand his spiritual 
existence and his eternal relationship with the Supreme Spiritual Person­
ality and to teach one how to go back home, back to Godhead. Now here 
is the verse which clearly explains the process by which one can attain suc­
cess in his spiritual activity: devotional service. As far as work is concerned, 
one should transfer his energy entirely to Kr�Q.a conscious activities. No 
work should be done by any man except in relationship to K�JJ.a. This is 
called K�l).a-karma. One may be engaged in various activities, but one 
should not be attached to the result of his work, but the result should be 
done for Him. For example, one may be engaged in business, but to trans­
form that activity into Krg1a consciousness, one has to do business for 
Kr�Q.a. If Kr�Q.a is the proprietor of the business, then K�Q.a should enjoy 
the profit of the business. If a businessman is in possession of thousands 
and thousands of dollars, and if he has to offer all this to KnQ.a, he can do 
it. This is work for Kr�Q.a. Instead of constructing a big building for his 
l 
li 
592 
Bhagavad-glta As It Is 
[Ch. 11 
sense gratification, he can co�struct a nice temple for Kr�Q.a, and he can 
install the Deity of Kr�Q.a and arrange for the Deity's service, as is outlined 
in the authorized books of devotional service. This is all Kr�Q.a-karma. One 
should not be attached to the result of his work, but the result should be 
offered to Kr�IJa. One should also accept as prasiidam, food, the remnants 
of offerings to Kr�IJa. If, however, one is not able to construct a temple for 
Kr�IJa, one can engage himself in cleansing the temple of Kr�Q.a; that is also 
Kr�Q.a -karma. One can cultivate a garden. Anyone who has land-in India, 
at least, any poor man has a certain amount of land-can utilize that for 
Krgta by growing flowers to offer Him. He can sow tulasi plants because 
tulasi leaves are very important, and Kr�IJa has recommended this in 
Bhagavad-gitii. Kr�Q.a desires that one offer Him either a leaf, or a flower, 
or a little water-and He is satisfied. This leaf especially refers to the tulasi. 
So one can sow tulasi leaves and pour water on the plant. Thus, even the 
poorest man can engage in the service of Kr�IJa. These are some of the 
examples of how one can engage in working for Kr�l).a. 
The word mat-parama� refers to one who considers the association of 
Kr�l).a in His supreme abode to be the highest perfection of life. Such a 
person does not wish to be elevated to the higher planets such as the moon 
or sun or heavenly planets, or even the highest planet of this universe, 
Brahmaloka. He has no attraction for that. He is only attracted to being 
transferred to the spiritual sky. And even in the spiritual sky he is not 
satisfied with merging into the glowing brahmajyoti effulgence, for he 
wants to enter the highest spiritual planet, namely Kr�Q.aloka, Goloka 
Vrndavana. He has full knowledge of that planet, and therefore he is not 
interested in any other. As indicated by the word mad-bhakta�, he fully 
engages in devotional service, specifically in the nine processes of devotion­
al engagement: hearing, chanting, remembering, worshiping, serving the 
lotus feet of the Lord, offering prayers, carrying out the orders of the 
Lord, making friends with Him, and surrendering everything to Him. One 
can engage in all nine devotional processes, or eight, or seven, or at least 
in one, and that will surely make one perfect. 
The term sanga-varjita� is very significant. One should disassociate 
himself from persons who are against Kr�IJa. Not only are the atheistic 
persons against Kr�Q.a, but also those who are attracted to 
fruitive 
activities and mental speculation. Therefore the pure form of devotional 
service is described in Bhakti-rasiimrta-sindhu as follows: anyiibhilii§itii­
siinyam 
jiiiina-kanniidy-aniivrtam 
iinukiilyena 
krrriinusilanam 
bhaktir 
uttamii. In this verse Snla Rilpa Gosvami clearly states that if anyone wants 
to execute unalloyed devotional service, he must be freed from all kinds 
li 
Text 55] 
The Universal Form 
593 
of material contamination. He must be freed from the association of 
persons who are addicted to fruitive activities and mental speculation. 
When, freed from such unwanted association and from the contamination 
of material desires, one favorably cultivates knowledge of Kr�D-a, that is 
called pure devotional service. Anukiilyasya sankaplal) priitikiilyasya varja­
nam. One should think of Kr�pa and act for Kr�pa favorably, not unfavorab­
ly: Kamsa was an enemy of Kr�D-a's. From the very beginning of Kr�D-a's 
birth, he planned in so many ways to kill Him, and because he was always 
unsuccessful, he was always thinking of Kr�D-a. Thus while working, while 
eating and while sleeping, he was always Kr�D-a conscious in every respect, 
but that Kr�r;ta consciousness was not favorable, and therefore in spite of 
his always thinking of Kr�D-a twenty-four hours a day, he was considered a 
demon, and Kr�D-a at last killed him. Of course anyone who is killed by 
Kr�D-a attains salvation immediately, but that is not the aim of the pure 
devotee. The pure devotee does not even want salvation. He does not want 
to be transferred even to the highest planet, Goloka V rndavana. His only 
objective is to serve Kr�IJa wherever he may be. 
A devotee of Kr�r;ta is friendly to everyone. Therefore it is said here that 
he has no enemy. How is this? A devotee situated in Kr�qa consciousness 
knows that only devotional service to Kr�r;ta can relieve a person from all 
the problems of life. He has personal experience of this, and therefore he 
wants to introduce this system, Kr�r;ta consciousness, into human society. 
There are many examples in history of devotees of the Lord risking their 
lives for the spreading of God consciousness. The favorite example is Lord 
Jesus Christ. He was crucified by the nondevotees, but He sacrificed His 
life for spreading God consciousness. Of course, it would be superficial to 
understand that He was killed. Similarly, in India also there are many 
examples, such as Thakur Haridasa. Why such risk? Because they wanted to 
spread Kr�r;ta consciousness, and it is difficult. A Kr�D-a conscious person 
knows that if a man is suffering, it is due to his forgetfulness of his eternal 
relationship with Kr�r;ta. Therefore, the highest benefit one can render to 
human society is relieving one's neighbor from all material problems. In 
such a way, a pure devotee is engaged in the service of the Lord. Now, we 
can imagine how merciful Kr�r;ta is to those engaged in His service, risking 
everything for Him. Therefore it is certain that such persons must reach 
the supreme planet after leaving the body. 
In summary, the universal form of Kr�r;ta, which is a temporary mani­
festation, and the form of time which devours everything, and even the 
form of Vi�r;tu, four-handed, have all been exhibited by Kr�r;ta. Thus 
Kr�r;ta is the origin of all these manifestations. It is not that Kr�JJ.a is a 
594 
Bhagavad-gita As It Is 
[Ch. 11· 
manifestation of the original viSva-rilpa, or Vi�J)U. Kr�J)a is the origin of all 
forms. There are hundreds and thousands of Vi�J)us, but for a devotee, no 
form 
of 
Kr�J)a 
is 
important 
but 
the 
original form, two-handed 
Syamasundara. In the Brahma-samhita it is stated that those who are 
attached to the Syimasundara form of Kr�J)a in love and devotion can see 
Him always within the heart and cannot see anything else. One should 
understand, therefore, that the purport of this Eleventh Chapter is th;tt 
the form of Kr�J)a is essential and supreme. 
Thus end the Bhaktivedanta Purports to the Eleventh Chapter of the 
Srimad-Bhagavad-gita in the matter of the Universal Form.

TRANSLATION 
Arjuna inquired: Which is considered to he more perfect: those who 
are properly engaged in Your devotional service, or those who worship the 
impersonal Brahman, the unmanifested? 
PURPORT 
Kr�I).a has now explained about the personal, the impersonal and the 
universal and has described all kinds of devotees and yogis. Generally, the 
transcendentalists can he divided into two classes. One is the impersonalist, 
and the other is the personalist. The personalist devotee engages himself 
with all energy in the service of the Supreme Lord. The impersonalist 
engages himself not directly in the service of Kr�I).a hut in meditation on 
the impersonal Brahman, the unmanifested. 
We find in this chapter that of the different processes for realization of 
the Absolute Truth, bhakti-yoga, devotional service, is the highest. If one 
at all desires to have the association of the Supreme Personality of God­
head, then he must take to devotional service. 
Those who worship the Supreme Lord directly by devotional service are 
called personalists. Those who engage themselves in meditation on the 
impersonal Brahman are called impersonalists. Arjuna is here questioning 
which position is better. There are different ways to realize the Absolute 
Truth, but Kr�I).a indicates in this chapter that bhakti-yoga, or devotional 
service to Him, is highest of all. It is the most direct, and it is the easiest 
means for association with the Godhead. 
In the Second Chapter the Lord explains that a living entity is not the 
material body but is a spiritual spark, a part of the Absolute Truth. In the 
Seventh Chapter He speaks of the living entity as part and parcel of the 
supreme whole and recommends that he transfer his attention fully to the 
whole. In the Eighth Chapter it is stated that whoever thinks of Kr�I).a at 
the moment of death is at once transferred to the spiritual sky, Kr�I).a's 
abode. And at the end of the Sixth Chapter the Lord says that out of all 
the yogis, he who thinks of Kr�I).a within himself is considered to he the 
most perfect. So throughout the Gitii personal devotion to Kr�I).a is recom­
mended as the highest form of spiritual realization. Yet there are those who 
are still attracted to Kr�I).a's impersonal brahmajyoti effulgence, which is 
the all-pervasive aspect of the Absolute Truth and which is unmanifest and 
beyond the reach of the senses. Arjuna would like to know which of these 
two types of transcendentalists is more perfect in knowledge. In other 
words, he is clarifying his own position because he is attached to the 
Text 2) 
Devotional Service 
597 
personal form of Kr�J).a. He is not attached to the impersonal Brahman. He 
wants to know whether his position is secure. The impersonal manifesta­
tion, either in this material world or in the spiritual world of the Supreme 
Lord, is a problem for meditation. Actually, one cannot perfectly conceive 
of the impersonal feature of the Absolute Truth. Therefore Arjuna wants 
to say, "What is the use of such a waste of time?" Arjuna experienced in 
the Eleventh Chapter that to be attached to the personal form of Kr�Q.a is 
best because he could thus understand all other forms at the same time and 
there was no disturbance to his love for Kr�J).a. This important question 
asked of Kr�J).a by Arjuna will clarify the distinction between the imper­
sonal and personal conceptions of the Absolute Truth.

tion is to be considered most perfect in yoga. For one in such Kr�J)a con­
sciousness there are no material activities because everything is done by 
Kr�J)a. A pure devotee is constantly engaged-sometimes he chants, some­
times he hears or reads books about Kr�J)a, or sometimes he cooks prasii­
dam or goes to the marketplace to purchase something for Kr�J)a, or some­
times he washes the temple or the dishes-whatever he does, he does not 
let a single moment pass without devoting his activities to Kr�J)a. Such 
action is in full samiidhi.

PURPORT 
Those who do not directly worship the Supreme Godhead, Kn;J;la, but 
who attempt to achieve the same goal by an indirect process, also ultimate­
ly achieve the supreme goal� Sri Krwa, as is stated, "After many births 
the man of wisdom seeks refuge in Me, knowing Vasudeva is all." When a 
person comes to full knowledge after many births, he surrenders unto Lord 
Kr�I]a. If one approaches the Godhead by the method mentioned in this 
verse, he has to control the senses, render service to everyone and engage 
in the welfare of all beings. It is inferred that one has to approach Lord 
Kr�J;la, otherwise there is no perfect realization. Often there is much 
penance involved before one fully surrenders unto Him. 
In order to perceive the Supersoul within the individual soul, one has to 
cease the sensual activities of seeing, hearing, tasting, working, etc. Then 
one comes to understand that the Supreme Soul is present everywhere. 
Realizing this, one envies no living entity-he sees no difference between 
man and animal because he sees soul only, not the outer covering. But for 
the common man, this method of impersonal realization is very difficult.

For those whose minds are attached to the unmanifested, impersonal

600 
Bhagavad-gita As It Is 
[Ch. 12 
PURPORT 
The group of transcendentalists who follow the path of the inconceiv­
able, unmanifested, impersonal feature of the Supreme Lord are called 
jniina-yogis, and persons who are in full Kr�l)a consciousness, engaged in 
devotional service to the Lord, are called bhakti-yogis. Now, here the dif­
ference between jniina-yoga and bhakti-yoga is definitely expressed. The 
process of jniina-yoga, although ultimately bringing one to the same goal, 
is very troublesome, whereas the path of bhakti-yoga, the process of being 
in direct service to the Supreme Personality of Godhead, is easier and is 
natural for the embodied soul. The individual soul is embodied since time 
immemorial. It is very difficult for him to simply theoretically understand 
that he is not the body. Therefore, the bhakti-yogi accepts the Deity of 
Kr�l)a as worshipable because there is some bodily conception fixed in the 
mind, which can thus be applied. Of course, worship of the Supreme 
Personality of Godhead in His form within the temple is not idol worship. 
There is evidence in the Vedic literature that worship may be sagura and 
nirgura-of
. the Supreme possessing or not possessing attributes. Worship 
of the Deity in the temple is sagura worship, for the Lord is represented 
by material qualities. But the form of the Lord, though represented by 
material qualities such as stone, wood, or oil paint, is not actually material. 
That is the absolute nature of the Supreme Lord. 
A crude example may be given here. We may find some mailboxes on 
the street, and if we post our letters in those boxes, they will naturally go 
to their destination without difficulty. But any old box, or an imitation, 
which we may find somewhere, which is not authorized by the post office, 
will not do the work. Similarly, God has an authorized representation in 
the Deity form, which is called arca-vigraha. This arca-vigraha is an incar­
nation of the Supreme Lord. God will accept service through that form. 
The Lord is omnipotent and all-powerful; therefore, by His incarnation as 
arca-vigraha, He can accept the services of the devotee, just to make it con­
venient for the man in conditioned life. 
So, for a devotee, there is no difficulty in approaching the Supreme 
immediately and directly, but for those who are following the impersonal 
way to spiritual realization, the path is difficult. They have to understand 
the unmanifested representation of the Supreme through such Vedic 
literatures as the Upani}ads, and they have to learn the language, under­
stand the nonperceptual feelings, and they have to realize all these 
processes. This is not very easy for a common man. A person in Kr�l)a 
consciousness, engaged in devotional service, simply by the guidance of the

Texts 6-7]

601. 
bona fide spiritual master, simply by offering regulative obeisances unto 
the Deity, simply by hearing the glories of the Lord, and simply by eating 
the remnants of foodstuffs offered to the Lord, realizes the Supreme 
Personality of Godhead very easily. There is no doubt that the imperson­
alists are unnecessarily taking a troublesome path with the risk of not 
realizing the Absolute Truth at the ultimate end. But the personalist, with­
out any risk, trouble, or difficulty, approaches the Supreme Personality 
directly. A similar passage appears in Srimad-Bhiigavatam. It is stated there 
that if one has to ultimately surrender unto the Supreme Personality of 
Godhead (This surrendering process is called bhakti.), but instead takes the 
trouble to understand what is Brahman and what is not Brahman and 
spends his whole life in that way, the result is simply troublesome. There­
fore it is advised here that one should not take up this troublesome path of 
self-realization because there is uncertainty in the ultimate result. 
A living entity is eternally an individual soul, and if he wants to merge 
into. the spiritual whole, he may accomplish the realization of the eternal 
and knowledgeable aspects of his original nature, but the blissful portion 
is not realized. By the grace of some devotee, such a transcendentalist, 
highly learned in the process of jiiiina-yoga, may come to the point of 
bhakti-yoga, or devotional service. At that time, long practice in imperson­
alism also becomes a source of trouble, because he cannot give up the idea. 
Therefore an embodied soul is always in difficulty with the unmanifest, 
both at the time of practice and at the time of realization. Every living 
soul is partially independent, and one should know for certain that this. 
unmanifested realization is against the nature of his spiritual blissful 
self. One should not take up this process. For every individual living 
entity the process of Kr�l)a consciousness, which entails full engagement in 
devotional service, is the best way. If one wants to ignore this devotional 
service, there is the danger of turning to atheism. Thus this process of 
centering attention on the unmanifested, the inconceivable, which is 
beyond the approach of the senses, as already expressed in this verse, 
should never be encouraged at any time, especially in this age. It is not 
advised by Lord Kr�l)a.

For one who worships Me, giving up all his activities unto Me and being 
devoted to Me without deviation, engaged in devotional service and always 
meditating upon Me, who has fixed his mind upon Me, 0 son of Prtha, for 
him I am the swift deliverer from the ocean of birth and death. 
PURPORT 
It is explicitly stated here that the devotees are very fortunate to be 
delivered very soon from material existence by the Lord. In pure devo­
tional service one comes to the realization that God is great and that the 
individual soul is subordinate to Him. His duty is to render service to the 
Lord-if not, then he will render service to miiyii. 
As stated before, the Supreme Lord can only be appreciated by devotion­
al service. Therefore, one should be fully devoted. One should fix his mind 
fully on Kr�Qa in order to achieve Him. One should work only for Kr�Qa. It 
does not matter in what kind of work one engages, but that work should 
be done only for Kr�Qa. That. is the standard of devotional service. The 
Texts 6-7] 
Devotional Service 
603 
devotee does not desire any achievement other than pleasing the Supreme 
Personality of Godhead. His life's mission is to please Kr�Q.a, and he can 
sacrifice everything for Kr�Q.a's satisfaction, just as Arjuna did in the 
Battle of Kuruk�etra. The process is very simple: one can devote himself in 
his occupation and engage at the same time in chanting Hare Kr�Q.a, Hare 
Kr�Q.a, Kr�Q.a Kr�Q.a, Hare Hare/ Hare Rama, Hare Rama, Rama Rama, 
Hare Hare. Such transcendental chanting attracts the devotee to the 
Personality of Godhead. 
The Supreme Lord herein promises that He will without delay deliver 
a pure devotee thus engaged from the ocean of material existence. Those 
who are advanced in yoga practice can willfully transfer the soul to what­
ever planet they like by the yoga process, and others take the opportunity 
in various ways, but as far as the devotee is concerned, it is clearly stated 
here that the Lord Himself takes him. He does not need to wait to become 
very experienced in order to transfer himself to the spiritual sky. 
In the Variiha Puriirw this verse appears: 
nayiimi paramarh sthiinam arciriidi-gatirh vinii 
ganu}.a-skandham iiropya yatheccham aniviirita� 
The purport of this verse is that a devotee does not need to practice 
a§tiinga-yoga in order to transfer his soul to the spiritual planets. The 
responsibility is taken by the Supreme Lord Himself. He clearly states 
here that He Himself becomes the deliverer. A child is completely cared 
for by his parents, and thus his position is secure. Similarly, a devotee 
does not need to endeavor to transfer himself by yoga practice to other 
planets. Rather, the Supreme Lord, by His great mercy, comes at once, 
riding on His bird carrier GarutJa, and at once delivers the devotee from 
this material existence. Although a man who has fallen in the ocean may 
struggle very hard and may be very expert in swimming, he cannot save 
himself. But if someone comes and picks him up from the water, then he 
is easily rescued. Similarly, the Lord picks up . the devotee from this 
material existence. One simply has to practice the easy process of Kr�Q.a 
consciousness and fully engage himself in devotional service. Any intelligent 
man should always prefer the process ·of devotional service to all other 
paths. In the Niiriiyaviya this is confirmed as follows: 
yii vai siidhana-sampatti-puru§iirtha-catu�taye 
tayii vinii tad-iipnoti naro niiriiya[liiSraya� 
The purport of this verse is that one should not engage in the different 
processes of fruitive activity or cultivate knowledge by the mental specula-
·•

Bhagavad-glta As It Is 
[Ch. 12 
tive process. One who is devoted to the Supreme Personality can attain all 
the benefits derived from other yogic processes, speculation, rituals, 
sacrifices, charities, etc. That is the specific benediction of devotional 
servtce. 
Simply by chanting the holy name of Kr!?Q.a-Hare Kr!?Q.a, Hare Kr!?Q.a, 
Kg;I).a Kr!?Q.a, Hare Hare/ Hare Rama, Hare Rama, Rama Rama, Hare Hare­
a devotee of the Lord can approach the supreme destination easily and 
happily, but this destination cannot be approached by any other process 
of religion. 
The conclusion of Bhagavad-gitii is stated in the Eighteenth Chapter: 
sarva-dharmiin parityajya miim ekam sarar-am vraja 
aham tviim sarva-piipebhyo mok§ayi§yiimi mii suca[t. 
One should give up all other processes of self-realization and simply exe­
cute devotional service in Kr!?Q.a consciousness. That will enable one to 
reach the highest perfection of life. There is no need for one to consider 
the sinful actions of his past life because the Supreme Lord fully takes 
charge of him. Therefore one should not futilely try to deliver himself in 
spiritual realization. Let everyone take shelter of the supreme omnipotent 
Godhead Kr!?Q.a. That is the highest perfection of life.

Devotional Service 
605 
PURPORT 
One who is engaged in Lord Kw;a's devotional service lives in a direct 
relationship with the Supreme Lord, so there is no doubt that his position 
is transcendental from the very beginning. A devotee does not live on the 
material plane-he lives in Kr�l)a. The holy name of the Lord and the Lord 
are nondifferent; therefore when a devotee chants Hare Kr�l)a, Kr�l)a and 
His internal potency are dancing on the tongue of the devotee. When he 
offers Kr�l)a food, Kr�rya directly accepts these eatables, and the devotee 
becomes Kr�rya-ized by eating the remnants. One who does not engage 
in such service cannot understand how this is so, although this is a 
process recommended in the Gitii and in other Vedic literatures.

My dear Arjuna, 0 winner of wealth, if you cannot fix your mind upon 
Me without deviation, then follow the regulated principles of bhakti-yoga. 
In this way you will develop a desire to attain to Me. 
PURPORT 
In this verse, two different processes of bhakti-yoga are indicated. The 
first applies to one who has actually developed an attachment for Kr�l)a, 
the Supreme Personality of Godhead, by transcendental love. And the 
other is for one who has not developed an attachment for the Supreme 
Person by transcendental love. For this second class there are different 
• 
606 
Bhagavad-gita As It Is 
[Ch. 12 . 
prescribed rules and regulations, which one can follow to be ultimately 
elevated to the stage of attachment to Kr�J).a. 
Bhakti-yoga is the purification of the senses. At the present moment in 
material existence the senses are always impure, being engaged in sense 
gratification. But, by the practice of bhakti-yoga these senses can become 
purified, and in the purified state they come directly in contact with the 
Supreme Lord. In this material existence, I may be engaged in some service 
to some master, but I don't really lovingly serve my master. I simply serve 
to get some money. And the master also is not in love; he takes service 
from me and pays me. So there is no question of love. But for spiritual 
life, one must be elevated to the pure stage of love. That stage of love can 
be achieved by practice of devotional service, performed with the present 
senses. 
This love of God is now in a dormant state in everyone's heart. And, 
there, love of God is manifested in different ways, but it is contaminated 
by the material association. Now the material association has to be puri­
fied, and that dormant, natural love for Kr�J).a has to be revived. That is 
the whole process. 
To practice the regulative principles of bhakti-yoga one should, under 
the guidance of an expert spiritual master, follow certain principles: one 
should rise early in the morning, take bath, enter the temple and offer 
prayers and chant Hare Kr�J).a, then collect flowers to offer to the Deity, 
cook foodstuffs to offer to the Deity, take prasiidam, and so on. There 
are various rules and regulations which one should follow. And one should 
constantly hear Bhagavad-gitii and Srimad-Bhagavatam from pure devotees. 
This practice can help anyone to rise to the level of love of God, and then 
he is sure of his progress into the spiritual kingdom of God. This practice 
of bhakti-yoga, under the rules and regulations, with the direction of a 
spiritual master, will surely bring one to the stage of love of God.

TRANSLATION 
If you cannot practice the regulations of bhakti-yoga, then just try to 
work for Me, because by working for Me you will come to the perfect 
stage. 
PURPORT 
One who is not able even to practice the regulative principles of bhakti­
yoga, under the guidance of a spiritual master, can still be drawn to this 
perfectional stage by working for the Supreme Lord. How to do this work 
has already been explained in the fifty-fifth verse of the Eleventh Chapter. 
One should be sympathetic to the propagation of Kr�l).a consciousness. 
There are many devotees who are engaged in the propagation of Kr�l).a 
consciousness, and they require help. So, even if one cannot directly 
practice the regulated principles of bhakti-yoga, he can try to help such 
work. Every endeavor requires land, capital, organization, and labor. Just 
as, in business, one requires a place to stay, some capital to use, some labor, 
and some organization to expand, so the same is required in the service of 
Kr�l].a. The only difference is that in materialism one works for sense 
gratification. The same work, however, can be performed for the satisfac­
tion of Kr�l).a, and that is spiritual activity. If one has sufficient money, he 
can help in building an office or temple for propagating Kr�l).a conscious­
ness. Or he can help with publications. There are various fields of activity, 
and one should be interested in such activities. If one cannot sacrifice the 
result of such activities, the same person can still sacrifice some percentage 
to propagate Kr�l}.a consciousness. This voluntary service to the cause of 
Kr�l}.a consciousness will help one to rise to a higher state of love for God, 
whereupon one becomes perfect.

TRANSLATION 
If, however, you are unable to work in this consciousness, then try to 
act giving up all results of your work and try to be self-situated. 
PURPORT 
It may be that one is unable to even sympathize with the activities of 
Kr�l)a consciousness because of social, familial or religious considerations 
or because of some other impediments. If one attaches himself directly to 
the activities of Kr�l)a consciousness, there may be objection from family 
members, or so many other difficulties. For one who has such a problem, 
it is advised that he sacrifice the accumulated result of his activities to 
some good cause. Such procedures are described in the Vedic rules. 
There are many descriptions of sacrifices and special functions of the 
pumundi, or special work in which the result of one's previous action may 
be applied. Thus one may gradually become elevated to the state of 
knowledge. It is also found that when one ,who is not even interested in 
the activities of Kr�l)a consciousness gives charity to some hospital or 
some other social institution, he gives up the hard-earned results of his 
activities. That is also recommended here because by the practice of 
giving up the fruits of one's activities one is sure to purify his mind gradu­
ally, and in that purified stage of mind one becomes able to understand 
Kr�l)a consciousness. Of course Kn;l)a consciousness is not dependent on 
any other experience because Kr�l)a consciousness itself can purify one's 
mind, but if there are impediments to Kr�l)a consciousness, one may try 
to give up the result of his action. In that respect, social service, community 
service, national service, sacrifice for one's country, etc., may be accepted 
so that some day one may come to the stage of pure devotional service to 
the Supreme Lord. In Bhagavad-gitii we find it is stated: yata� pravrttir

TRANSLATION 
If you cannot take to this practice, then engage yourself in the cultiva­
tion of knowledge. Better than knowledge, however, is meditation, and 
better than meditation is renunciation of the fruits of action, for by such 
renunciation one can attain peace of mind. 
PURPORT 
As mentioned in the previous verses, there are two kinds of devotional 
service: the way of regulated principles, and the way of full attachment in 
love to the Supreme Personality of Godhead. For those who are actually 
not able to follow the principles of Kr�IJ.a consciousness, it is better to 
cultivate knowledge because by knowledge one can be able to understand 
his real position. Gradually knowledge will develop to the point of 
· meditation. By meditation one can be able to understand the Supreme 
Personality of Godhead by a gradual process. There are processes which 
make one understand that one himself is the Supreme, and that sort of 
meditation is preferred if one is unable to engage in devotional service. If 
610 
Bhagavad-glta As It Is 
[Ch. 12 
one is not able to meditate in such a way, then there are prescribed duties, 
as enjoined in the Vedic literature, for the b riihmartas, vaiSyas, and siidras, 
which we shall find in a later chapter of Bhagavad-gitii. But in all cases, one 
should give up the result or fruits of labor; this means to employ the result 
of karma for some good cause. In summary, to reach the Supreme 
Personality of Godhead, the highest goal, there are two processes: one 
process is by gradual development, and the other process is direct. 
Devotional service in Kr�l).a consciousness is the direct method, and the 
other method involves renouncing the fruits of one's activities. Then one 
can come to the stage of knowledge, then to the stage of meditation, then 
to the stage of understanding the Supersoul, and then to the stage of the 
Supreme Personality of Godhead. One may either take the step by step 
process or the direct path. The direct process is not possible for everyone; 
therefore the indirect process is also good. It is, however, to be understood 
that the indirect process is not recommended for Arjuna because he is 
already at the stage of loving devotional service to·the Supreme Lord. It is 
for others who are not at this state; for them the gradual process of 
renunciation, knowledge, meditation and realization of the Supersoul and 
Brahman should be followed. But as far as Bhagavad-gitii is concerned, it 
is the direct method that is stressed. Everyone is advised to take to the 
direct method and surrender unto the Supreme Personality of Godhead, 
Kr�l).a.

TRANSLATION 
One who is not envious but who is a kind friend to all living entities, who 
does not think himself a proprietor, who is free from false ego and equal 
both in happiness and distress, who is always satisfied and engaged in 
devotional service with determination and whose mind and intelligence 
are in agreement with Me-he is very dear to Me. 
PURPORT 
Coming again to the point of pure devotional service, the Lord is 
describing the transcendental qualifications of a pure devotee in these two 
verses. A pure devotee is never disturbed in any circumstances. Nor is he 
envious of anyone. Nor does a devotee become his enemy's enemy; he 
thinks that one is acting as his enemy due to his own past misdeeds. Thus 
it is better to suffer than to protest. In the Srimad-Bhiigavatam it is stated: 
tat te 'nukampiirh su-samik�yamarzo. Whenever a devotee is in distress 
or has fallen into difficulty, he thinks that it is the Lord's mercy 
upon him. He thinks: "Thanks to my past misdeeds I should suffer 
far, far greater than I am suffering now. So it is by the mercy of the 
Supreme Lord that I am not getting all the punishment I am due. I am just 
getting a little, by the mercy of the Supreme Personality of Godhead." 
Therefore he is always calm, quiet and patient, despite many distressful 
conditions. A devotee is also always kind to everyone, even to his enemy. 
Nirmama means that a devotee does not attach much importance to the 
peace and trouble pertaining to the body because he knows perfectly well 
that he is not the material body. He does not identify with the body; 
therefore he is freed from the conception of false ego and is equiposed 
both in happiness and distress. He is tolerant, and he is satisfied with what­
ever comes by the grace of the Supreme Lord. He does not endeavor much 
to achieve something with great difficulty; therefore he is always joyful. 
He is a completely perfect mystic because he is fixed in the instructions 
� i 
I 
i 
612 
Bhagavad-gita As It Is 
[0.. 12 
received from the spiritual master, and because his senses are controlled, 
he is determined. He is not swayed by false argument because no one can 
lead him from the fixed determination of devotional service. He is fully 
conscious that Kp�qa is the eternal Lord, so no one can disturb him. All his 
qualifications enable him to depend entirely on the Supreme Lord. Such a 
standard of devotional service is undoubtably very rare, but a devotee 
becomes situated in that stage by following the regulative principles of 
devotional service. Furthermore, the Lord says that such a devotee is very 
dear to Him, for the Lord is always pleased with all his activities in full 
Kr�IJ.a consciousness.

TRANSLATION 
He for whom no one is put into difficulty and who is not disturbed by 
anxiety, who is steady in happiness and distress, is very dear to Me. 
PURPORT 
A few of a devotee's qualifications are further being described. No one 
is put into difficulty, anxiety, fearfulness, or dissatisfaction by such a 
devotee. Since a devotee is kind to everyone, he does not act in such a way 
to put others into anxiety. At the same time, if others try to put a devotee 
into anxiety, he is not disturbed. It is by the grace of the Lord that he is 
i 
Text 16 J 
Devotional Service 
613 
so practiced that he is not disturbed by any outward disturbance. Actually 
because a devotee is always engrossed in Kr�Q.a consciousness and engaged 
in devotional service, all such material circumstances cannot woo him. 
Generally a materialistic person becomes very happy when there is some­
thing for his sense gratification and his body, but when he sees that others 
have something for their sense gratification and he hasn't, he is sorry and 
envious. When he is expecting some retaliation from an enemy, he is in a 
state of fear, and when he cannot successfully execute something he be­
comes dejected. But a devotee is always transcendental to all these distur­
bances; therefore he is very dear to Kr�Q.a.

A devotee who is not dependent on the ordinary course of activities, 
who is pure, expert, without cares, free from all pains, and who does not

PURPORT 
Money may be offered to a devotee, but he should not struggle to 
acquire it. If automatically, by the grace of the Supreme, money comes to 
him, he is not agitated. Naturally a devotee takes bath at least twice in a 
day and rises early in the morning for devotional service. Thus he is 
naturally clean both inwardly and outwardly. A devotee is always expert

' j 
I 
J 
614 
Bhagavad-gita As It Is 
[Ch. 12 
because he fully knows the sense of all activities of life, and he is convinced 
of the authoritative scriptures. A devotee never takes the part of a parti­
cular party; therefore he is carefree. He is never pained because he is free 
from all designations; he knows that his body is a designation, so if there 
are some bodily pains, he is free. The pure devotee dDes not endeavor for 
anything which is against the principles of devotional service. For example, 
constructing a big building requires great energy, and a devotee does not 
take to such business if it does not benefit him by advancing his devotional 
service. He may construct a temple for the Lord, and for that he may take 
all kinds of anxiety, but he does not construct a big house for his personal 
relations.

he does not lament. Similarly, if he does not get what he desires, he is not

auspicious and sinful activities. He is prepared to accept all kinds of risks 
for the satisfaction of the Supreme Lord. Nothing is an impediment in the 
discharge of his devotional service. Such a devotee is very dear to Kr�JJ.a.

616 
Bhagavad-g'ita As It 1s 
[Ch. 12 . 
PURPORT 
A devotee is always free from all bad association. Sometimes one is 
praised and sometimes one is defamed; that is the nature of human society. 
But a devotee is always transcendental t<J artificial fame and infamy, 
distress or happiness. He is very patient. He does not speak of anything 
but the topics about Kr�J)a; therefore he is called silent. Silent does not 
mean that one should not speak; silent means that one should not speak 
nonsense. One should speak only of essentials, and the most essential 
speech for the devotee is to speak of the Supreme Lord. He is happy in all 
conditions; sometimes he may get very palatable foodstuffs, sometimes 
not, but he is satisfied. Nor does he care for any residential facility. He 
may sometimes live underneath a tree, and he may sometimes live in a 
very palatial building; he is attracted to neither. He is called fixed because 
he is fixed in his determination and knowledge. We may find some repe­
tition in the descriptions of the qualifications of a devotee, but this is 
just to give an illustration of the fact that a devotee must acquire all these 
qualifications. Without good qualifications, one cannot be a pure devotee. 
One who is not a devotee has no good qualification. One who wants to be 
recognized as a devotee should develop the good qualifications. Of course 
he does not extraneously endeavor to acquire these qualifications, but 
engagement in Kr�J)a consciousness and devotional service automatically 
helps him develop them.

Devotional Service 
617 
TRANSLATION 
He who follows this imperishable path of devotional service and who 
completely engages himself with faith, making Me the supreme goal, is 
very, very dear to Me. 
PURPORT 
In this chapter the religion of eternal engagement, the explanation ofthe 
process of transcendental service for approaching the Supreme Lord, is 
given. This process is very dear to the Lord, and He accepts a person who 
is engaged in such a process. The question who is better-one who is en­
gaged in the path of impersonal Brahman or one who is engaged in the 
personal service of the Supreme Personality of Godhead-was raised by 
Arjuna, and the Lord replied to him so explicitly that there is no doubt 
that devotional service to the Personality of Godhead is the best of all 
processes of spiritual realization. In other words, in this chapter it is de­
cided that through good association, one develops attachment for pure 
devotional service and thereby accepts a bona fide spiritual master and 
from him begins to hear and chant and observe the regulative principles of 
devotional service with faith, attachment and devotion and thus becomes 
engaged in the transcendental service of the Lord. This path is recom­
mended in this chapter; therefore there is no doubt that devotional 
service is the only absolute path for self-realization, for the attainment of 
the Supreme Personality of Godhead. The impersonal conception of the 
Supreme Absolute Truth, as described in this chapter, is recommended 
only up to the time one surrenders himself for self-realization. In other 
words, as long as one does not have the chance to associate with a pure 
devotee, the impersonal conception may be beneficial. In the impersonal 
conception of the Absolute Truth one works without fruitive result, 
meditates and cultivates knowledge to understand spirit and matter. This 
is necessary as long as one is not in the association of a pure devotee. 
Fortunately, if one develops directly a desire to engage in Kr�Qa con­
sciousness in pure devotional service, he does not need to undergo step by 
step improvements in spiritual realization. Devotional service, as described 
in the middle six chapters of Bhagavad-gitii, is more congenial. One need 
not bother about materials to keep body and soul together because by the 
grace of the Lord everything is carried out automatically. 
Thus end the Bhaktivedanta Purports to the Twelfth Chapter of the 
Srimad-Bhagavad-gita in the matter of Devotional Service.

TRANSLATION 
Arjuna said: 0 my dear Kr�l).a, I wish to know about prakrti [nature], 
Puru�a [the enjoyer J, and the field and the knower of the field, and of 
knowledge and the end of knowledge. The Blessed Lord then said: This 
body, 0 son of Kunti, is called the field, and one who knows this body is 
called the knower of the field. 
PURPORT 
Arjuna was inquisitive about prakrti, or nature, puru§a, the enjoyer, 
k§etra, the field, k§etrajii.a, its knower, and ofknowledge and the object 
of knowledge. When he inquired about all these, Kr�l).a said that this body 
is called the field and that one who knows this body is called the knower 
of the field. This body is the field of activity for the conditioned soul. The 
conditioned soul is entrapped in material existence, and he attempts to 
lord over material nature. And so, according to his capacity to dominate 
material nature, he gets a field of activity. That field of activity is the 
body. And what is the body? The body is made of senses. The conditioned 
soul wants to enjoy sense gratification, and, according to his capacity to 
enjoy sense gratification, he is offered a body, or field of activity. There­
fore the body is called k§etra, or the field of activity for the conditioned 
soul. Now, the person who identifies himself with the body is called 
k§etrajii.a, the knower of the field. It is not very difficult to understand 
the difference between the field and its knower, the body and the knower 
of the body. Any person can consider that from childhood to old age he 
' 
.:.-
" 
Text 3] 
Nature, the Enjoyer, and Consciousness 
621 
undergoes so many changes of body and yet is still one person, remaining. 
Thus there is a difference between the knower of the field of activities and 
the actual field of activities. A living conditioned soul can thus understand 
that he is different from the body. It is described in the beginning-dehe 
'smin-that the living entity is within the body and that the body is 
changing from childhood to boyhood and from boyhood to youth and 
from youth to old age, and the person who owns the body knows that 
the body is changing. The owner is distinctly k§etrajna. Sometimes we 
understand that I am happy, I am mad, I am a woman, I am a dog, I am a 
cat: these are the knowers. The knower is different from the field. Al­
though we use many articles-our clothes, etc.-we know that we are 
different from the things used. Similarly, we also understand by a little 
contemplation that we are different from the body. 
In the first six chapters of Bhagavad-gitii, the knower of the body, the 
living entity, and the position by which he can understand the Supreme 
Lord are described. In the middle six chapters of the Gitii, the Supreme 
Personality of Godhead and the relationship between the individual soul 
and the Supersoul in regard to devotional service are described. The 
superior position of the Supreme Personality of Godhead and the subor­
dinate position of the individual soul are definitely defined in these chap­
ters. The living entities are subordinate under all circumstances, but in their 
forgetfulness they are suffering. When enlightened by pious activities, they 
approach the Supreme Lord in different capacities-as the distressed, those 
in want of money, the inquisitive, and those in search of knowledge. That 
is also described. Now, starting with the Thirteenth Chapter, how the living 
entity comes into contact with material nature, how he is delivered by the 
Supreme Lord through the different methods of fruitive activities, cultiva­
tion of knowledge, and the discharge of devotional service are explained. 
Although the living entity is completely different from the material body, 
he somehow becomes related. This also is explained.

TRANSLATION 
0 scion of Bharata, you should understand that I am also the knower in 
all bodies, and to understand this body and its owner is called knowledge. 
That is My opinion. 
PURPORT 
While discussing the subject of this body and the owner of the body, the 
soul and the Supersoul, we shall find three different topics of study: the 
Lord, the living entity, and matter. In every field of activities, in every 
body, there are two souls: the individual soul and the Supersoul. Because 
the Supersoul is the plenary expansion of the Supreme Personality of God­
head, Kr��Ja, Kr��Ja says, "I am also the knower, but I am not the individual 
owner of the body. I am the superknower. I am present in every body as 
the Paramatma, or Supersoul." 
One who studies the subject matter of the field of activity and the 
knower of the field very minutely, in terms of this Bhagavad-gita, ca� 
attain to knowledge. 
" 
The Lord says: "I am the knower of the field of activities in every 
individual body." The individual may be the knower of his own body, but 
he is not in knowledge of other bodies. The Supreme Personality of God­
head, who is present as the Supersoul in all bodies, knows everything 
about all bodies. He knows all the different bodies of all the various species 
of life. A citizen may know everything about his patch of land, but the 
king knows not only his palace but all the properties possessed by the 
individual citizens. Similarly, one may be the proprietor of the body 
individually, but th� Supreme Lord is the proprietor of all bodies. The 
king is the original proprietor of the kingdom, and the citizen is the 
secondary proprietor. Similarly, the Supreme Lord is the supreme pro­
prietor of all bodies. 
The body consists of the senses. The Supreme Lord is Hr�ikesa, which 
means controller of the senses. He is the original controller of the senses, 
just as the king is the original controll�r of all the activities of the state, 
Text 3) 
Nature, the Enjoyer, and Consciousness 
623 
and the citizens are secondary controllers. The Lord also says: "I am also 
the knower." This means that He is the superknower; the individual soul 
knows only his particular body. In the Vedic literature, it is stated as 
follows: 
k§etriipi hi §aririipi bijarit ciipi §ubhiisubhe 
tiini vetti sa yogiitmii tata[l k§etrajiia ucyate. 
This body is called the k§etra, and within it dwells the owner of the body 
and the Supreme Lord who knows both the body and the owner of the 
body. Therefore He is called the knower of all fields. The distinction 
between the field of activities, the owner of activities and the supreme 
owner of activities is described as follows. Perfect knowledge of the consti· 
tution of the body, the constitution of the individual soul, and the consti­
tution of the Supersoul is known in terms of Vedic literature as jiiiinam. 
That is the opinion of Kr�l)a. To understand both the soul and the Super­
soul as one yet distinct is knowledge. One who does not understand the 
field of activity and the knower of activity is not in perfect knowledge. 
One has to understand the position of prakrti, nature, and puru§a, the 
enjoyer of the nature, and isvara, the knower who dominates or controls 
nature and the individual soul. One should not confuse the three in their 
different capacities. One should not confuse the painter, the painting 
and the easel. This material world, which is the field of activities, is nature, 
and the enjoyer of nature is the living entity, and above them both is the 
supreme controller, the Personality of Godhead. It is stated in the Vedic 
language: 
"bhoktii bhogyarit preritiirarit ca matvii sarvarit proktarit tri­
vidharit brahmam etat." There are three Brahman conceptions: prakrti is 
Brahman as the field of activities, and the jiva (individual soul) is also 
Brahman and is trying to control material nature, and the controller of 
both of them is also Brahman, but He is the factual controller. 
In this chapter it will be also explained that out of the two knowers, 
one is fallible and the other is infallible. One is superior and the other is 
subordinate. One who understands the two knowers of the field to be one 
and the same contradicts the Supreme Personality of Godhead who states 
here very clearly that "I am also the knower of the field of activity." One 
who misunderstands a rope to be a serpent is not in knowledge. There are 
different kinds of bodies, and there are different owners of the bodies. 
Because each individual soul has his individual capacity of lording it over 
material nature, there are different bodies. But the Supreme also is present 
in them as the controller. The word ca is significant, for it indicates the 
' 
,-
624

[Ch. 13 . 
total number of bodies. Thatis the opinion of Srila Baladeva Vidyabhu�al).a: 
Kr�l).a is the Supersoul present in each and every body apart from the 
individual soul. And Kr�l).a explicitly says here that the Supersoul is the 
controller of both the field of activities and the finite enjoyer.

Now please hear My brief description of this field of activity and how

PURPORT 
The Lord is describing the field of activities and the knower of the field 
of activities in their constitutional positions. One has to know how this 
body is constituted, the materials of which this body is made, under whose 
control this body is working, how the changes are taking place, wherefrom 
the changes are coming, what the causes are, what the reasons are, what 
the ultimate goal of the individual is. ·and what the actual form of the 
individual soul is. One should also know the distinction between the 
individual living soul and the Supersoul, the different influences, their 
potentials, etc. One just has to understand this Bhagavad-gita directly from 
the description given by the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and all this 
J '

will be clarified. But one should be careful not to consider the Supreme 
Personality of Godhead in every body and individual soul to be the jiva. 
This is something like equalizing the potent and the impotent.

TRANSLATION 
That knowledge of the field of activities and of the knower of activities 
is described by various sages in various Vedic writings-especially in the 
V edanta-siitra-and is presented with all reasoning as to cause and effect. 
PURPORT 
The Supreme Personality of Godhead, Kr�J).a, is the highest authority in 
explaining this knowledge. Still, as a matter of course, learned scholars and· 
standard authorities always give evidence from previous authorities. Kr�J).a 
is explaining this most controversial point regarding the duality and non­
duality of the soul and the Supersoul by referring to Scriptures, the Vedanta, 
which are accepted as authority. First, He says, this is according to differ­
ent sages. As far as the sages are concerned, besides Himself, Vyasadeva, 
the author of the Vediinta-siitra, is a great sage, and in the Vediinta-siitra 
duality is perfectly explained. And Vyasadeva's father, Parasara, was also a 
great sage, and he writes in his books of religiosity: "aham tvarh ca 
athiinye ... ""We-you, I and various other living entitie�-are all transcen­
dental, although in material bodies. Now we are fallen into the ways of the 
..·11

[Ch .. 13 
three modes of material nature according to our different karma. As such, 
some are on higher levels, and some are in the lower nature. The higher 
and lower natures exist due to ignorance and are being manifested in an 
infinite number of living entities. But the Supersoul, which is infallible, is 
uncontaminated by the three qualities of nature and is tran�cendentaL" 
Similarly, in the original Vedas, a distinction between the soul, the Super­
soul and the body is made, especially in the Katha Upani§ad. 
There is a manifestation of the Supreme Lord's energy known as 
annamaya by which one depends simply upon food for existence. This is a 
materialistic realization of the Supreme. Then there is priiramaya; this 
means that after realizing the Supreme Absolute Truth in foodstuff, one 
can realize the Absolute Truth in the living symptoms, or life forms. In 
jniinamaya the living symptom develops to the point of thinking, feeling, 
and willing. Then there is Brahman realization and the realization called 
vijniinamaya by which the living entity's mind and life symptoms are 
distinguished from the living entity himself. The next and supreme stage is 
iinandamaya, realization of the all-blissful nature. Thus there are five stages 
of Brahman realization, which is called brahma puccham. Out of these 
the first three-annamaya, priiramaya, and jniinamaya-involve the fields 
of activities of the living entities. Transcendental to all these fields of 
activities is the Supreme Lord, who is called iinandamaya. In the Vediinta­
siitra also the Supreme is called iinandamayo 
'bhyiisiit. The Supreme 
Personality of Godhead is by nature full of joy, and to enjoy His transcen­
dental bliss, He expands into vijniinamaya, priiramaya, jniinamaya, and 
annamaya. In this field of activities the living entity is considered to be the 
enjoyer, and different from him is the iinandamaya. That means that if the 
living entity decides to enjoy, in dovetailing himself with the iinandamaya, 
then he becomes perfect. This is the real picture of the Supreme Lord, as 
supreme knower of the field, the living entity, as subordinate knower, and 
the nature of the field of activities.

The five great elements, false ego, intelligence, the unmanifested, the 
ten senses, the mind, the five sense objects, desire, hatred, happiness, 
distress, the aggregate, the life symptoms, and convictions-all these are 
considered, in summary, to be the field of activities and its interactions. 
PURPORT 
From all the authoritative statements of the great sages, the Vedic 
hymns and the aphorisms of the Vediinta-siitra, the components of this 
world are earth, water, fire, air and ether. These are the five great elements 
(mahiibhiita). Then there are false ego, intelligence and the unmanifested 
stage of the three modes of nature. Then there are five senses for acquiring 
knowledge: the eyes, ears, nose, tongue and touch. Then five working 
senses: voice, legs, hands, the anus and the genitals. Then, above the senses, 
there is the mind, which is within and which can be called the sense within. 
Therefore, including the mind, there are eleven senses altogether. Then 
there are the five objects of the senses: smell, taste, warmth, touch and 
sound. Now the aggregate of these twenty-four elements is called the field 
of activity. If one makes an analytical study of these twenty-four subjects, 
then he can very well understand the field of activity. Then there is desire, 
!, 
628 
Bhagavad-gita As It Is 
[Ch. 13 
hatred, pleasure and pain, which are interactions, representations of the 
five great elements in the gross body. The living symptoms, represented by 
consciousness and conviction, are the manifestation of the subtle body­
mind, ego and intelligence. These subtle elements are included within the 
field of activities. 
The five great elements are a gross representation of the subtle false ego. 
They are a representation in the material conception. Consciousness is 
represented by intelligence, of which the unmanifested stage is the three 
modes of material nature. The unmanifested three modes of material 
nature is called pradhiina. 
. 
One who desires to know the twenty-four elements in detail along 
with their interactions should study the philosophy in more detail. In 
Bhagavad-gitii, a summary only is given. 
The body is the representation of all these factors, and there are changes 
of the body, which are six in number: the body is born, it grows, it stays, 
it produces by-products, then begins to decay, and at the last stage it 
vanishes. Therefore the field is a nonpermanent material thing. However, 
the k§etrajiia, the knower of the field, its proprietor, is different.

to children, wife, home and the rest, and evenmindedness amid pleasant 
and unpleasant events; constant and unalloyed devotion to Me, resort­
ing to solitary places, detachment from the general mass of people; 
accepting the importance of self-realization, and philosophi(1.al search for 
the Absolute Truth-all these I thus declare to be knowledge, and what is 
contrary to these is ignorance. 
PURPORT 
This process of knowledge is sometimes misunderstood by less intelligent 
men as being the interaction of the field of activity. But actually this is the 
real process of knowledge. If one accepts this process, then the possibility 
of approaching the Absolute Truth exists. This is not the interaction of 
the tenfold elements, as described before, This is actually the means to get 
out of it. Of all the descriptions of the process of knowledge, the most 
important point is described in the first line of the tenth verse: The process 
of knowledge terminates in unalloyed devotional service to the Lord. So, 
if one does not approach, or is not able to approach, the transcendental 
service of the Lord, then the other nineteen items are of no particular 
value. But, if one takes to devotional service in full Kr�Q.a consciousness, 
the other nineteen items automatically develop within him. The principle 
of. accepting a spiritual master, as mentioned in the seventh verse, is essen­
tial. Even for one who takes to devotional service, it is most important. 
Transcendental life begins when one accepts a bona fide spiritual master. 
The Supreme Personality of Godhead, Sri Kr�Q.a, clearly states here that 
this process of knowledge is the actual path. Anything speculated beyond 
this is nonsense. 
As for the knowledge outlined here, the items may be analyzed as fol­
lows: Humility means that one should not be anxious to have the satisfac­
tion of being honored by others. The material conception of life makes us 
very eager to receive honor from others, but from the point of view of a 
man in perfect knowledge-who knows that he is not this body-anything, 
honor or dishonor, pertaining to this body is useless. One should not be 
hankering after this material deception. People are very anxious to be 
famous for their religion, and consequently sometimes it is found that 
without understanding the principles of religion, one enters into some 
group, which is not actually following religious principles, and then wants 
to advertise himself as a religious mentor. As for actual advancement in 
Texts 8-12] 
Nature, the Enjoyer, and Consciousness 
63l 
spiritual science, one shou[d have a test to see how far he is progressing. 
He can judge by these items. 
Nonviolence is generally taken to mean not killing or destroying the 
body, but actually nonviolence means not to put others into distress. 
People in general are trapped by ignorance in the material concept of life, 
and they perpetually suffer material pains. So, unless one elevates people 
to spiritual knowledge, one is practicing violence. One should try his best 
to distribute real knowledge to the people, so that they may become en­
lightened and leave this material entanglement. That is nonviolence. 
Tolerance means that one should be practiced to bear insult and dishonor 
from others. If one is engaged in the advancement of spiritual knowledge, 
there will be so many insults and much dishonor from others. This is 
expected because material nature is so constituted. Even a boy like 
Prahlada, who, only five years old, was engaged in the cultivation of spiri­
tual knowledge, was endangered when his father became antagonistic to 
his devotion. The father tried to kill him in so many ways, but Prahlada 
tolerated him. So, for making advancement in spiritual knowledge, there 
may be many impediments; but we should be tolerant and continue our 
progress with determination. 
Simplicity means that without diplomacy one should be so straight­
forward that he can disclose the real truth even to an enemy. As for accep­
tance of the spiritual master, that is essential, because without the instruc­
tion of a bona fide spiritual master, one cannot progress in the spiritual 
science. One should approach the spiritual master with all humility and 
offer him all services so that he will be pleased to bestow his blessings 
upon the disciple. Because a bona fide spiritual master is a representative 
of Kr�va, if he bestows any blessings upon his disciple, that will make the 
disciple immediately advanced without the disciple's following the regulated 
principles. Or, the regulated principles will be easier for one who has 
served the spiritual master without reservation. 
Cleanliness is essential for making advancement in spiritual life. There 
are two kinds of cleanliness: external and internal. External cleanliness 
means taking a bath, but for internal cleanliness, one has to think of Kr�J)a 
always and chant Hare Kr�J)a, Hare Kr�l).a, Kr�J)a Kr�J)a, Hare Hare/Hare 
Ram a,. Hare Ram a, Ram a Ram a, Hare Hare. This process cleans the 'accu­
mulated dust of past karma from the mind. 
Steadiness means that one should be very determined to make progress 
in spiritual life. Without such determination, one cannot make tangible 
progress. And self-control means that one should not accept anything 
which is detrimental to the path of spiritual progress. One should become 
accustomed to this and reject anything which is against the path of spiritual

[Ch. 13 
progress. This is real renunciation. The senses are so strong that they are 
always anxious to have sense gratification. One should not cater to these 
demands, which are not necessary. The senses should only be gratified to 
keep the body fit so that one can discharge his duty in advancing in spiri-
. tual life. The most important and uncontrollable sense is the tongue. If 
one can control the tongue, then there is every possibility of controlling 
the other senses. The function of the tongue is to taste and to vibrate. 
Therefore, by systematic regulation, the tongue should always be engaged 
in tasting the remnants of foodstuffs offered to Krg1a and chanting Hare 
Kn>Q.a. As far as the eyes are concerned, they should not be allowed to see 
anything but the beautiful form of Kn>Q.a. That will control the eyes. 
Similarly, the ears should be engaged in hearing about Kr�Q.a and the nose 
in smelling the flowers offered to Kr�Q.a. This is the process of devotional 
service, and it is understood here that Bhagavad-gitii is simply expounding 
the science of devotional service. Devotional service is the main and sole 
objective. Unintelligent commentators on the Gitii try to divert the mind 
of the reader to other subjects, but there is no other subject in Bhagavad­
gitii but devotional service. 
False ego means accepting this body as oneself. When one understands 
that he is not his body and is spirit soul, that is real ego. Ego is there. False 
ego is condemned, but not real ego. In the Vedic literature, it is said: 
aham brahmiismi. I am Brahman, I am spirit. This "I am," the sense of self, 
also exists in the liberated stage of self-realization. This sense of "I am" is 
ego, but when the sense of "I am" is applied to this false body, it is false 
ego. When the sense of self is applied to reality, that is real ego. There are 
some philosophers who say we should give up our ego, but we cannot give 
up our ego because ego means identity. We ought, of course, to give up the 
false identification with the body. 
One should try to understand the distress of accepting birth, death, old 
age and disease. There are descriptions in various Vedic literatures of birth. 
In the Srimad-Bhiigavatam the world of the unborn, the child's stay in the 
womb of the mother, its suffering, etc., are all very graphically described. 
It should be thoroughly understood that birth is distressful. Because we 
forget how mt�ch distress we have suffered within the womb of the mother, 
we do not make any solution to the repetition of birth and death. Similar.­
ly at the time of death, there are all kinds of sufferings, and they are also 
mentioned in the authoritative scriptures. These should be discussed. And 
as far as disease and old age are concerned, everyone gets practical experi­
ence. No one wants to be diseased, and no one wants to become old, but 
there is no avoiding these. Unless we have a pessimistic view of this mate-
Texts 8-12] 
Nature, the Enjoyer, and Consciousness 
633 
rial life, considering the distresses of birth, death, old age and disease, there 
is no impetus for our making advancement in spiritual life. 
As for detachment from children, wife and home, it is not meant that 
one should have no feeling for these. They are natural objects of affection, 
but when they are not favorable to spiritual progress, then one should not 
be attached to them. The best process for making the home pleasant is 
Kr�Q.a consciousness. If one is in full Kr�Q.a consciousness, he can make his 
home very happy because this process of Kr�Q.a consciousness -is very easy. 
One need only chant Hare Kr�Q.a, Hare Kr�Q.a, Kr�Q.a Kr�Q.a, Hare Hare/Hare 
Rama, Hare Rama, Rama Rama, Hare Hare, accept the remnants of food­
stuffs offered to Kr�Q.a, have some discussion on books like Bhagavad-gitii 
and Srimad-Bhiigavatam, and engage oneself in Deity worship. These four 
will make one happy. One should train the members of his family in this 
way. The family members can sit down morning and evening and chant 
together Hare Kr�Q.a, Hare Kr�Q.a, Kr�Q.a Kr�Q.a, Hare Hare/Hare Rama, 
Hare Rama, Rama Rama, Hare Hare. If one can mold his family life in this 
way to develop Kr�Q.a consciousness, following these four principles, then 
there is no need to change from family life to renounced life. But if it is 
not congenial, not favorable for spiritual advancement, then family life 
should be abandoned. One must sacrifice everything to realize or serve 
Kr�Q.a, just as Arjuna did. Arjuna did not want to kill his family members, 
but when he understood that these family members were impediments to 
his Kr�Q.a realization, he accepted the instruction of Kr�Q.a and fought and 
killed them. In all cases, one should be detached from the happiness and 
distress of family life because in this world one can never be fully happy 
or fully miserable. Happiness and distress are concommitant factors of 
material life. One should learn to tolerate, as advised in Bhagavad-gitii. 
One can never restrict the coming and going of happiness and distress, so 
one should be detached from the materialistic way of life and be automati­
cally equiposed in both cases. Generally, when we get something desirable, 
we are very happy, and when we get something undesirable, we are dis­
tressed. But if we are actually in the spiritual position, these things will not 
agitate us. To reach that stage, we have to practice unbreakable devotional 
service; devotional service to Kr�Q.a without deviation means engaging one­
self in the nine processes of devotional service, chanting, hearing, worship­
ing, offering respect, etc., as described in the last verse of the Ninth Chap­
ter. That process should be followed. Naturally, when one is adapted to 
the spiritual way of life, he will not want to mix with materialistic men. 
That would go against his grain. One may test himself by seeing how far 
he is inclined to live in a solitary place without unwanted association.

Bhagavad-gita As It Is 
[Ch. 13 
Naturally a devotee has no taste for unnecessary sporting or cinema-going 
or enjoying some social function, because he understands that these are 
simply a waste of time. There are many research scholars and philosophers 
who study sex life or some other subject, but according to Bhagavad-gitii, 
such research work and philosophical speculation have no value. That is 
more or less nonsensical. According to Bhagavad-gitii, one should make 
research by philosophical discretion into the nature of the soul. One 
should make research to understand with what the self is concerned. That 
is recommended here. 
As far as self-realization is concerned, it is clearly stated here that 
bhakti-yoga is especially practical. As soon as there is a question of devo­
tion, one must consider the relationship between the Supersoul and the 
individual soul. The individual soul and the Supersoul cannot be one, at 
least not in the bhakti conception, the devotional conception of life. 
This service of the individual soul to the Supreme Soul is eternal, nityam, 
as is clearly stated. So bhakti or devotional service is eternal. One should be 
established in that philosophical conviction, otherwise it is only a waste of 
time, ignorance. 
In the Srimad-Bhiigavatam, this is explained; vadanti tat tattva-vidas 
tattvam yaj jniinam advayam. "Those who are actually knowers of the 
Absolute Truth know that the Self is realized in three different phases as 
Brahman, Paramiitmii and Bhagaviin." (Bhiig. 1.2.11) Bhagaviin is the last 
word in the realization of the Absolute Truth; therefore one should reach 
up to that platform of understanding the Supreme Personality of Godhead 
and thus engage in the devotional service of the Lord. That is perfection of 
knowledge. 
Beginning from practicing humility up to the point of realization of the 
Supreme Truth, the Absolute Personality of Godhead, this process is just 
like a staircase beginning from the ground floor up to the top floor. Now 
on this staircase there are so many people who have reached the first floor, 
the second or third floor, etc., but unless one reaches the top floor, which 
is the understanding of Kr�t;J.a, he is at a lower stage of knowledge. If 
anyone wants to compete with God and at the same time make advance­
ment in spiritual knowledge, he will be frustrated. It is clearly stated that 
without humility understanding is harmful. To think oneself God is most 
puffed up. Although the living entity is always being kicked by the 
stringent laws of material nature, still he thinks, "I am God" because of 
ignorance. One should be humble and know that he is subordinate to the 
Supreme Lord. Due to rebellion against the Supreme Lord, one becomes sub­
ordinate to material nature. One must know and be convinced of this truth.

PURPORT 
The Lord has explained the field of activities and the knower of the 
field. He has also explained the process of knowing the knower of the 
field of activities. Now He is explaining the knowable, both the soul and 
the Supersoul respectively. By knowledge of the knower, both the soul 
and the Supersoul, one can relish the nectar of life. As explained in the 
Second Chapter, the living entity is eternal. This is also confirmed here. 
There is no specific date at which the jiva was born. Nor can anyone trace 
out the history of jiviitmii's manifestation from the Supreme Lord. There­
fore it is beginningless. The Vedic literature confirms this: na jiiyate 
mrjayate vii vipascit. The knower of the body is never born and never dies, 
and he is full of knowledge. The Supreme Lord is also stated in the Vedic 
literature as pradhiina-k§etrajiia-patir gur-esa�. The Supreme Lord as the 
Supersoul is the chief knower of the body, and He is the master of the 
three modes of material nature. In the smrti it is said: diisa�bhiito harer 
eva niinyasvaiva kadiicana. The living entities are eternally in the service of

the Supreme Lord. This is also confirmed by Lord Caitanya in His teach-
, ing; therefore the description of Brahman mentioned in this verse is in 
relation to the individual soul, and when the word Brahman is applied to 
the living entity, it is to be understood that he is vijiiiinam brahma as 
opposed to ananta-brahma. Ananta-brahma is the Supreme Brahman Per­
sonality of Godhead.

Everywhere are His hands. and legs, His eyes and faces, and He hears

PURPORT 
As the sun exists diffusing its unlimited rays, so does the Supersoul, or 
Supreme Personality of Godhead. He exists in His all-pervading form, and 
in Him exist all the individual living entities, beginning from the first great 
teacher, Brahm a, down to the small ants. There are unlimited heads, legs, 
hands and eyes, and unlimited living entities. All are existing in and on the 
Supersoul. Therefore the Supersoul is all-pervading. The individual soul, 
however, cannot say that he has his hands, legs and eyes everywhere. That 
is not possible. If he thinks that although under ignorance he is not con­
scious that his hands and legs are diffused all over, but when he attains to

proper knowledge he will come to that stage, his thinking is contradictory. 
This means that the individual soul, having become conditioned by material 
nature, is not supreme. The Supreme is different from the individual soul. 
The Supreme Lord can extend His hand Without limit; the individual soul 
cannot. In Bhagavad-gitii the Lord says that if anyone offers Him a flower, 
or a fruit, or a little water, He accepts. If the Lord is a far distance away, 
how can He accept things? This is the omnipotence of the Lord: even 
though He is situated in His own abode, far, far away from earth, He can 
extend His hand to accept what anyone offers. That is His potency. In the 
Brahma-sarhhitii it is stated, goloka eva nivasati: although He is always 
engaged in pastimes in His transcendental planet, He is all-pervading. The 
individual soul cannot claim that he is all-pervading. Therefore this verse 
describes the Supreme Soul, the Personality of Godhead, not the individual 
soul.

638 
Bhagavad-gita As It Is 
[Ch. 13 . 
PURPORT 
The Supreme Lord, although the source of all the senses of the living 
entities, doesn't have material senses like they have. Actually, the indi­
vidual souls have spiritual senses, but in conditioned life they are covered 
with the material elements, and therefore the sense activities are exhibited 
through matter. The Supreme Lord's senses are not so covered. His senses 
are transcendental and are therefore called nirgur-a. Cur-a means the mate­
rial modes, but His senses are without material covering. It should be under­
stood that His senses are not exactly like ours. Although He is the source 
of all our sensual activities, He has His transcendental senses which are 
uncontaminated. This is very nicely explained in the Svetii.Svatara Upani§ad 
in the verse: saroataf!, piirti·piidam. The Supreme Personality of Godhead 
has no hands which are materially contammated, but He has His hands 
and accepts whatever sacrifice is offered to Him. That is the distinction 
between the conditioned soul and the Supersoul. He has no material eyes, 
but He has eyes-otherwise how could He see? He sees everything, past, 
present and future. He lives within the heart of the living being, and He 
knows what we have done in the past, what we are doing now, and what is 
awaiting us in the future. This is also confirmed in Bhagavad-gitii: He 
knows everything, but no one knows Him. It is said that the Supreme 
Lord has no legs like us, but He can travel throughout space because He has 
spiritual legs. In other words, the Lord is not impersonal; He has His eyes, 
legs, hands and everything else, and because we are part and parcel of the 
Supreme Lord we also have these things. But His hands, legs, eyes and 
senses are not contaminated by material nature. 
Bhagavad-gitii also confirms that when the Lord appears He appears as 
He is by His internal potency. He is not contaminated by the material 
energy because He is the Lord of material energy. In the Vedic literature 
we find that His whole embodiment is spiritual. He has His eternal form 
called sac-cid-iinanda-vigraha. He is full of all opulence. He is the pro­
prietor of all wealth and the owner of all energy. He is the most intelligent 
and is full of knowledge. These are some of the symptoms of the Supreme 
Personality of Godhead. He is maintainer of all living entities and the wit­
ness of all activity. As far as we can understand from Vedic literature, the 
Supreme Lord is always transcendental. Although we do not see His head, 
face, hands, or legs, He has them, and when we are elevated to the transcen­
dental situation then we can see the Lord's form. Due to materially con­
taminated senses, we cannot see His form. Therefore the impersonalists who 
are still materially affected cannot understand the Personality of Godhead.

TRANSLATION 
The Supreme Truth exists both internally and externally, in the moving 
and nonmoving. He is beyond the power of the material senses to see or to 
know. Although far, far away, He is also near to all. 
In Vedic literature we understand that NarayaQ.a, the Supreme Person, 
is residing both outside and inside of every living entity. He is present both 
in the spiritual and material world. Although He is far, far away, still He is 
near to us. These are the. statements of Vedic literature. A sino duram 
vrajati sayiino yiiti sarvata[l. And, because He is always engaged in tran­
scendental bliss, we cannot understand how He is enjoying His full opu­
lence. We cannot see or understand with these material senses. Therefore 
in the Vedic language it is said that to understand Him our material mind 
and senses cannot act. But one who ha:s purified his mind and senses by 
practicing Kr�J}.a consciousness in devotional service can see Him con­
stantly. It is confirmed in Brahma-samhitii that the devotee who has 
developed love for the Supreme God can see Him always, without cessa­
tion. And it is confirmed in Bhagavad-gitii ( 11.54) that He can be seen and 
understood only by devotional service. Bhaktyii tvananyayii sakya[l.

TRANSLATION 
Although the Sitpersoul appears to be divided, He is never divided .. He is 
situated as one. Although He is the maintainer of every living entity, it is 
to be understood that He devours and develops all. 
PURPORT 
The Lord is situated in everyone's heart as the Supersoul. Does that 
mean that He has become divided? No. Actually, He is one. The example 
is given of the sun: the sun, at the meridian, is situated in his place. But if 
one goes for five thousand miles in all directions and asks, "Where is the 
sun?" everyone will say that it is shining on his head. In the Vedic litera­
ture this example is given to show that although He is undivided, He is 
situated as if divided. Also it is said in Vedic literature that one Vigm is 
present everywhere by His omnipotence, just as the sun appears in many 
places to many persons. And the Supreme Lord, although the maintainer 
of every living entity, devours everything at the time of annihilation. This 
was confirmed in the Eleventh Chapter when the Lord said that He has 
come to devour all the warriors assembled at Kuruk�etra. He also mentions 
that in th� form of time He devours also. He is the annihilator, the killer 
of all. When there is creation, He develops all from their original state, and 
at the time of annihilation He devours them. The Vedic hymns confirm 
the fact that He is the origin of all living entities and the rest of all. After 
Text 18]

creation, everything rests in His omnipotence, and after annihilation, every­
thing again returns to rest in Him. These are the confirmations of Vedic 
hymns. Y ato vii imiini bhfitiini jiiyante yena jiitiini jivanti yat prayanty

He is the source of light in all luminous objects. He is beyond the 
darkness of matter and is unmanifested. He is knowledge, He is the object 
of knowledge, and He is the goal of knowledge. He is situated in everyone's 
heart. 
PURPORT 
The Supersoul, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, is the source of 
light in all luminous objects like the sun, moon, stars, etc. In the Vedic 
literature we find that in the spiritual kingdom there is no need of sun or 
moon because the effulgence of the Supreme Lord is there. In the material 
world that brahmajyot� the Lord's spiritual effulgence, is covered by the 
mahat-tattva, the material elements; therefore in this material world we 
require the assistance of sun, moon, electricity, etc., for light. But in the 
spiritual world there is no need of such things. It is clearly stated in the 
Vedic literature that because of His luminous effulgence, everything is 
642 
Bhagavad-gita"As It Is 
[Ch. 13. 
illuminated. It is clear, therefore, that His situation is not in the material 
world. He is situated ;jn the spil;itual world which is far, far away in the 
spiritual sky. That is also confirmed in the Vedic literature. Aditya-va17lam 
tamasal} parastiit. He is just like the sun, eternally luminous, but He is far, 
far beyond the darkness of this material world. His knowledge is transcen­
dental. The Vedic literature confirms that Brahman is concentrated 
transcend�n�al knowledge. To pne who is anxious to be transferred to 
that spiritual world, knowledge is given by the Supreme Lord who is 
situated in everyone's heart. 
One Vedic mantra says : tam ha devam iitma-buddhi-prakiisam mumuk§ur 
vai sara{wm aham prapadye. One must surrender unto the Supreme Per­
sonality of·. Godhead if he at all wants liberation. As far as the goal of 
ultimate knowledge is concerned, it is also confirmed in Vedic literature: 
tam eva viditviitimrtyum eti. "Only by knowing You can one surpass the 
boundary of birth and death." He is situated in everyone's heart as the 
supreme controller. The Supreme has legs and hands distributed every­
where, and this cannot be said of the individual soul. Therefore that there 
are two knowers of the field of activity, the individual soul and the 
Supersoul, must be admitted. One's hands and legs are distributed locally, 
but Kn>Q.a's hands and leg� are distributed everywhere. This is confirmed 
in the Svetiisvatara Upani§ad: sarvasya prabhum isiinam sarvasya sara(lam 
brhat. That Supreme Personality of Godhead, Supersoul, is the prabhu or 
master of all living entities; therefore He is the ultimate center of all living 
entities. So there is no denying the fact that the Supreme Supersoul and 
the individual soul are always different.

TRANSLATION 
Thus the field of activities [the body], knowledge, and the knowable 
have been summarily described by Me. Only My devotees can understand 
this thoroughly and thus attain to My nature. 
PURPORT 
The Lord has described in summary the body, knowledge and the 
knowable. This knowledge is of three things: the knower, the knowable 
and the process of knowing. Combined, these are called vijniinam, or the 
science of knowledge. Perfect knowledge can be understood by the 
unalloyed devotees of the Lord directly. Others are unable to understand. 
The monists say that at the ultimate stage these three items become one, 
but the devotees do not accept this. Knowledge and development of 
knowledge mean understanding oneself in Kr�Q.a consciousness. We are 
being led by material consciousness, but as soon as we transfer all con­
sciousness to Kr�Q.a's activities and realize that Kr�Q.a is everything, then 
we attain real knowledge. In other words, knowledge is nothing but the 
preliminary stage of understanding devotional service perfectly.

[Ch. 13. 
Material nature and the living entities should be understood to be 
beginningless. Their transformations and the modes of matter are products 
of material nature. 
PURPORT 
By this knowledge, the body, the field of activities and the knowers of 
the body (both the individual soul and the Supersoul) can be known. The 
body is the field of activity and is composed of material nature. It is the 
individual soul which is embodied. Enjoying the activities of the body is 
the puru§a, or the living entity. He is one knower, and the other is the 
Supersoul. Of course, it is to be understood that both the Supersoul and 
the individual entity are different manifestations of the Supreme Person­
ality of Godhead. The living entity is in the category of His energy, and 
the Supersoul is in the category of His personal expansion. 
Both material nature and the living entity are eternal. That is to say 
that they existed before the creation. The material manifestation is from 
the energy of the Supreme Lord and so also are the living entities, but 
they are of the superior energy. Both of them existed before this cosmos 
was manifested. Material nature was absorbed in the Supreme Personality 
of Godhead, Maha-Vi�I]U, and when it was required, it was manifested by 
the agency of mahat-tattva. Similarly, the living entities are also in Him, 
and because they are conditioned, they are adverse to serving the Supreme 
Lord. Thus they are not allowed to enter into the spiritual sky. After the 
winding up of material nature, these living entities are again given a chance 
to act in the material world and prepare themselves to enter into the 
spiritual world. That is the mystery of this material creation. Actual_ly the 
living entity is originally the spiritual part and parcel of the Supreme 
Lord, but due to his rebellious nature, he is conditioned within material 
nature. It really does not matter how these living entities or superior 
entities of the Supreme Lord have come in contact with material nature. 
The Supreme Personality of Godhead knows, however, how and why this 
actually took place. In the scriptures the Lord says that those attracted by 
this material nature are undergoing a hard struggle for existence. But we 
should know it with certainty from the descriptions of these few verses 
that all the transformations and influences of material nature by the three 
I

modes are also productions of material nature. All transformations and 
variety in respect to living entities are due to the body. As far as spirit is 
concerned, living entities are all the same.

TRANSLATION 
Nature is said to be the cause of all material activities and effects, 
whereas the living entity is the cause of the various sufferings and enjoy­
ments in this world. 
PURPORT 
The different manifestations of body and senses among the living entities 
are due to material nature. There are 8,400,000 different species of life, 
and these varieties are the creation of the material nature. They arise from 
the different sensual pleasures of the living entity, who thus desires to live 
in this body or that. When he is put into different bodies, he enjoys dif­
ferent kinds of happiness and distress. His material happiness and distress 
are due to his body, and not to himself as he is. In his original state there 
is no doubt of enjoyment; therefore that is his real state. Because of the 
desire to lord it over material nature, he is in the material world. In the 
' 
I, 
'l 
646 
Bhagavad-gita As It Is 
[Ch. 13 
spiritual world there is no such thing. The spiritual world is pure, but in the 
material world everyone is struggling hard to acquire victims who present 
different pleasures to the body. It might be more clear to state that this 
body is the effect of the senses. The senses are instruments for gratifying 
desire. Now, the sum total-body and instrument senses-are offered by 
material nature, and, as will be clear in the next verse, the living entity is 
blessed or damned with circumstances according to his past desire and 
activity. According to one's desires and activities, material nature places 
one in various residential quarters. The being himself is the cause of his 
attaining such residential quarters and his attendant enjoyment or suffer­
ing. Once placed in some particular kind of body, he comes under the 
control of nature because the body, being matter, acts according to the 
laws of nature. At that time, the living entity has no power to change that 
law. Suppose an entity is put into the body of a dog. As soon as he is put 
into the body of a dog, he must act like a dog. He cannot act otherwise. 
And if the living entity is put into the body of a hog, then he is forced to 
eat stool and act like a hog. Similarly, if the living entity is put into the 
body of a demigod, he must act according to his body. This is the law of 
nature. But in all circumstances, the Supersoul is with the individual soul. 
That is explained in the Vedas as follows: dvii suparrii sayujii sakhiiyii. The 
Supreme Lord is so kind upon the living entity that He always accompanies 
the individual soul and in all circumstances is present as the Supersoul or 
Paramatma.

TRANSLATION 
The living entity in material nature thus follows the ways of life, 
enjoying the three modes of nature. This is due to his association with 
that material nature. Thus he meets with good and evil amongst various 
species. 
PURPORT 
This verse is very important for an understanding of how the living 
entities transmigrate from one body to another. It is explained in the 
Second Chapter that the living entity is transmigrating from one body to 
another j ust as one changes dress. This change of dress is due to his attach­
ment to material existence. As long as he is captivated by this false mani­
festation, he has to continue transmigrating from one body to another. Due 
to his desire to lord it over material nature, he is put into such undesirable 
circumstances. Under the influence of material desire, the entity is born 
sometimes as a demigod, sometimes as a man, sometimes as a beast, as a 
bird, as a worm, as an aquatic, as a saintly man, as a bug. This is going on. 
And in all cases the living entity thinks himself to be the master of his 
circumstances, yet he is under the influence of material nature. 
How he is put into such different bodies is explained here. It is due to 
association with the different modes of nature. One has to rise, therefore, 
above the three material modes and become situated in the transcendental 
position. That is called Kn;Q.a consciousness. Unless one is situated in Kn;Q.a 
consciousness, his material consciousness will oblige him to transfer from 
one body to another because he has material desires since time immemorial. 
But he has to change that conception. That change can be effected only by 
hearing from authoritative sources. The best example is here: Arjuna is 
hearing the science of God from Kn;Q.a. The living entity, if he submits to 
this hearing process, will lose his long-cherished desire to dominate material 
nature, and gradually and proportionately, as he reduces his long desire to 
dominate, he comes to enjoy spiritual happiness. In a Vedic mantra it is 
said that as he becomes learned in association with the Supreme Personality 
of Godhead, he proportionately relishes his eternal blissful life.

TRANSLATION 
Yet in this body there is another, a transcendental enjoyer who is the 
Lord, the supreme proprietor, who exists as the overseer and permitter, 
and who is known as the Supersoul. 
PURPORT 
It is stated here that the Supersoul, who is always with the individual 
soul, is the representation of the Supreme Lord. He is not an ordinary 
living entity. Because the monist philosophers take the knower of the body 
to be one, they think that there is no difference between the Supersoul and 
the individual soul. To clarify this, the Lord says that He is the representa­
tion of Paramatma in every body. He is different from the individual soul; 
He is para[!,, transcendental. The individual soul enjoys the activities of a 
particular field, but the Supersoul is present not as finite enjoyer nor as 
one taking part in bodily activities, but as the witness, overseer, permitter 
and supreme enjoyer. His name is Paramatma, not iitmii, and He is tran­
scendental. It is distinctly clear that the iitmii and Paramatma are different. 
The Supersoul, the Paramatma, has legs and hands everywhere, but the 
individual soul does not. And because He is the Supreme Lord, He is present 
within to sanction the individual soul's desiring material enjoyment. With­
out the sanction of the Supreme Soul, the individual soul cannot do any­
thing. The individual is bhakta or the sustained, and He is bhukta or the 
Text 24) 
Nature, the Enjoyer, and Consciousness 
649 
maintainer. There are innumerable living entities, and He is staying in them 
as a friend. 
The fact is that individual living entities are eternally part and parcel of 
the Supreme Lord, and both of them are very intimately related as friends. 
But the living entity has the tendency to reject the sanction of the Supreme 
Lord and act independently in an attempt to dominate the supreme nature, 
and because he has this tendency, he is called the marginal energy of the 
Supreme Lord. The living entity can be situated either in the material 
energy or the spiritual energy. As long as he is conditioned by the material 
energy, the Supreme Lord, as his friend, the Supersoul, stays with him 
just to get him to return to the spiritual energy. The Lord is always eager 
to take him back to the spiritual energy, but due to his minute indepen­
dence, the individual entity is continually rejecting the association of spiri­
tual light. This misuse of independence is the cause of his material strife in 
the conditioned nature. The Lord, therefore, is always giving instruction 
from within and from without. From without He gives instructions as 
stated in Bhagavad-gitii, and from within He tries to convince him that his 
activities in the material field are not conducive to real happiness. "Just 
give it up and turn your faith toward Me. Then you will be happy," He 
says. Thus the intelligent person who places his faith in the Paramatma or 
the Supreme Personality of Godhead begins to advance toward a blissful 
eternal life of knowledge.

TRANSLATION 
One who understands this philosophy concerning material nature, the 
living entity and the interaction of the modes of nature is sure to attain 
liberation. He will not take birth here again, regardless of his present 
position. 
PURPORT 
Clear understanding of material nature, the Supersoul, the individual 
soul and their interrelation makes one eligible to become liberated and 
turn to the spiritual atmosphere without being forced to return to this 
material nature_ This is the result of knowledge. The purpose of knowledge 
is to understand distinctly that the living entity has by chance fallen into 
this material existence. By his personal endeavor in association with 
authorities, saintly persons and a spiritual master, he has to understand 
his position and then revert to spiritual consciousness or Kr��a conscious­
ness by understanding Bhagavad-gitii as it is explained by the Personality of 
Godhead. Then it is certain that he will never come again into this material 
existence; he will be transferred into the spiritual world for a blissful eter­
nal life of knowledge.

TRANSLATION 
That Supersoul is perceived by some through meditation, by some 
through the cultivation of knowledge, and by others through working 
without fruitive desire. 
PURPORT 
The Lord informs Arjuna that the conditioned soul can be divided into 
two classes as far as man's search for self-realization is concerned. Those 
who are atheists, agnostics and skeptics are beyond the sense of spiritual 
understanding. But there are others who are faithful in their understanding 
of spiritual life, and they are called workers who have renounced fruitive 
results. Those who always try to establish the doctrine of monism are also 
counted among the atheists and agnostics. In other words, only the devo­
tees of the Supreme Personality of Godhead are really capable of spiritual 
understanding because they understand that beyond this material nature 
there is the spiritual world and the Supreme Personality of Godhead who 
is expanded as the Paramatma, the Supersoul in everyone, the all-pervading 
Godhead. Of course there are those who try to understand the Supreme 
Absolute Truth by cultivation of knowledge, and they can be counted in 
the second class. The atheistic philosophers analyze this material world 
into twenty-four elements, and they place the individual soul as the twenty­
fifth item. When they are able to understand the nature of the individual 
soul to be transcendental to the material elements, they are able to under­
stand also that above the individual soul there is the Supreme Personality 
of Godhead. He is the twenty-sixth element. Thus gradually they also come 
to the standard of devoti9nal service in Kr�IJ.a consciousness. Those who 
work without fruitive results are also perfect in their attitude. They are 
given a chance to advance to the platform of devotional service in Kr�IJ.a 
consciousness. Here it is stated that there are some people who are pure in 
consciousness and who try to find out the Supersoul by meditation, and 
when they discover the Supersoul within themselves, they become tran­
scendentally situated. Similarly, there are others who also try to understand 
the Supreme Soul by cultivation of knowledge, and there are others who 
cultivate the hatha-yoga system and who try to satisfy the Supreme Per­
sonality of Godhead by childish activities.

TRANSLATION 
Again there are those who, although not conversant in spiritual know­
ledge, begin to worship the Supreme Person upon hearing about Him from 
others. Because of their tendency to hear from authorities, they also 
transcend the path of birth and death. 
PURPORT 
This verse is particularly applicable to modern soci�ty because in modern 
society there is practically no education in spiritual matters. Some of the 
people may appear to be atheistic or agnostic or philosophical, but actually 
there is no knowledge of philosophy. As for the common man, if he is a 
good soul, then there is a chance for advancement by hearing. This hearing 
process is very important. Lord Caitanya, who preached Kr�J).a conscious­
ness in the modern world, gave great stress to hearing because if the com­
mon man simply hears from authoritative sources, he can progress, espe­
cially, according to Lord Caitanya, if he hears the transcendental vibration 
Hare Kn;J).a, Hare Kr�J).a, Kr�J).a Kr�J).a, Hare Hare/Hare Rama, Hare Rama, 
Rama Rama, Hare Hare. It is stated, therefore, that all men should take 
advantage of hearing from realized souls and gradually become able to 
understand everything. The worship of the Supreme Lord will then un­
doubtedly take place. Lord Caitanya has said that in this age no one needs 
to change his position, but one should give up the endeavor to understand 
the Absolute Truth by speculative reasoning. One should learn to become 
the servant of those who are in knowledge of the Supreme Lord. If one is 
· fortunate enough to take shelter of a pure devotee, hear from him about 
self-realization and follow in his footsteps, he will be gradually elevated to 
the position of a pure devotee. In this verse particularly the process of 
'
.
 
Text 27] 
Nature, the Enjoyer, and Consciousness 
653 
hearing is strongly recommended, and this is very appropriate. Although 
the common man is often not as capable as so-called philosophers, faithful 
hearing from an authoritative person will help one transcend this material 
existence and go hack to Godhead, hack to home.

0 chief of the Bhiiratas, whatever you see in existence, both moving

PURPORT 
Both material nature and the living entity, which were existing before 
the cn:!ttion of the cosmos, are explained in this verse. Whatever is created 
is hut a combination of the living entity and material nature. There are 
many manifestations like trees, mountains and hills, which are not moving, 
and there are many existences which are moving, and all of them are hut 
combinations of material nature and superior nature, the living entity. 
Without the touch of the superior nature, the living entity, nothing can 
grow. Therefore the relationship between matter and nature is eternally 
going on, and this combination is effected by the Supreme Lord; therefore 
He is the controller of both the superior and inferior natures. The material 
654 
Bhagavad -glta As It Is 
[Ch. 13 
nature is created by Him, and the superior nature is placed in this material 
nature, and thus all these activities and manifestations take place.

One who sees the Supersoul accompanying the individual soul in all

ever destroyed, actually sees. 
PURPORT 
Anyone who can see three things-the body, the proprietor of the body, 
or individual soul, and the friend of the individual soul, combined together 
by good association-is actually in knowledge. Those who are not asso­
ciated with the soul's friend are ignorant; they simply see the body, and 
when the body is destroyed they think that everything is finished, but 
actually it is not so. After the destruction of the body, both the soul and 
the Supersoul exist, and they go on eternally in many various moving and 
unmoving forms. The Sanskrit word paramesvaram is sometimes translated 
as the individual soul because the soul is the master of the body, and after 
the destruction of the body he transfers to another form. In that way he is 
master. But there are others who interpret this paramesvaram to be the 
Supersoul. In either case, both the Supersoul and the indi,"idual soul con-,

One who sees the Supersoul in every living being and equal everywhere

PURPORT 
The living entity, by accepting his material existence as just so much 
suffering, can become situated in his spiritual existence. If one understands 
that the Supreme is situated in His Paramatma manifestation everywhere, 
that is, if one can see the presence of the Supreme Personality of Godhead 
in every living thing, he does not degrade himself, and he therefore gradual· 
ly advances in the spiritual world. The mind is generally addicted to self­
centered processes; but when the mind turns to the Supersoul, one becomes 
advanced in spiritual understanding.

One who can see that all activities are performed by the body, which is

PURPORT 
This body is made by material nature under the direction of the Super­
soul, and whatever activities are going on in respect to one's body are not 
his doing. Whatever one is supposed to do, either for happiness or for dis­
tress, one is forced to do because of the bodily constitution. The self, 
however, is outside all these bodily activities. This body is given according 
to one's past desires. To fulfill desires, one is given the body, with which he 
acts accordingly. Practically speaking, the body is a machine, designed by 
the Supreme Lord, to fulfill desires. Because of desires, one is put into 
difficult circumstances to suffer or to enjoy. This transcendental vision of 
the living entity, when developed, makes one separate from bodily activi­
ties. One who has such a vision is an actual seer.

TRANSLATION 
When a sensible man ceases to see different identities, which are due to 
different material bodies, he attains to the Brahman conception. Thus he 
sees that beings are expanded everywhere. 
PURPORT 
When one can see that the various bodies of living entities arise due to 
the different desires of the individual soul and do not actually belong to 
the soul itself, one actually sees. In the material conception of life, we find 
someone a demigod, someone a human being, a dog, a cat, etc. This is 
material vision, not actual vision. This material differentiation is due to a 
material conception of life. After the destruCtion of the material body, 
this spirit soul is one. The spirit soul, due to contact with material nature, 
gets different types of bodies. When one can see this, he attains spiritual 
vision; thus being freed from differentiations like man, animal, big, low, 
etc., one becomes beautified in his consciousness and able to develop Kr�.r;ta 
consciousness in his spiritual identity. How he then sees things will be 
explained in the next verse.

TRANSLATION 
Those with the vision of eternity can see that the soul is transcendental, 
eternal, and beyond the modes of nature. Despite contact with the material 
body, 0 Arjuna, the soul neither does anything nor is entangled. 
PURPORT 
A living entity appears to be born because of the birth of the material 
body, but actually the living entity is eternal; he is not born, and in spite 
of his being situated in a material body, he is transcendental and eternal. 
Thus he cannot be destroyed. By nature he is full of bliss. He does not 
engage himself in any material activities; therefore the activities performed 
due to his contact with material bodies do not entangle him.

Nature, the Enjoyer, and Consciousness 
659 
PURPORT 
The air enters into water, mud, stool and whatever else is there; still it 
does not mix with anything. Similarly, the living entity, even though situ­
ated in varieties of bodies, is aloof from them due to his subtle nature. 
Therefore it is impossible to see with the material eyes how the living 
entity is in contact with this body and how he is out of it after the destruc­
tion of the body. No one in science can ascertain this.

0 son of Bharata, as the sun alone illuminates all this universe, so does 
the living entity, one within the body, illuminate the entire body by 
consciousness. 
PURPORT 
There are various theories regarding consciousness. Here in Bhagavad­
gitii the example of the sun and the sunshine is given. As the sun is situated 
in one place, but is illuminating the whole universe, so a small particle of 
spirit soul, although situated in the heart of this body, is illuminating the 
whole body by consciousness. Thus consciousness is the proof of the pres­
ence of the soul, as sunshine or light is the proof of the presence of the sun.

Bhagavad-gita As It Is 
[Ch. 13. 
When the soul is present in the body, there is consciousness all over the 
body, and as soon as the soul has passed from the body, there is no more 
consciousness. This can be easily understood by any intelligent man. There­
fore consciousness is not a production of the combinations of matter. It is 
the symptom of the living entity. The consciousness of the living entity, 
although qualitatively one with the supreme consciousness, is not supreme 
because the consciousness of one particular body does not share that of 
another body. But the Supersoul, which is situated in all bodies as the 
friend of the individual soul, is conscious of all bodies. That is the differ­
ence between supreme consciousness and individual consciousness.

PURPORT 
The purport of this Thirteenth Chapter is that one should know the 
distinction between the body, the owner of the body, and the Supersoul. 
A faithful person should at first ha�e some good association to hear of God 
Text 35] 
Nature, the Enjoyer, and Consciousness 
661 
and thus gradually become enlightened. If one accepts a spiritual master, 
he can learn to distinguish between matter and spirit, and that becomes 
the steppingstone for further spiritual realization. A spiritual master teaches 
his students to get free from the material concept of life by various instruc­
tions. For instance, in Bhagavad-gitii we find Kr�IJ.a instructing Arjuna to 
free him from materialistic considerations. 
One can understand that this body is matter; it can be analyzed with its 
twenty-four elements. That is the gross manifestation. And the subtle 
manifestation is the mind and psychological effects. And the symptoms of 
life are the interaction of these features. But over and above this, there is 
the soul, and there is also the Supersoul. The soul and the Supersoul are 
two. This material world is working by the conjunction of the soul and 
the twenty-four material elements. One who can see the constitution of 
the whole material manifestation as this combination of the soul and mate­
rial elements and also can see the situation of the Supreme Soul becomes 
eligible for transfer to the spiritual world. These things are meant for 
contemplation and for realization, and one should have a complete under­
standing of this chapter with the help of the spiritual master. 
Thus end the Bhaktivedanta Purports to the Thirteenth Chapter of the 
Snmad-Bhagavad-gitli in the matter of Nature, the Enjoyer, and Conscious­
ness.

TRANSLATION 
The Blessed Lord said: Again I shall declare to you this supreme wisdom, 
the best of all knowledge, knowing which all the sages have attained to 
supreme perfection: 
PURPORT 
From the Seventh Chapter to the end of the Twelfth Chapter, Sri Kr�r;ta 
in detail reveals the Absolute Truth, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. 
Now, the Lord Himself is further enlightening Arjuna. If one understands 
this chapter through the process of philosophical speculation, he will come 
to an understanding of devotional service. In the Thirteenth Chapter, it 
was clearly explained that by humbly developing knowledge one may 
possibly be freed from material entanglement. It has also been explained 
that it is due to association with the modes of nature that the living entity 
is entangled in this material world. Now, in this chapter, the Supreme 
Personality explains what those modes of nature are, how they act, how 
they bind and how they give liberation. The knowledge explained in 
this chapter is proclaimed by the Supreme Lord to be superior to the 
knowledge given so far in other chapters. By understanding this knowledge, 
various great sages attain perfection and transfer to the spiritual world. 
The Lord now explains the same knowledge in a better way. This know­
ledge is far, far superior to all other processes of knowledge thus far 
explained, and knowing this many attain perfection. Thus it is expected 
that one who understands this Fourteenth Chapter will attain perfection.

TRANSLATION 
By becoming fixed in this knowledge, one can attain to the transcen­
dental nature, which is like My own nature. Thus established, one is not 
hom at the time of creation nor disturbed at the time of dissolution. 
PURPORT 
After acquiring perfect transcendental knowledge, one acquires qualita­
tive equality with the Supreme Personality of Godhead, becoming free 
from the repetition of birth and death. One does not, however, lose his 
identity as an individual soul. It is understood from Vedic literature that 
the liberated souls who have reached the transcendental planets of the 
spiritual sky always look to the lotus feet of the Supreme Lord, being 
engaged in His transcendental loving service. So, even after liberation, the 
devotees do not lose their individual identities. 
Generally, in the material world, whatever knowledge we get is con­
taminated by the three modes of material nature. But knowledge which is 
not contaminated by the three modes of nature is called transcendental 
knowledge. As soon as one is situated in that transcendental knowledge, 
he is on the same platform as that of the Supreme Person. Those who have 
no knowledge of the spiritual sky hold that after being freed from the 
material activities of the material form, this spiritual identity becomes 
formless, without any variegatedness. However, just as there is material 
variegatedness in this world, so, in the spiritual world, there is also varie­
gatedness. Those in ignorance of this think that spiritual existence is 
opposed to material variety. But actually, in the spiritual sky, one attains 
spiritual form. There are spiritual activities, and the spiritual situation is 
called devotional life. That atmosphere is said to be uncontaminated, and 
there one is equal in quality with the Supreme Lord. To obtain such know­
ledge, one must develop all the spiritual qualities. One who thus develops 
the spiritual qualities is not affected either by the creation or the destruc­
tion of the material world.

TRANSLATION 
The total material substance, called Brahman, is the source of birth, 
and it is that Brahman that I impregnate, making possible the births of all 
living beings, 0 son of Bharata. 
PURPORT 
This is an explanation of the world: everything that takes place is due 
to the combination of k§etra and k§etrajiia, the body and the spirit soul. 
This combination of material nature and the living entity is made possible 
by the Supreme God Himself. The mahat-tattva is the total cause of the 
total cosmic manifestation, and because in the total substance of the 
material cause there are three modes of nature, it is sometimes called 
Brahman. The Supreme Personality impregnates that total substance, and 
thus innumerable universes become possible. This total material sub­
stance, the mahat-tattva, is described as Brahman in the Vedic literature: 
tasmiid etad brahma niima-riipam annam ca jiiyate. Into that Brahman the 
seeds of the living entities are impregnated by the Supreme Person. The 
twenty-four elements, beginning from earth, water, fire and air, are all 
material energy, called Mahii-brahman, or the great Brahman, the material 
nature. As is explained in the Seventh Chapter, beyond this there is 
another, superior nature-the living entity. In material nature the superior

nature is mixed by the will of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and 
thereafter all living entities are born of this material nature. 
The scorpion lays its eggs in piles of rice, and sometimes it is said that 
the scorpion is born out of rice. But the rice is not the cause of the scor­
pion. Actually, the eggs were laid by the mother. Similarly, material 
nature is not the cause of the birth of the living entities. The seed is given 
by the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and they only seem to come out 
as products of material nature. Thus every living entity, according to his 
past activities, has a different body, created by this material nature, and 
the entity can enjoy or suffer according to his past deeds. The Lord is the 
cause of all the manifestations of living entities in this material world.

head, Kr�IJ.a, is the original father of all living entities. The living entities

within the earth there are living entities, even within water and within 
fire. All these appearances are due to the mother, material nature, and 
Kr�l)a's seed-giving process. The purport is that the living entities, being 
impregnated in the material world, come out and form at the time of 
creation according to their past deeds.

Material nature consists of the three modes-goodness, passion and

comes conditioned by these modes. 
PURPORT 
The living entity, because he is transcendental, has nothing to do with 
this material nature. Still, because he has become conditioned by the 
material world, he is acting under the spell of the three modes of material 
nature. Because living entities have different kinds of bodies, in terms of 
the different aspects of nature, they are induced to act according to that 
nature. This is the cause of the varieties of happiness and distress.

TRANSLATION 
0 sinless one, the mode of goodness, being purer than the others, is 
illuminating, and it frees one from all sinful reactions. Those situated in 
that mode develop knowledge, hut they become conditioned by the 
concept of happiness. 
PURPORT 
The living entities conditioned by material nature are of various types. 
One is happy, another is very active, and another is helpless. All these 
types of psychological manifestations are causes of the entities' conditioned 
status in nature. How they are differently conditioned is explained in this 
section of Bhagavad-gitii. The mode of goodness is first considered. The 
effect of developing the mode of goodness in the material world is that 
one becomes wiser than those otherwise conditioned. A man in the mode 
of goodness is not so much affected by material miseries, and he has a 
sense of advancement in material knowledge. The representative type is the 
briihmarw, who is supposed to he situated in the mode of goodness. This . 
sense of happiness is due to understanding that, in the mode of goodness, 
one is more or less free from sinful reactions. Actually, in the Vedic 
literature it is said that the mode of goodness means greater knowledge 
and a greater sense of happiness. 
· 
.' 
670 
Bhagavad-gita As It Is 
[Ch. 14 
The difficulty here is that when a living entity is situated in the mode 
of goodness, he becomes conditioned to feel that he is advanced in know­
ledge and is better than others. In this way he becomes conditioned. The 
best examples are the scientist and philosopher: each is very proud of his 
knowledge, and because they generally improve their living conditions, 
··• 
_, 
they feel a sort of material happiness. This sense of advanced happiness in 
conditioned life makes them bound by the mode of goodness of material 
nature. As such, they are attracted toward working in the mode of good­
ness, and, as long as they have an attraction for working in that way, they 
have to take some type of body in the modes of nature. Thus there is no 
likelihood of liberation, or of being transferred to the spiritual world. 
Repeatedly, one may become a philosopher, a scientist, or a poet, and, 
repeatedly, become entangled in' the same disadvantages of birth and death. 
But, due to the illusion of the material energy, one thinks that that sort 
of life is pleasant.

The Three Modes of Material Nature 
671 
This is called the mode of passion. And, when the mode of passion is 
increased, one develops the hankering for material enjoyment. He wants 
to enjoy sense gratification. For sense gratification, a man in the mode of 
passion wants some honor in society, or in the nation, and he wants to have 
a happy family, with nice children, wife, and house. These are the products 
of the mode of passion. As long as one is hankering after these things, he 
has to work very hard. Therefore it is clearly stated here that he becomes 
associated with the fruits of his activities and thus becomes bound by such 
activities. In order to please his wife, children and society and to keep up 
his prestige, one has to work. Therefore, the whole material world is more 
or less in the mode of passion. Modern civilization is considered to be 
advanced in the standards of the mode of passion. Formerly, the advanced 
condition was considered to be in the mode of goodness. If there is no 
liberation for those in the mode of goodness, what of those who are 
entangled in the mode of passion?

TRANSLATION 
0 son of Bharata, the mode of ignorance causes the delusion of all living 
entities. The result of this mode is madness, indolence and sleep, which 
hind the conditioned soul. 
PURPORT 
In this verse the specific application of the word tu is very significant. 
This means that the mode of ignorance is a very peculiar qualification of 
672 
Bhagavad-gita As It Is 
[Ch. 14 
the embodied soul. This mode of ignorance is just the opposite of the 
mode of goodness. In the mode of goodness, by development of knowledge, 
one can understand what is what, . but the mode of ignorance is just the 
opposite. Everyone under the spell of the mode of ignorance becomes 
mad, and a madman cannot understand what is what. Instead of making 
advancement, one becomes degraded. The definition of the mode of 
ignorance is stated in the Vedic literature: under the spell of ignorance, 
one cannot understand the thing as it is. For example, everyone can see 
that his grandfather has died, and therefore he will also die; man is 
mortal. The children that he conceives will also die. So death is sure. Still, 
people are madly accumulating money and working very hard all day and 
night, not caring for the eternal spirit. This is madness. In their madness, 
they are very reluctant to make advancement in spiritual understanding. 
Such people are very lazy. When they are invited to associate for spiritual 
understanding, they are not much interested. They are not even active like 
the man who is controlled by the mode of passion. Thus another symptom 
of one embedded in the mode of ignorance is that he sleeps more than is 
required. Six hours of sleep is sufficient, but a man in the mode of 
ignorance sleeps at least ten or twelve hours a day. Such a man appears to 
be always dejected, and is addicted to intoxicants and sleeping. These are 
the symptoms of a person conditioned by the mode of ignorance.

The Three Modes of Material Nature 
673 
PURPORT 
A person in the mode of goodness is satisfied by his work or intellectual 
pursuit, just as a philosopher, scientist, or educator may be engaged in a 
particular field of knowledge and may be satisfied in that way. A man in 
the modes of passion and goodness may be engaged in fruitive activity; he 
owns as much as he can and spends for good causes. Sometimes.he tries to 
open hospitals, give to charity institutions, etc. These are the signs of one 
in the mode of passion. And the mode of ignorance covers knowledge. In 
the mode of ignorance, whatever one does is neither good for him nor for 
anyone.

Sometimes the mode of passion becomes prominent, defeating the mode

defeats passion, and at other times the mode of ignorance defeats goodness 
and passion. In this way there is always competition for supremacy.

ignorance are defeated. When the mode of goodness is prominent, passion

and ignorance are defeated. And, when the mode of ignorance is promi­
nent, passion and goodness are defeated. This competition is always going 
on. Therefore, one who is actually intent on advancing in Kr��a conscious­
ness has to transcend these three modes. The prominence of some certain 
mode of nature is manifested in one's dealings, in his activities, in eating, 
etc. All this will be explained in later chapters. But if one wants, he can 
develop, by practice, the mode of goodness and thus defeat the modes of 
ignorance and passion. One can similarly develop the mode of passion and 
· defeat goodness and ignorance. Or, one can develop the mode of ignorance 
and defeat goodness and passion. Although there are these three modes of 
material nature, if one is determined, he can be blessed by the mode of 
goodness, and, by transcending the mode of goodness, he can be situated 
in pure goodness, which is called the viisudeva state, a state in which one 
can understand the science of God. By the manifestation of particular 
activities, it can be understood in what mode of nature one is situated.

goodness is illuminated, it should be understood that one has developed 
the mode of goodness. In the mode of goodness, one can see things in the 
right position, one can hear things in the right position, and one can taste 
things in the right position. One becomes cleansed inside and outside. In 
every gate there is development of the symptoms of happiness, and that is 
the position of goodness.

One in the mode of passion is never satisfied with the position he has 
already acquired; he hankers to increase his position. If he wants to con­
struct a residential house, he tries his best to have a palatial house, as if 
he would be able to reside in that house eternally. And he develops a great 
hankering for sense gratification. There is no end to sense gratification. He 
always wants to remain with his family and in his house and to continue 
the process of sense gratification. There is no cessation of this. All these 
symptoms should be understood as characteristic of the mode of passion.

When there is no illumination, knowledge is absent. One in the mode of 
ignorance does not work by a regulative principle; he wants to act whim­
sically for no purpose. Even though he has the capacity to work, he makes 
·no endeavor. This is called illusion. Although consciousness is going on, 
life is inactive. These are the symptoms of one in the mode of ignorance.

cant; it means free from the modes of passion and ignorance. There are 
impurities in the material world, but the mode of goodness is the purest 
form of existence in the material world. There are different kinds of 
planets for different kinds of living entities. Those who die in the mode of 
goodness are elevated to the planets where great sages and great devotees 
live.

Bhagavad -glta As It Is 
[Ch. 14 . 
PURPORT 
Some people have the impression that when the soul reaches the plat­
form of human life, it never goes down again. This is incorrect. According 
to this verse, if one develops the mode of ignorance, after his death he is 
degraded to the animal form of life. From there one has to again elevate 
himself, by evolutionary process, to come again to the human form of life. 
Therefore, those who are actually serious about human life should take to 
the mode of goodness and in good association transcend the modes and 
- become situated in Kr�JJ.a consciousness. This is the aim of human life. 
Otherwise, there is no guarantee that the human being will again attain to 
the human status.

TRANSLATION 
By acting in the mode of goodness, one becomes purified. Works done 
in the mode of passion result in distress, and actions performed in the mode 
of ignorance result in foolishness. 
PURPORT 
By pious activities in the mode of goodness one is purified; therefore 
the sages, who are free from all illusion, are situated in happiness. Simi­
larly, activities in the mode of passion are simply miserable. Any activity 
for material happiness is bound to be defeated. If, for example, one wants 
Text 16] 
The Three Modes of Material Nature 
679 
to have a skyscraper, so much human misery has to he undergone before a 
big skyscraper can he built. The financier has to take much trouble to earn 
a mass of wealth, and those who are slaving to construct the building have 
to render physical toil. The miseries are there. Thus Bhagavad-gitii says that 
in any activity performed under the spell of the mode of passion, there is 
definitely great misery. There may he a little so-called mental happiness­
"! have this house or this money" -hut this is not actual happiness. As far 
as the mode of ignorance is concerned, the performer is without knowledge, 
and therefore all his activities result in present misery, and afterwards he 
will go on toward animal life. Animal life is always miserable, although, 
under the spell of the illusory energy, miiyii, the animals do not under­
stand this. Slaughtering poor animals is also due to the mode of ignorance. 
The animal killers do not know that in the future the animal will have a 
body suitable to kill them. That is the law of nature. In human society, 
if one kills a man he has to he hanged. That is the law of the state. Because 
of ignorance, people do not perceive that there is a complete state con­
trolled by the Supreme Lord. Every living creature is the son of the Su­
preme Lord, and He does not tolerate even an ant's being killed. One has 
to pay for it. So, indulgence in animal killing for the taste of the tongue is 
the grossest kind of ignorance. A human being has no need to kill animals 
because God has supplied so many nice things. If one indulges in meat­
eating anyway, it is to he understood that he is acting in ignorance and is 
making his future very dark. Of all kinds of animal killing, the killing of 
cows is most vicious because the cow gives us all kinds of pleasure by 
supplying milk. Cow slaughter is an act of the grossest type of ignorance. 
In the Vedic literature the words gobhi[l pripita-matsaram indicate that 
one who, being fully satisfied by milk, is desirous of killing the cow, is in 
the grossest ignorance. There is also a prayer in the Vedic literature that 
states: 
namo brahmapya-deviiya go-briihmapa-hitiiya ca 
jagaddhitiiya kr§piiya govindiiya namo namaft. 
"My Lord, You are the well-wisher of the cows and the briihmapas, and 
You are the well-wisher of the entire human society and world." The pur­
port is that special mention is given in that prayer for the protection of the 
cows and the briihmapas. Briihmapas are the symbol of spiritual education, 
and cows are the symbol of the most valuable food; these two living crea­
tures, the briihmapas and the cows, must he given all protection-that is 
real advancement of civilization. In modern human society, spiritual know­
ledge is neglected, and cow killing is encouraged. It is to he understood, 
•
680 
�hagavad-g1ta As It Is 
[Ch. 14 
then, that human society is advancing in the wrong direction and is clearing 
the path to its own condemnation. A civilization which guides the citizens 
to become animals in their next lives is certainly not a human civilization. 
The present human civilization is, of course, grossly misled by the modes 
of passion and ignorance. It is a very dangerous age, and all nations should 
take care to provide the easiest process, Kr�Q.a consciousness, to save 
humanity from the greatest danger.

TRANSLATION 
From the mode of goodness, real knowledge develops; from the mode 
of passion, grief develops; and from the mode of ignorance, foolishness, 
madness and illusion develop. 
PURPORT 
Since the present civilization is not very congenial to the living entities, 
Kr�Q.a consciousness is recommended. Through Kr�Q.a consciousness, society 
will develop the mode of goodness. When the mode of goodness is devel­
oped, people. will see things as they are. In the mode of ignorance, people 
are just like animals and cannot see things clearly. In the mode of ignorance, 
for example, they do not see that by killing one animal they are taking a 
chance of being killed by the same animal in the next life. Because people 
have no education in actual knowledge, they become irresponsible. To 
stop this irresponsibility, education for developing the mode of goodness 
of the people in general must be there. When they are actually educated in 
Text 18) 
' 
I 
The Three Modes of Material Nature 
681 
the mode of goodness, they will become sober, in full knowledge of 
things as they are. Then people will be happy and prosperous. Even if the 
majority of the people aren't happy and prosperous, if a certain percentage 
of the population develops Kr�JJa consciousness and becomes situated in 
the mode of goodness, then there is the possibility for peace and prosperity 
all over the world. Otherwise, if the world is devoted to the modes of 
passion and ignorance, there can be no peace or prosperity. In the mode of 
passion, people become greedy, and their hankering for sense enjoyment 
has no limit. One can see that even if one has enough money and adequate 
arrangement for sense gratification, there is neither happiness nor peace of 
mind. That is not possible because one is situated in the mode of passion. 
If one wants happiness at all, his money will not help him; he has to elevate 
himself to the mode of goodness by practicing Kr�JJa consciousness. One 
engaged in the mode of passion is not only mentally unhappy, but his pro­
fession and occupation are also very troublesome. He has to devise so many 
plans and schemes to acquire enough money to maintain his status quo. 
This is all miserable. In the mode of ignorance, people become mad. Being 
distressed by their circumstances, they take shelter of intoxication, and 
thus they sink further into ignorance. Their future in life is very dark.

Bhagavad-glta As It Is 
[Ch. 14 
. 
PURPORT 
In this verse the results of actions in the three modes of nature are 
more explicitly set forth. There is an upper planetary system, consisting of 
the heavenly planets, where everyone is highly elevated. According to the 
degree of development of the mode of goodness, the living entity can be 
transferred to various planets in this system. The highest planet is Satya­
loka, or Brahmaloka, where the prime person of this universe, Lord Brahmii, 
resides. We have seen already that we can hardly calculate the wondrous 
condition of life in Brahmaloka, but the highest condition of life, the 
mode of goodness, can bring us to this. 
The mode of passion is mixed. It is in the middle, between the modes of 
goodness and ignorance. A person is not always pure, but even if he should 
be purely in the mode of passion, he will simply remain on this earth as a 
king or a rich man. But because there are mixtures, one can also go down. 
People on this earth, in the modes of passion or ignorance, cannot forcibly 
approach the higher planets by machine. In the mode of passion, there is 
also the chance of becoming mad in the next life. 
The lowest quality, the mode of ignorance, is described here as abomin­
able. The result of developing ignorance is very, very risky. It is the lowest 
quality in material nature. Beneath the human level there are eight million 
species of life: birds, beasts, reptiles, trees, etc., and, according to the 
development of the mode of ignorance, people are brought down to these 
abominable conditions. The word tiimasii� is very significant here. Tiimasii� 
indicates those who stay continually in the mode of ignorance without 
rising to a higher mode. Their future is very dark. 
There is opportunity for men in the modes of ignorance and passion to 
be elevated to the mode of goodness, and that system is called Kr�va con­
sciousness. But one who does not take advantage of this opportunity 
certainly will continue in the lower modes.

TRANSLATION 
When you see that there is nothing beyond these modes of nature in all 
activities and that the Supreme Lord is transcendental to all these modes, 
then you can know My spiritual nature. 
PURPORT 
One can transcend all the activities of the modes of material nature 
simply by understanding them properly by learning from the proper souls. 
The real spiritual master is Kr�v.a, and He is imparting this spiritual know­
ledge to Arjuna. Similarly, it is from those who are fully in Kr�v.a con­
sciousness that one has to learn this science of activities in terms of the 
modes of nature. Otherwise, one's life will be misdirected. By the instruc-
. tion of a bona fide spiritual master, a living entity can know of his spiritual 
position, his material body, his senses, how he is entrapped, and how he 
is under the spell of the material modes of nature. He is helpless, being in 
the grip of these modes, but when he can see his real position, then he can 
attain to the transcendental platform, having the scope for spiritual life. 
Actually, the living entity is not the performer of different activities. He 
is forced to act because he is situated in a particular type of body, con­
ducted by some particular mode of material nature. Unless one has the 
help of spiritual authority, he cannot understand in what position he is 
actually situated. With the association of a bona fide spiritual master, 
he can see his real position, and, by such an understanding, he can become 
fixed in full Kr�v.a consciousness. A man in Kr�v.a consciousness is not 
controlled by the spell of the material modes of nature. It has already been 
stated in the Seventh Chapter that one who has surrendered to Kr�v.a is 
relieved from the activities of material nature. Therefore for one who is 
able to see things as they are, the influence of material nature gradually 
ceases.

TRANSLATION 
When the embodied being is able to transcend these three modes, he 
can become free from birth, death, old age and their distresses and can 
enjoy nectar even in this life. 
PURPORT 
How one can stay in the transcendental position, even in this body, in 
full Kr�!Ja consciousness, is explained in this verse. The Sanskrit word 
dehi means embodied. Although one is within this material body, by his 
advancement in spiritual knowledge he can be free from the influence of 
the modes of nature. He can enjoy the happiness of spiritual life even in 
this body because, after leaving this body, he is certainly going to the 
spiritual sky. But even in this body he can enjoy spiritual happiness. In 
other words, devotional service in Kr�!Ja consciousness is the sign of 
liberation from this material entanglement, and this will be explained 
in the Eighteenth Chapter. When one is freed from the influence of the 
modes of material nature, he enters into devotional service.

TRANSLATION 
Arjuna inquired: 0 my dear Lord, by what symptoms is one known who 
is transcendental to those modes? What is his behavior? And how does he 
transcend the modes of nature? 
PURPORT 
In this verse, Arjuna's questions are very appropriate. He wants to know 
the symptoms of a person who has already transcended the material modes. 
He first inquires of the symptoms of such a transcendental person. How 
can one understand that he has already transcended the influence of the 
modes of material nature? The second question asks how he lives and what 
his activities are. Are they regulated or nonregulated? Then A�una 
inquires of the means by which he can attain the transcendental nature. 
That is very important. Unless one knows the direct means by which one 
can be situated always transcendentally, there is no possibility of showing 
the symptoms. So all these questions put by Arjuna are very important, 
and the Lord answers them.

The Three Modes of Material Nature 
687 
TRANSLATION 
The Blessed Lord said: He who does not hate illumination, attachment 
and delusion when they are present, nor longs for them when they 
disappear; who is seated like one unconcerned, being situated beyond 
these material reactions of the modes of nature, who remains firm, 
knowing that the modes alone are active; who regards alike pleasure and 
pain, and looks on a clod, a stone and a piece of gold with an equal eye; 
who is wise and holds praise and blame to be the same; who is unchanged 
in honor and dishonor, who treats friend and foe alike, who has abandoned 
all fruitive undertakings-such a man is said to have transcended the 
· 
modes of nature. 
PURPORT 
Arjuna submitted the three different questions, and the Lord answers 
them one after another. In these verses, Kr�l).a first indicates that a person 
transcendentally situated neither envies anyone nor hankers for anything. 
When a living entity stays in this material world embodied by the material 
body, it is to be understood that he is under the control of one of the 
three modes of material nature. When he is actually out of the body, then 
he. is out of the clutches of the material modes of nature. But as long as he 
is not out of the material body, he should be neutral. He should engage 
himself in the devotional service of the Lord so that his identity with the 
material body will automatically be forgotten. When one is conscious of 
the material body, he acts only for sense gratification, but when one 
transfers the consciousness to Kr�l).a, sense gratification automatically 
stops. One does not need this material body, and he does not need to 
accept the dictations of the material body. The qualities of the material 
modes in the body will act, but as spirit soul the self is aloof from such 
activities. How does he become aloof? He does not desire to enjoy the 
body, nor does he desire to get out of it. Thus transcendentally situated, 
the devotee becomes automatically free. He need not try to become free 
from the influence of the modes of material nature. 
The next question concerns the dealings of a transcendentally situated 
person. The materially situated person is affected by so-called honor and 
dishonor offered to the body, but the transcendentally situated person is 
not affected by such false honor and dishonor. He performs his duty in 
Krwa consciousness and does not mind whether a man honors or dishonors 
him. He accepts things that are favorable for his duty in Kr�l).a conscious­
ness, otherwise he has no necessity of anything material, either a stone or

gold. He takes everyone as his dear friend who helps him in his execution 
of Kr�r;ta consciousness, and he does not hate his so-called enemy. He is 
equally disposed and sees everything on an equal level because he knows 
perfectly well that he has nothing to do with material existence. Social 
and political issues do not affect him because he knows the situation of 
temporary upheavals and disturbances. He does not attempt anything for 
his own sake. He can attempt anything for Kr�r;ta, but for his personal 
self he does not attain anything. By such behavior one becomes actually 
transcendentally situated.

PURPORT 
This verse is a reply to Arjuna's third question: What is the means of 
attaining 
to 
the transcendental position?. As explained before, 
the 
material world is acting under the spell of the modes of material nature. 
One should not be disturbed by the activities of the modes of nature; 
-l 
Text 27] 
The Three Modes of Material Nature 
689 
instead of putting his consciousness into such activities, he may transfer 
his consciousness to Kn;va activities. Kr�va activities are known as bhakti­
yoga-always acting for Kr�va. This includes not only Kr�va, but His 
different plenary expansions such as Rama and Narayava. He has innumer­
able expansions. One who is engaged in the service of any of the forms of 
Kr�va, or of His plenary expansions, is considered to be transcendentally 
situated. One should also note that all the forms of Kr�va are fully 
transcendental, blissful, full of knowledge and eternal. Such personalities 
of Godhead are omnipotent and omniscient, and they possess all transcen­
dental qualities. So, if one engages himself in the service of Kr�1,.1a or His 
plenary expansions with unfailing determination, although these modes of 
material nature are very difficult to overcome, he can overcome them 
easily. 
This is already explained in the Seventh Chapter. One who 
surrenders unto Kr�va at once surmounts the influence of the modes of 
material nature. To be in Kr�va consciousness or in devotional service 
means to acquire the equality of Kr�va. The Lord says that His nature is 
eternal, blissful and full of knowledge, and the living entities are part and 
parcel of the Supreme, as gold particles are part of a gold mine. Thus the 
living entity's spiritual position is as good as gold, as good as Kr�va in 
quality. The difference of individuality continues, otherwise there is no 
question of bhakti-yoga. Bhakti-yoga means that the Lord is there, the 
devotee is there and the activity of exchange of love between the Lord and 
· 
· 
the devotee is there. Therefore the individuality of two persons is present 
in the Supreme Personality of Godhead and the individual person, other­
wise there is no meaning to bhakti-yoga. If one is not situated in the same 
transcendental position with the Lord, one cannot serve the Supreme 
Lord. To be a personal assistant to a king, one must acquire the qualifica­
tions. Thus the qualification is to become Brahman, or freed from all 
material contamination. It is said in the Vedic literature: brahmaiva san 
brahmiipyeti. One can attain the Supreme Brahman by becoming Brahman. 
This means that one must qualitatively become one with Brahman. By 
attainment of Brahman, one does not lose his eternal Brahman identity as 
individual soul.

. And I am the basis of the impersonal Brahman, which is the constitu­

and eternal. 
PURPORT 
The constitution of Brahman is immortality, imperishability, eternity, 
and happiness. Brahman is the beginning of transcendental realization. 
Paramatma, the Supersoul, is the middle, the second stage in transcenden­
tal realization, and the Supreme Personality of Godhead is the ultimate 
realization of the Absolute Truth. Therefore, both Paramatma and the 
impersonal Brahman are within the Supreme Person. It is explained in the 
Seventh Chapter that material nature is the manifestation of the inferior 
energy of the Supreme Lord. The Lord impregnates the inferior material 
nature with the fragments of the superior nature, and that is the spiritual 
touch in the material nature. When a living entity conditioned by this 
material nature begins the cultivation of spiritual knowledge, he elevates 
himself from the position of material existence and gradually rises up to 
the Brahman conception of the Supreme. This attainment of the Brahman 
conception of life is the first stage in self-realization. At this stage the 
Brahman realized person is transcendental to the material position, but he 
is not actually perfect in Brahman realization. If he wants, he can 
continue to stay in the Brahman position and then gradually rise up to 
Paramatmii realization and then to the realization of the Supreme Person­
ality of Godhead. There are many examples of this in Vedic literature. 
The four Kumaras were situated first in the impersonal Brahman concep­
tion of truth, but then they gradually rose to the platform of devotional 
Text 27] 
The Three Modes of Material Nature 
691 
service. One who cannot elevate himself beyond the impersonal concep­
tion of Brahman runs the risk of falling down. In Srimad-Bhiigavatam it is 
stated that 
although a person may rise to the stage of impersonal 
Brahman, without going farther, with no information of the Supreme 
Person, his intelligence is not perfectly clear. Therefore, in spite of being 
raised to the Brahman platform, there is the chance of falling down if 
one is not engaged in the devotional service of the Lord. In the Vedic 
language it is also said: raso vai safi,; rasam hy eviiyam labdhviinandi 
bhavati. "When one understands the Personality of God, the reservoir of 
pleasure, 
Kr�Q.a, 
he actually becomes transcendentally blissful." The 
Supreme Lord is full in six opulences, and when a devotee approaches 
Him, there is an exchange of these six opulences. The servant of the king 
enjoys on an almost equal level with the king. And so, eternal happiness, 
imperishable happiness, eternal life accompany devotional service. There­
fore, realization of Brahman, or eternity, or imperishability is included 
in devotional service. This is already possessed by a person who is 
engaged in devotional service. 
The living entity, although Brahman by nature, has the desire to lord 
it over the material world, and due to this he falls down. In his con­
stitutional position, a living entity is above the three modes of material 
nature, but association with material nature entangles him in the different 
modes of material nature, goodness, passion and ignorance. Due to the 
association of these three modes, his desire to dominate the material 
world is there. By engagement in devotional service in full Kr�Q.a con­
sciousness, he is immediately situated in the transcendental position, and 
his unlawful desire to control material nature is removed. Therefore the 
process of devotional service beginning with hearing, chanting, remember­
ing-the prescribed nine methods for realizing devotional service-should 
be practiced in the association of devotees. Gradually, by such association, 
by the influence of the spiritual master, one's material desire to dominate 
is removed, and one becomes firmly situated in the Lord's transcendental 
loving service. This method is prescribed from the twenty-second to the 
last verse of this chapter. Devotional service to the Lord is very simple: one 
should always engage in the service of the Lord, should eat the remnants 
of foodstuffs offered to the Deity, smell the flowers offered to the 
lotus feet of the Lord, see the places where the Lord had His transcendental 
pastimes, read of the different activities of the Lord, His reciprocation 
of love with His devotees, chant always the transcendental vibration Hare 
Kr�Q.a, Hare Kr�Q.a, Kr�Q.a Kr�Q.a, Hare Hare/ Hare Rama, Hare Rama,

"' appearances and disappearances of the Lord a:nd His devotees. By follow­
ing such a process one becomes completely detached from all material

fo .the Supreme Personality of Godhead in quality.

[Ch. 15 
TRANSLATION 
The Blessed Lord said: There is a banyan tree which has its roots 
upward and its branches down and whose leaves are the Vedic hymns. 
One who knows this tree is the knower of the Vedas. 
PURPORT 
After the discussion of the importance of bhakti-yoga, one may 
question, "What about the Vedas?" It is explained in this chapter that the 
purpose of Vedic study is to understand Krwa. Therefore one who is in 
Kn;Q.a consciousness, who is engaged in devotional service, already knows 
the Vedas. 
The entanglement of this material world is compared here to a banyan 
tree. For one who is engaged in fruitive activities, there is no end to the 
banyan tree. He wanders from one branch to another, to another, to 
another. The tree of this material world has no end, and for one who is 
attached to this tree, there is no possibility of liberation. The Vedic 
hymns, meant for elevating oneself, are called the leaves of this tree. 
This tree's roots grow upward because they begin from where Brahma is 
located, the topmost planet of this universe. If one can understand this 
indestructible tree of illusion, then one can get out of it. 
This process of extrication should be understood. In the previous 
chapters it has been explained that there are many processes by which to 
get out of the material entanglement. And, up to the Thirteenth Chapter, 
we have seen that devotional service to the Supreme Lord is the best way. 
Now, the basic principle of devotional service is detachment from materi�l 
activities and attachment to the transcendental service of the Lord. The 
process of breaking attachment to the material world is discussed in the 
beginning of this chapter. The root of this material existence grows 
upward. This means that it begins from the total material substance, 
from the topmost planet of the universe. From there, the whole universe 
is expanded, with so many branches, representing the various planetary 
systems. The fruits represent the results of the living entities' activities, 
namely, religion, economic development, sense gratification and liberation. 
Now, there is no ready experience in this world of a tree situated 
with its branches down and its roots upward, but there is such a thing. 
That tree can be found beside a reservoir of water. We can see that the 
trees on the bank reflect upon the water with their branches down and 
Text 2] 
The Yoga of the Supreme Person 
695 
roots up. In other words, the tree of this material world is only a 
reflection of the real tree of the spiritual world. This reflection of the 
spiritual world is situated on desire, just as the tree's reflection is 
situated on water. Desire is the cause of things' being situated in this 
reflected material light. One who wants to get out of this material 
existence must know this tree thoroughly through analytical study. Then 
he can cut off his relationship with it. 
This tree, being the reflection of the real tree, is an exact replica. 
Everything is there in the spiritual world. The impersonalists take Brahma 
to be the root of this material tree, and from the root, according to 
siinkhya philosophy, come prakrt� puru§a, then the three gup,as, then 
the five gross elements (panca-mahiibhuta), then the ten senses ( dasendriya), 
mind, etc. In this way they divide up the whole material world. If 
Brahma is the center of all manifestations, then this material world is a 
manifestation of the center by 180 degrees, and the other 180 degrees 
constitute the spiritual world. 
The material world is the perverted 
reflection, so the spiritual world must have the same variegatedness, but 
in reality. The prakrti is the external energy of the Supreme Lord, and 
the puru§a is the Supreme Lord Himself, and that is explained in 
Bhagavad-gitii. Since this manifestation is material, it is temporary. A 
reflection is temporary, for it is sometimes seen and sometimes not seen. 
But the origin from whence the reflection is reflected is eternal. The 
material reflection of the real tree has to be cut off. When it is said that 
a person knows the Vedas, it is assumed that he knows how to cut off 
attachment to this material world. If one knows that process, he 
actually knows the 
Vedas. 
One who is attracted by the ritualistic 
formulas of the Vedas is attracted by the beautiful green leaves of the 
tree. He does not exactly know the purpose of the Vedas. The purpose 
of the Vedas, as disclosed by the Personality of Godhead Himself, is to 
cut down this reflected tree and attain the real tree of the spiritual world.

TRANSLATION 
The branches of this tree extend downward and upward, nourished 
by the three modes of material nature. The twigs are the objects of the 
senses. This tree also has roots going down, and these are bound to the 
fruitive actions of human society. 
PURPORT 
The description of the banyan tree is further explained here. Its 
branches are spread in all directions. In the lower parts, there are 
variegated manifestations of living entities, such as human beings, animals, 
horses, cows, dogs, cats, etc. These are situated on the lower parts of the 
branches, whereas on the upper parts are higher forms of living entities: 
the demigods, Gandharvas (fairies), and many other higher species of life. 
As a tree is nourished by water, so this tree is nourished by the three modes 
of material nature. Sometimes we find that a tract of land is barren for 
want of sufficient water, and sometimes a tract is very green; similarly, 
where the modes of material nature are proportionately greater in 
quantity, the diffe!ent species of life are manifested in that proportion. 
The twigs of 'the tree are considered to be the sense objects. By 
development of the different modes of nature, we develop different 
senses, and, by the senses, we enjoy different varieties of sense objects. 
The source of the senses-the ears, the nose, eyes, etc.-is considered 
to be the upper twigs, tuned to the enjoyment of -different sense 
objects. The leaves are sound, form, touch-the sense objects. The roots, 
which are· subsidiary, are the by-products of different varieties of suffering 
and sense enjoyment. Thus we develop attachment and aversion. The 
tendencies toward piety and impiety are considered to be the secondary

roots, spreading in all directions. The real root is from Brahmaloka, and 
the other roots are in the human planetary systems. After one enjoys the 
results of virtuous activities in the upper planetary systems, he comes down 
to this earth and renews his karma or fruitive activities for promotion. This 
planet of human beings is considered the field of activities.

Bhagavad-gita As It Is 
[Ch. 15 
TRANSLATION 
The real form of this tree cannot be perceived in this world. No one can 
understand where it ends, where it begins, or where its foundation is. 
But with determination one must cut down this tree with the weapon of 
detachment. So doing, one must seek that place from which, having once 
gone, one never returns, and there surrender to that Supreme Personality 
of Godhead from whom everything has begun and in whom everything 
is abiding since time immemorial. 
PURPORT 
It is now clearly stated that the real form of this banyan tree cannot 
be understood in this material world. Since the root is upwards, the 
extension of the real tree is at the other end. No one can see how far 
the tree extends, nor can one see the beginning of this tree. Yet one has 
to find out the cause. "I am the son of my father, my father is the son 
of such and such a person, etc." By searching in this way, one comes to 
Brahma, who is generated by the Garbhodakasayi Vi�J).u. Finally, in this 
·way, when one reaches to the Supreme Personality of Godhead, that is 
the end of research work. One has to search out that origin of this tree, 
the Supreme Personality of Godhead, through the association of persons 
who are in the knowledge of that Supreme Personality of Godhead. Then 
by understanding one becomes gradually detached from this false reflection 
of reality, and by knowledge one can cut off the connection and actually 
become situated in the real tree. 
The word asanga is very important in this connection because the 
attachment for sense enjoyment and lording it over ,the material nature is 
very strong. Therefore one must learn detachment by discussion of 
spiritual science based on authoritative scriptures, and one must hear 
from persons who are actually in knowledge. As a result of such discussion 
in the association of devotees, one comes to the Supreme Personality of 
Godhead. Then the first thing one must do is surrender to Him. The 
description of that place whence going no one returns to this false 
reflected tree is given here. The Supreme Personality of Godhead, Kr�J).a, 
is the original root from whom everything has emanated. To gain favor of 
that Personality of Godhead, one has only to surrender, and this is a result 
of performing devotional service by hearing, chanting, etc. He is the cause 
of this extension of this mateFial world. This is already explained by the 
Lord Himself: aham sarvasya prabhava�. "I am the origin of everything."

One who is free from illusion, false prestige, and false association, who 
understands the eternal, who is done with material lust and is freed from 
the duality of happiness and distress, and who knows how to surrender 
unto the Supreme Person, attains to that eternal kingdom. 
PURPORT 
The surrendering process is described here very nicely. The first qualifi­
cation is that one should not be deluded by pride. Because· the conditioned 
soul is puffed up, thinking himself the lord of material nature, it is very 
difficult for him to surrender unto the Supreme Personality of Godhead. 
One should know by the cultivation of real knowledge that he is not lord 
of material nature; the Supreme Personality of Godhead is the Lord. When 
one is free from delusion caused by pride, he can begin the process of 
l �

[Ch. 15 . 
surrender. For one who is always ext>ecting some honor in this material 
world, it is not possible to surrender to the Supreme Person. Pride is due 
to illusion, for although one comes here, stays for a brief time and then 
goes away, he has the foolish notion that he is the lord of the world. He 
thus makes all things complicated, and he is always in trouble. The whole 
world moves under this impression. People are considering that the land, 
this earth, belongs to human society, and they have divided the land under 
the false impression that they are the proprietors. One has to get out of 
this false notion that human society is the proprietor of this world. When 
one is freed from such a false notion, he becomes free from all the false 
associations caused by familial, social, and national affections. These fake 
associations bind one to this material world. After this stage, one has to 
develop spiritual knowledge. One has to cultivate knowledge of what is 
actually his own and what is actually not his own. And, when one has an 
understanding of things as they are, he becomes free from all dual concep­
tions such as happiness and distress, pleasure and pain. He becomes full in 
knowledge; then it is possible for him to surrender to the Supreme Person­
ality of Godhead.

PURPORT 
The spiritual world, the abode of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, 
Kr�I).a-which is known as Kr�I).aloka, Goloka Vrndavana-is described 
here. In the spiritual sky there is no need of sunshine, moonshine, fire or 
electricity, because all the planets are self-luminous. We have only one 
planet in this universe, the sun, which is self-luminous, but all the planets 
in the spiritual sky are self-luminous. The shining effulgence of all those 
planets (called Vaikul).thas) constitutes the shining sky known as the 
brahmajyoti. Actually, the effulgence is emanating from the planet of 
Kr�I).a, Goloka V rndavana. Part of that shining effulgence is covered by 
the mahat-tattva, the material world. Other than this, the major portion of 
that shining sky is full of spiritual planets, which are called V aikul).thas, 
chief of which is Goloka V rndavana. 
As long as a living entity is in this dark material world, he is in condi­
tional life, but as soon as he reaches the spiritual sky, by cutting through 
the false, perverted tree of this material world, he becomes liberated. Then 
there is no chance of his coming back here. In his conditional life, the living 
entity considers himself to be the lord of this material world, but in his 
liberated state he enters into the spiritual kingdom and becomes the 
associate of the Supreme Lord. There he enjoys eternal bliss, eternal life, 
and full knowledge. 
One should be captivated by this information. He should desire to 
transfer himself to that eternal world and extricate himself from this false 
reflection of reality. For one who is too much attached to this material 
world, it is very difficult to cut that attachment, but if he takes to Kr�I).a 
consciousness, there is a chance of gradually becoming detached. One has 
to associate himself with devotees, those who are in Kr�I).a consciousness. 
One should search out a society dedicated to Kr�I).a consciousness and 
learn how to discharge devotional service. In this way he can cut off his 
attachment to the material world. One cannot become detached from the 
attraction of the material world simply by dressing himself in saffron 
cloth. He must become attached to the devotional service of the Lord. 
Therefore one should take it very seriously that devotional service as de­
scribed in the Twelfth Chapter is the only way to get out of this false repre­
sentation of the real tree. In Chapter Fourteen the contamination of all 
kinds of processes by material nature is described. Only devotional service 
is described as purely transcendental. 
The words paramam mama are very important here. Actually every nook

and corner is the property of the Supreme Lord, but the spiritual world is 
paramam, full of six opulences. In the Upani§ads it is also confirmed that 
in the spiritual world there is no need of sunshine or moonshine, for the 
whole spiritual sky is illuminated by the internal potency of the .Supreme 
Lord. That supreme abode can be achieved only by surrender and by no 
other means.

TRANSLATION 
The living entities in this conditioned world are My eternal, fragmental 
parts. Due to conditioned life, they are struggling very hard with the six 
senses, which include the mind. 
PURPORT 
In this verse the identity of the living being is clearly given. The living 
entity is the fragmental part and parcel of the Supreme Lord-eternally. It 
is not that he assumes individuality in his conditional life and in his 
liberated state becomes one with the Supreme Lord. He is eternally frag­
mented. It is clearly said, saniitana�. According to the Vedic version, the 
Supreme Lord manifests and expands Himself in innumerable expans!ons, 
of which the primary expansions are called Vi§rtU-tattva, and the secondary 
expansions are called the living entities. In other words, the Vi§pu-tattva 
is the personal expansion,_ and the living entities are separated expansions. 
By His personal expansion, He is manifested in various forms like Lord 
Rama, Nrsimhadeva, Vi�Q.umurti and all the predominating Deities in the 
Text 7] 
The Yoga of the Supreme Person 
703 
V aikut;tha planets. The separated expansions, the living entities, are eter­
nally servitors. The personal expansions of the Supreme Personality of 
Godhead, the individual identities of the Godhead, are always present. 
Similarly, the separated expansions of living entities have their identities. 
As fragmental parts and parcels of the Supreme Lord, the living entities 
have also fragmental qualities, of which independence is one. Every living 
entity has an individual soul, his personal individuality and a minute form 
of independence. By misuse of that independence, one becomes a condi­
tioned soul, and by proper use of independence he is always liberated. In 
either case, he is qualititatively eternal, as the Supreme Lord is. In his 
liber!lted state he is freed from this material condition, and he is under the 
engagement of transcendental service unto the Lord; in his conditioned 
life he is dominated by the material modes of nature, and he forgets the 
transcendental loving service of the Lord. As a result, he has to struggle 
very hard to maintain his existence in the material world. 
The living entities, not only the human beings and the cats and dogs, 
but even the greater controllers of the material world-Brahm a, Lord Siva, 
and even Vi�t;u-are all parts and parcels of the Supreme Lord. They are 
all eternal, not temporary manifestations. The word kar§ati (struggling or 
grappling hard) is very significant. The conditioned soul is bound up, as 
though shackled by iron chains. He is bound up by the false ego, and the 
mind is the chief agent which is driving him in this material existence. 
When the mind is in the mode of goodness, his activities are good; when the 
mind is in the mode of passion, his activities are troublesome; and when 
the mind is in the mode of ignorance, he travels in the lower species of life. 
It is clear, however, in this verse, that the conditioned soul is covered by 
the material body, with the mind and the senses, and when he is liberated 
this material covering perishes, but his spiritual body manifests in its indi­
vidual capacity. The following information is there in the Miidhyandi­
niiyana-sruti: sa vii e§a b rahma-ni§tha idam sarirarh marttyam atisrjya 
brahmiibhisampadya brahmar-ii pasyati brahmar-ii srr-oti brahmar-aivedarh 
sarvam anubhavati. It is stated here that when a living entity gives up this 
material embodiment and enters into the spiritual world, he revives his 
spiritual body, and in his spiritual body he can see the Supreme Personality 
of Godhead face to face. He can hear and speak to Him face to face, and 
he can understand the Supreme Personality as He is. In smrti also it is 
understood that in the spiritual planets everyone lives in bodies featured 
like the Supreme Personality of Godhead's. As far as bodily construction 
is concerned, there is no difference between the part and parcel living 
entities and the expansions of Vi§r-umiirti. In other words, at liberation 
1

704 
Bhagavad-glta As It Is 
[Ch. 15 
the living entity gets a spiritual body by the grace of the Supreme Person­
ality ofGodhead. 
The word mamaiviiritsa� (fragmental parts and parcels of the Supreme 
Lord) is also very significant. The fragmental portion of the Supreme Lord 
is not like some material broken part. We have already understood in the 
Second Chapter that the spirit cannot be cut into pieces. This fragment is 
not materially conceived. It is not like matter which can be cut into pieces 
and joined together again. That conception is not applicable here because 
the Sanskrit word saniitana (eternal) is used. The fragmental portion is 
eternal. It is also stated in the beginning of the Second Chapter that (dehino 
'smin yathii) in each and every individual body, the fragmental portion of 
the Supreme Lord is present. That fragmental portion, when liberated 
from the bodily entanglement, revives its original spiritual body in the 
spiritual sky in a spiritual planet and enjoys association with the Supreme 
Lord. It is, however, understood here that the living entity, being the 
fragmental part and parcel of the Supreme Lord, is qualitatively one, just 
as the parts and parcels of gold are also gold.

PURPORT 
Here the living entity is described as isvara, the controller of his own 
body. If he likes, he can change his body to a higher grade, and if he likes 
he can move to a lower class. Minute independence is there. The change 
his body undergoes depends upon him. At the time of death, the con­
sciousness he has created will carry him on to the next type of body. If he 
has made his consciousness like that of a cat or dog, he is sure to change 
to a eat's or dog's body. And, if he has fixed his consciousness on godly 
qualities, he will change into the form of a demigod. And, if he is in Kn;J).a 
consciousness, he will be transferred to Kr�J).aloka in the spiritual world 
and will associate with Kr�J).a. It is a false claim that after the annihilation 
.j 
of this body everything is finished. The individual soul is transmigrating 
from one body to another, and his present body and present activities are 
j 
the background of his next body. One gets a different body according to 
karma, and he has to quit this body in due course. It is stated here that 
the subtle body, which carries the conception of the next body, develops 
another body in the next life. This process of transmigrating from one body 
to another and struggling while in the body is called kar§ati or struggle for 
existence.

TRANSLATION 
The living entity, thus taking another gross body, obtains a certain 
type of ear, tongue, and nose and sense of touch, which are grouped 
about the mind. He thus enjoys a particular set of sense objects. 
PURPORT 
In other words, if the living entity adulterates his consciousness with the 
qualities of cats and dogs, in his next life he gets a cat or dog body and 
enjoys. Consciousness is originally pure, like water. But if we mix water 
with a certain color, it changes. Similarly, consciousness is pure, for the 
spirit soul is pure. But consciousness is changed according to the associa­
tion of the material qualities. Real consciousness is Kr�tta consciousness. 
When, therefore, one is situated in Kr�tta consciousness, he is in his pure 
life. But if his consciousness is adulterated by some type of material men­
tality, in the next life he gets a corresponding body. He does not necessari­
ly get a human body again; he can get the body of a cat, dog, hog, demi­
god or one of many other forms, for there ,are 8,400,000 species.

the modes of nature. But one whose eyes are trained in knowledge can 
see all this. 
PURPORT 
The word jiiiina-cak�u�a[l is very significant. Without knowledge, one 
cannot understand how a living entity leaves his present body, nor what 
form of body he is going to take in the next life, nor even why he is living 
in a particular type of body. This requires a great amount of knowledge 
understood from Bhagavad-gitii and similar literatures heard from a bona 
fide spiritual master. One who is trained to perceive all these things is 
fortunate. Every living entity is quitting his body under certain circum­
stances; he is living under certain circumstances and enjoying under certain 
circumstances under the spell of material nature. As a result, he is suffering 
different kinds of happiness and distress, under the illusion of sense enjoy­
ment. Persons who are everlastingly fooled by lust and desire lose all power 
of understanding their change of body and their stay in a particular body. 
They cannot comprehend it. Those who have developed spiritual know­
ledge, however, can see that the spirit is different from the body and is 
changing its body and enjoying in different ways. A person in such know­
ledge can understand how the conditioned living entity is suffering in this 
material existence. Therefore those who are highly developed in Kn>Q.a 
consciousness try their best to give this knowledge to the people in general, 
for their conditional life is very much troublesome. They should come out 
of it and be Kr�Q.a conscious and liberate themselves to transfer to the 
spiritual world.

TRANSLATION 
The endeavoring transcendentalist, who is situated in self-realization, 
can see all this clearly. But those who are not situated in self-realization 
cannot see what is taking place, though they may try to. 
PURPORT 
There are many transcendentalists in the path of spiritual self-realization, 
but one who is not situated in self-realization cannot see how things are 
changing in the body of the living entity. The word yogina� is significant 
in this connection. In the present day there are many so-called yogis, and 
there are many so-called associations of yogis, but they are actually blind 
in the matter of self-realization. They are simply addicted to some sort of 
gymnastic exercise and are satisfied if the body is well-built and healthy. 
They have no other information. They are called yatanto'py akrtiitmiina�. 
Even though they are endeavoring in a so-called yoga system, they are not 
self-realized. Such people cannot understand the process of the transmi­
gration of the soul. Only those who are actually in the yoga system and 
have realized the self, the world, and the Supreme Lord, in other words, 
the bhakti-yogis, those engaged in pure devotional service in Kr��a cone 
sciousness, can understand how things are taking place.

TRANSLATION 
The splendor of the sun, which dissipates the darkness of this whole 
world, comes from Me. And the splendor of the moon and the splendor 
of fire are also from Me. 
PURPORT 
The unintelligent cannot understand how things are taking place. The 
beginning of knowledge can be established by understanding what the 
Lord explains here. Everyone sees th� sun, moon, fire and electricity. 
One should simply try to understand that the splendor of the sun, the 
splendor of the moon, and the splendor of electricity or fire are coming 
from the Supreme Personality of Godhead. In such a conception of life, 
the beginning of Kr�r;ta consciousness, lies a great deal of advancement for 
the conditioned soul in this material world. The living entities are 
essentially the parts and parcels of the Supreme Lord, and He is giving 
herewith the hint how they can come back to Godhead, back to home. 
From this verse we can understand that the sun is illuminating the whole 
solar system. There are different universes and solar systems, and there 
are different suns, moons and planets also. Sunlight is due to the spiritual 
effulgence in the spiritual sky of the Supreme Lord. With the rise of the 
sun, the activities of human beings are set up. They set fire to prepare 
their foodstuff; they set fire to start the factories, etc. So many things 
are done with the help of fire. Therefore sunrise, fire and moonlight are 
so pleasing to the living entities. Without their help no living entity can 
live. So if one can understand that the light and splendor of the sun, moon 
and fire are emanating from the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Kr�r;ta, 
then one's Kr�r;ta consciousness will begin. By the moonshine, all the 
vegetables are nourished. The moonshine is so pleasing that people can 
easily understand that they are living by the mercy of the Supreme 
Personality of Godhead Kr�r;ta. Without His mercy there cannot be sun, 
without His mercy there cannot be moon, and without His mercy there 
cannot be fire, and without the help of sun, moon and fire, no one can 
live. These are some thoughts to provoke Kr�r;ta consciousness in the 
conditioned soul.

I enter into each planet, and by My energy they stay in orbit. I become

PURPORT 
It is understood that all the planets are floating in the air only by the 
energy of the Lord. The Lord enters into every atom, every planet, and 
every living being. That is discussed in the Brahma-samhita. It is said 
there that one plenary portion of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, 
Paramatma, enters into the planets, the universe, the living entity, and 
even into the atom. So due to His entrance, everything is appropriately 
manifested. When the spirit soul is there, a living man can float on the 
water, but when the living spark is out of the body and the body is dead, 
it sinks. Of course when it is decomposed it floats just like straw and 
other things, hut as soon as the man is dead, he at once sinks in the water. 
Similarly, all these planets are floating in space, and this is due to the 
entrance of the supreme energy of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. 
His energy is sustaining each planet, just like a handful of dust. If someone 
holds a handful of dust, there is no possibility of the dust falling, but if 
one throws it in the air, it will fall down. Similarly, these planets, which 
are floating in air, are actually held in the fist of the universal form of the 
. Supreme Lord. By His strength and energy, all moving and unmoving 
things stay in their place. It is said that because of the Supreme Personality 
'-
. Text 14] 
The Yoga of the Supreme Person 
711 
of Godhead, the sun is shining and the planets are steadily moving. Were 
it not for Him, all the planets would scatter, like dust in air, and perish. 
Similarly, it is due to the Supreme Personality of Godhead that the moon 
nourishes all vegetables. Due to the moon's influence, the vegetables 
become delicious. Without the moonshine, the vegetables can neither 
grow nor taste succulent. Human society is working, living comfortably 
and enjoying food due to the supply from the Supreme Lord. Otherwise, 
mankind could not survive. The word rasiitmaka� is very significant. 
Everything becomes palatable by the agency of the Supreme Lord through 
the influence of the moon.

According to Ayur-vedic siistra, we understand that there is a fire in 
the stomach which digests all food sent there. When the fire is not 
blazing, there is no hunger, and when the fire is in order, we become 
hungry. 
Sometimes when the fire is not going nicely, treatment is 
required. In any case, this fire is representative of the Supreme Personality 
of Godhead. Vedic mantras also confirm that the Supreme Lord or 
' .1

712 
Bhagavad-gita As It Is 
[Ch. 15 
Brahman is situated in the form of fire within the stomach and is digesting 
all kinds of foodstuff. Therefore since He is helping the digestion of all 
kinds of foodstuff, the living entity is not independent in the eating 
process. Unless the Supreme Lord helps him in digesting, there is no 
possibility of eating. He thus produces and digests foodstuff, and, by His 
grace, we are enjoying life. In the Vediinta-siitra this is also confirmed: 
sabdiidibhyo'nta[l, prat4thiiniic ca. The Lord is situated within sound 
and within the body, within the air and even within the stomach as the 
digestive force. There are four kinds of foodstuff: some are swallowed, 
some are chewed, some are licked up, and some are sucked, and He is 
the digestive force for all of them.

The Supreme Lord is situated as Paramatma in everyone's heart, and it 
is from Him that all activities are initiated. The living entity forgets 
- I
Text 15) 
The Yoga of the Supreme Person 
713 
everything of his past life, but he has to act according to the direction of 
the Supreme Lord, who is witness to all his work. Therefore he begins his 
work according to his past deeds. Required knowledge is supplied to him, 
and remembrance is given to him, and he forgets, also, about his past life. 
Thus, the Lord is not only all-pervading; He is also localized in every 
individual heart. He awards the different fruitive results. He is not only 
worshipable as the impersonal Brahman, the Supreme Personality of 
Godhead, and the localized Paramatma, but as the form of the incarnation 
of the Vedas as well. The Vedas give the right direction to the people so 
that they can properly mold their lives and come back to Godhead, back 
to home. The Vedas offer knowledge of the Supreme Personality of 
Godhead, Kn;l).a, and Kr�l).a in His incarnation as V yasadeva is the compiler 
of 
the Vediinta-siitra. 
The commentation on the Vediinta-siitra by 
Vyasadeva in the Srimad-Bhiigavatam gives the real understanding of 
Vediinta-siitra. The Supreme Lord is so full that for the deliverance of 
the conditioned soul He is the supplier and digester of foodstuff, the 
witness of his activity, the giver of knowledge in the form of Vedas and 
as the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Sri Kr�l).a, the teacher of the 
Bhagavad-gitii. He is worshipable by the conditioned soul. Thus God is 
aU-good; God is all-merciful. 
Anta�prav�ta� siistii janiiniim. The living entity forgets as soon as he

renew his work where he ended his last life. So not only does a living entity 
enjoy or suffer in this world according to the dictation from the Supreme 
Lord situated locally in the heart, but he receives the opportunity to 
understand Vedas from Him. If one is serious to understand the Vedic 
knowledge� then Kr�l).a gives the required intelligence. Why does He present 
the Vedic knowledge for understanding? Because a living entity individually 
needs to understand Kr�l).a. Vedic literature confirms this: yo'sau sarvair 
vedair giyate. In all Vedic literature, beginning from the four Vedas, 
Vediinta-siitra and the Upani�ads and Puriicws, the glories of the Supreme 
Lord are celebrated. By performing Vedic rituals, discussing the Vedic 
philosophy and worshiping the Lord in devotional service, He is attained. 
Therefore the purpose of the Vedas is to understand' Kr�l).a. The Vedas give 
us direction to understand Kr�l).a and the process of understanding. The 
ultimate goal is the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Vediinta-siitra con­
firms this in the following words: tat tu samanvayiit. One can attain perfec­
tion by understanding Vedic literature, and one can understand his rela­
tionship with the Supreme Personality of Godhead by performing the 
different processes. Thus one can approach Him and at the end attain the

supreme goal, who is no other than the Supreme Personality of Godhead.

Vedas and the goal of Vedas are clearly defined.

There are two classes of beings, the fallible and the infallible. In the 
material world every entity is fallible, and in the spiritual world every 
entity is called infallible. 
PURPORT 
As already explained, the Lord in His incarnation as Vyasadeva compiled 
the Vediinta-siitra. Here the Lord is giving, in summary, the contents of the 
Vediinta-siitra: He says that the living entities, who are innumerable, can 
be divided into two classes-the fallible and the infallible. The living enti­
ties are eternally separated parts and parcels of the Supreme Personality 
of Godhead. When they are in contact with the material world, they are 
called jiva-bhiitii�, and the Sanskrit words given here, sarviipi bhiitiini, 
mean that they are fallible. Those who are in oneness with the Supreme 
Personality of Godhead, however, are called infallible.- Oneness does not 
mean that they have no individuality, but that there is no disunity. They 
are all agreeable to the purpose of the creation. Of course, in the spiritual 
world, there is no such thing as creation, but since the Supreme Personality

of Godhead has stated in the Vediinta-siitra that He is the source of all 
emanations, that conception is explained. 
According to the statement of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, 
Lord Kr�l)a, there are two classes of men. The Vedas give evidence of this, 
so there is no doubt about it. The living entities, who are struggling in this 
world with the mind and five senses, have their material bodies which are 
changing as long as the living entities are conditioned. One's body changes 
due to contact with matter; matter is changing, so the living entity appears 
to be changing. But in the spiritual world the body is not made of matter; 
therefore there is no change. In the material world the living entity under­
goes six changes-birth, growth, duration, reproduction, then dwindling 
and vanishing. These are the changes of the material body. But in the 
spiritual world the body does not change; there is no old age, there is no 
birth, there is no death. There all exists in oneness. It is more clearly 
explained as saroiip.i bhiitiini: any living entity who has come in contact 
with matter, beginning from the first created being, Brahma, down to a 
small ant, is changing its body; therefore they are all fallible. In the 
spiritual world, however, they are always liberated in oneness.

Bhagavad-gita As It Is 
[Ch. 15 
PURPORT 
This verse is very nicely expressed in the Katha Upan�ad and Svetiisva­
tara Upani�ad: It is clearly stated there that above the innumerable living 
entities, some of whom are conditioned and some of whom are liberated, 
there is the Supreme Personality who is Paramatma. The U panisadic 
verse runs as follows: nityo nityiiniirh cetanas cetaniiniim. The purport is 
that amongst all the living entities, both conditioned and liberated, there 
is one supreme living personality, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, 
. who maintains them and gives them all the facility of enjoyment according 
to different work. That Supreme Personality of Godhead is situated in 
everyone's heart as Paramatma. A wise man who can understand Him is 
eligible to attain the perfect peace, not others. 
It is incorrect to think. of the Supreme Lord and the living entities as 
being· on the same level or equal in all respects. There is always the ques­
tion of superiority and inferiority in their personalities. This particular 
word uttdma is very significant. No one can surpass the Supreme Person­
ality of Godhead. Loke is also significant because in the Paum�a, a Vedic 
literature, it-is stated: lokyate vediirtho'nena. This Supreme Lord in His 
· localized aspect as Paramatma explains the purpose of the Vedas. The 
'following verse also appears in the Vedas: 
tiivad e�a samprasiido 'smiic 
chaririit samutthiiya pararh 
jyoti-riiparh sampadya svena 
riiper-iibhin�padyate sa uttama� pum�a� 
''The Supersoul coming out of the body enters the impersonal brahma-
. jypti; then in"'His form He.remains in His spiritual identity. That Supreme 
· .is called the Supreme Personality." 
This means that the Supreme 
Personality is exhibiting and diffusing His spiritual effulgence, which is 
. the 'ultimate illumination. That Supreme Personality also has a localized 
.aspect a,s Paramatma. By incarnating Himself as the son of Satyavafi and 
Parasara, He explains th� Vedic knowledge as V yasadeva.

cannot surpass in quantity the inconceivable pote.ncies of· the Suprem·e

Whoever knows Me as the Supreme Personality of Godhead, without

' 
PURPORT 
There are many philosophical speculations about the constitutional 
position of the living entities and the Supreme Absolute Truth. Now in 
this verse the Supreme Personality of Godhead clearly explains that any­
one who knows Lord Kr�J.:la as the Supreme Person is actually the 
knower of everything. The imperfect knower goes on simply speculating 
about the Absolute Truth, but the perfect knower, without wasting his 
valuable time, engages directly in Kr�J.:la consciousness, the devotional 
service of the Supreme Lord. Throughout the whole of Bhagavad-gita, 
this fact is being stressed at every step. And still there are so many 
stubborn commentators on Bhagavad-gita who consider the Supreme 
Absolute Truth and the living entities to be one and the same. 
Vedic knowledge is called sruti, learning by aural reception. One should 
actually receive the Vedic message from authorities like Kr�J.:la and His 
representatives. Here Kr�J.:la distinguishes everything very nicely, and one 
should hear from this source. Simply to hear like the hogs is not sufficient; 
one must be able to understand from the authorities. It is not that one 
should simply speculate academically. One should submissively hear from 
Bhagavad-gita that these living entities are always subordinate to the 
Supreme Personality of Godhead. Anyone who is able to understand this, 
according to the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Sri Kr�J.:la, knows the 
purpose of the Vedas; no one else knows the purpose of the Vedas. 
The word bhajate is very significant. In many places the word bhajate is 
expressed in relationship with the service of the Supreme Lord. If a 
person is engaged in full Kr�J.:la consciousness in devotional service of the 
Lord, it is to be understood that he has understood all the Vedic knowledge. 
In the V ai�l)ava parampara it is said that if one is engaged in the devotion­
al service of Kr�J.:la, then there is no need for a spiritual process to under­
stand the Supreme Absolute Truth. He has illready come to the post

because he is engaged in the devotional service of the Lord. He has ended 
all preliminary processes of understanding; similarly, if anyone, after 
speculating for hundreds of thousands of lives, does not come to the 
point that Krgta is the Supreme Personality of Godhead and that one 
has to surrender there, all his speculation for so many years and lives is a 
useless waste of time.

TRANSLATION 
This is the most confidential part of the Vedic scriptures, 0 sinless one, 
and it is disclosed now by Me. Whoever understands this will become wise, 
and his endeavors will know perfection. 
PURPORT 
The Lord clearly explains here that this is the substance of all revealed 
scriptures. And one should understand this as it is given by the Supreme 
Personality of Godhead. Thus one will become intelligent and perfect in 
transcendental knowledge. In other words, by understanding this philoso­
phy of the Supreme Personality of Godhead and engaging in His transcen­
dental service, everyone can become freed from all contaminations of the 
modes of material nature. Devotional service is a process of spiritual 
understanding. Wherever devotional service exists, the material contami­
nation cannot coexist. Devotional service to the Lord and the Lord Himself 
720 
Bhagavad-glta As It Is 
[Ch. 15. 
are one and the same because they are spiritual-the internal energy of the 
Supreme Lord. The Lord is said to be the sun, and ignorance is called 
darkness. Where the sun is present, there is no question of darkness. 
Therefore, whenever devotional service is present under the proper guidance 
of a bona fide spiritual master, there is no question of ignorance. 
Everyone must take to this consciousness of Kr�Q.a and engage in 
devotional service to become intelligent and purified. Unless one comes to 
this position of understanding Kr�Q.a and engages in devotional service, 
however intelligent he may be in the estimation of some common man, 
he is not perfectly intelligent. 
The word anagha, by which Arjuna is addressed, is significant. Anagha, 
0 sinless one, means that unless one is free from all sinful reactions, it is 
very difficult to understand Kr�Q.a. One has to become free from all 
contamination, all sinful activities; then he can understand. But devotional 
service is so pure and potent that once one is engaged in devotional service 
he automatically comes to the stage of sinlessness. 
While performing devotional service in the association of pure devotees 
in full Kr�Q.a consciousness, there are certain things which require to be 
vanquished altogether. The most important thing one has to surmount is 
weakness of the heart. The first falldown is caused by the desire to lord it 
over material nature. Thus one gives up the transcendental loving service 
of the Supreme Lord. The second weakness of the heart is that as one 
increases the propensity of lording it over material nature, he becomes 
attached to matter and the possession of matter. The problems of material 
existence are due to these weaknesses of the heart. 
Thus end the Bhaktivedanta Purports to the Fifteenth Chapter of the 
Srimad-Bhagavad-gita in the matter of Puru�ottama-yoga, the Yoga of the 
Supreme Person.

The Blessed Lord said: Fearlessness, purification of one's existence, 
cultivation of spiritual knowledge, charity, self-control, performance of 
sacrifice, study of the Vedas, austerity and simplicity; nonviolence, truth­
fulness, freedom from anger; renunciation, tranquility, aversion to fault­
finding, compassion and freedom from covetousn�s; gentleness, modesty 
and steady determination; vigor, forgiveness, fortitude, cleanliness, free­
dom from envy and the passion for honor-these transcendental quali­
ties, 0 son of Bharata, belong to godly men endowed with divine nature. 
PURPORT 
In the beginning of the Fifteenth Chapter, the banyan tree of this 
material world was explained. The extra roots coming out of it were 
compared to the activities of the living entities, some auspicious, some 
inauspicious. In the Ninth Chapter, also, the devas, or godly, and the 
asuras, the ungodly, or demons, were explained. Now, according to Vedic 
rites, activities in the mode of goodness are considered auspicious for 
progress on the path of liber�tion, and such activities are known as deva-
Texts l-3] 
The Divine and Demoniac Nature's 
723· 
prakrti, transcendental by nature. Those who are situated in the transcen­
dental nature make progress on the path of liberation. For those who are 
acting in the modes of passion and 'ignorance, on the other hand, there is 
no possibility of liberation. Either they will have to remain in this 
material world as human beings, or they will descend among the species of 
animals or even lower life forms. In this Sixteenth Chapter the Lord 
explains both the transcendental nature and its attendant qualities, as well 
as the demoniac nature and its qualities. He also explains the advantages 
and disadvantages of these qualities. 
The word abhijiitasya in reference to one born of transcendental quali­
ties or godly tendencies is very significant. To beget a child in a godly 
atmosphere is known in the Vedic scriptures as Garbhiidhiina-saritskiira. 
If the parents want a child in the godly qualities they should follow the 
ten principles of the human being. In Bhagavad-gitii we have studied also 
before that sex life for begetting a good child is Kr�IJ.a Himself. Sex life is 
not condemned provided the process is used in Kr�IJ.a consciousness. 
Those who are in Kr�IJ.a consciousness at least should not beget children 
like cats and dogs but should beget them so they may become Kn;IJ.a 
conscious after birth. That should be the advantage of children born of a 
father or mother absorbed in Kn;l).a consciousness. 
The social institution known as varriisrama-dharma-the institution 
dividing society into four divisions or castes-is not meant to divide human 
society according to birth. Such divisions are in terms of educational 
qualifications. They are to keep the society in a state of peace and 
prosperity. The qualities mentioned herein are explained as transcendental 
qualities meant for making a person progress in spiritual understanding so 
he can get liberated from the material world. In the varpiisrama institution 
the sannyiisi, or the person in the renounced order of life, is considered to 
be the head or the spiritual master of all the social statuses and orders. 
A briihmara is considered to be the spiritual master of the three other 
sections of a society, namely, the k�atriyas, the vaisyas and the sudras, but 
a sannyiisi, who is on the top of the institution_,is considered to be the 
spiritual master of the briihmaras also. For a sannyiisi, the first qualifica­
tion should be fearlessness. Because a sannyiisi has to be alone without 
any support or guarantee of support, he has simply to depend on the 
mercy of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. If he thinks, "After 
leaving my connections, who will protect me?" he should not accept the 
renounced order of life. One must be fully convinced that Kr�IJ.a or the 
Supreme Personality of Godhead in His localized aspect as Paramatma is 
always within, that He is seeing everything and He always knows what one 
724 
Bhagavad-gita As It Is 
[Ch. 16 
intends to do. One must thus have firm conviction that Kr�lJ.a as 
Paramatma will take care of a soul surrendered to Him. "I shall never be 
alone," one should think. "Even if I live in the darkest regions of a forest 
I shall be accompanied by Kr�pa, and He will give me all protection." 
That conviction is called abhayam, without fear. This state of mind is 
necessary for a person in the renounced order of life. Then he has to 
purify his existence. There are so many rules and regulations to be fol­
lowed in the renounced order of life. Most important of all, a sannyiisi is 
strictly forbidden to have any intimate relationship with a woman. He is 
even forbidden to talk with a woman in a secluded place. Lord Caitanya 
was an ideal sannyiisi, and when He was at Puri His feminine devotees 
could not even come near to offer their respects. They were advised to 
bow down from a distant place. This is not a sign of hatred for women as 
a class, but it is a stricture imposed on the sannyiisi not to have close 
connections with women. One has to follow the rules and regulations of a 
particular status of life in order to purify his existence. For a sannyiisi, 
intimate relations with women and possessions of wealth for sense gratifi­
cation are strictly forbidden. The ideal sannyiisi was Lord Caitanya 
Himself, and we can learn from His life that He was very strict in regards 
to women. Although He is considered to be the most liberal incarnation of 
Godhead, accepting the most fallen conditioned souls, He strictly fol­
lowed the rules and regulations of the sannyiisa order of the life in 
connection with association with woman. One of His personal associates, 
namely Chota Haridasa, was personally associated with Lord Caitanya, along 
with His other confidential personal associates, but somehow or other this 
Chota Haridasa looked lustily on a young woman, and Lord Caitanya was 
so strict that He at once rejected him from the society of His personal 
associates. Lord Caitanya said, "For a sannyiisi or anyone who is aspiring 
to get out of the clutches of material nature and trying to elevate himself 
to the spiritual nature and go back to home, back to Godhead, for him, 
looking toward material possessions and women for sense gratification­
not even enjoying them, but just looking toward them with such � 
propensity-is so condemned that he had better commit suicide before 
experiencing such illicit desires." So these are the processes for purifica­
tion. 
The next item is jniina-yoga-vyavasthiti�: being engaged in the cultiva­
tion of knowledge. Sannyiisi life is meant for distributing knowledge to 
the householders and 
others 
who 
have forgotten 
their real life of 
spiritual advancement. A sannyiisi is supposed to beg from door to door 
for his livelihood, but this does not mean that he is a beggar. Humility is also 
L
Texts l-3] 
The Divine and Demoniac Natures 
725 
one of the qualifications of a transcendentally situated person, and out of 
sheer humility the sannyiisi goes from door to door, not exactly for the 
purpose of begging, but to see the householders and awaken them to 
Kr�l)a consciousness. This is the duty of a sannyiisi. If he is actually 
advanced and so ordered by his spiritual master, he should preach Kr�J;ta 
consciousness with logic and understanding, and if he is not so advanced 
, 
he should not accept the renounced order of life. But even if he has 
accepted the renounced order of .life without sufficient knowledge, he 
should engage himself fully in hearing from a bona fide spiritual master to 
cultivate knowledge. A sannyiisi or one in the renounced order of life 
must be situated in fearlessness, sattva-samsuddhi{l (purity) and jiiiina­
yoga (knowledge). 
The next item is charity. Charity is meant for the householders. The 
householders should earn a livelihood by an honorable means and spend 
fifty percent of their income to propagate Kr�l)a consciousness all over 
the world. Thus a householder should give in charity to such institutional 
societies that are engaged in that way. Charity should be given to the right 
receiver. There are different kinds of charities, as will be explained later 
on, charity in the modes of goodness, passion and ignorance. Charity in the 
mode of goodness is recommended by the scriptures, but charity in the 
modes of passion and ignorance is not recommended because it is simply a 
waste of money. Charity should be given only to propagate Kr�pa con­
sciousness all over the world. That is charity in the mode of goodness. 
Then as far as dama{l (self-control) is concerned, it is not only meant 
for other orders of religious society, but it is especially meant for the 
householder. Although he has a wife, a householder should not use his 
senses for sex life unnecessarily. There are restrictions for the house­
holders even in sex life, which should only be engaged in for the propaga­
tion of children. If he does not require children, he should not enjoy sex 
life with his wife. Modern society enjoys sex life with contraceptive 
methods or more abominable methods to avoid the responsibility of 
children. This is not in the transcendental quality but is demoniac. If 
anyone, even if he is a householder, wants to make progress in spiritual 
life, he must control his sex life and should not beget a child without 
the purpose of serving Kr�pa. If he is able to beget children who will be 
in Kr�l)a consciousness, one can produce hundreds of children, but with­
out this capacity one should not indulge only for sense pleasure. 
726 
Bhagavad-glta As It Is 
[Ch. 16 
Sacrifice is another item to be performed by the householders because 
sacrifices require a large amount of money. Other orders of life, namely 
the brahmacarya, the viinaprastha and sannyiisa, have no money; they live 
by begging. So performance of different types of sacrifice is meant for the 
householder. They should perform agni-hotra sacrifices as enjoined in the 
Vedic literature, but such sacrifices at the present moment are very 
expensive, and it is not possible for any householder to perform them. 
The best sacrifice recommended in this age is called sankirtana-yajiia, the 
chanting of Hare Kr�pa, Hare Kr�pa, Kr�pa Kr�pa, Hare Hare/Hare Rama, 
Hare Rama, Rama Rama, Hare Hare. This is the best and most inexpensive 
sacrifice; everyone can adopt it and derive benefit. So these three items, 
namely charity, sense control and performance of sacrifice, are meant for 
the householder. 
Then sviidh yiiya�, Vedic study, and tapas, austerity, and iirjavam, gentle­
ness or simplicity, are meant for the brahmacarya or student life. 
Brahmaciiris should have no connection with women; they should live a 
life of celibacy and engage the mind in the study of Vedic literature for 
cultivation of spiritual knowledge. This is called sv/idhyiiya�. Tapas or 
austerity is especially meant for the retired life. One should not remain a 
householder throughout his whole life; he must always remember that 
there are four divisions of life, brahmacarya, grhastha, viinaprastha and 
sannyiisa. So after grhastha, householder life, one should retire. If one lives 
for a hundred years, he should spend twenty-five years in student life, 
twenty-five in householder life, twenty-five in retired life and twenty-five 
in the renounced order of life. These are the regulations of the Vedic 
religious discipline. A_ man retired from household life must practice 
austerities of the body, mind and tongue. That is tapasyii. The entire 
va'?liisrama-dharma society is meant for tapasyii. Without tapasyii or 
austerity no human being can get liberation. The theory that there is no 
need of austerity in life, that one can go on speculating and everything 
will be nice, is neither recommended in the Vedic literature nor in 
Bhagavad-gitii. Such theories are manufactured by showbottle spiritualists 
who are trying to gather more followers. If there are restrictions, rules 
and regulations, people will not become attracted. Therefore those who 
want followers in the name of religion, just to have a show only, don't 
restrict the lives of their students nor their own lives. But that method is· 
not approved by the Vedas. 
As far as simplicity is concerned, not only should a particular order of 
life follow this principle, but every member, be he in the brahmacarya-

asrama, or grhastha-asrama or vanaprastha-asrama. One must live very 
simply. 
Ahirhsa means not arresting the progressive life of any living entity. One 
should not think that since the spirit spark is never killed even after the 
killing of the body there is no harm in killing animals for sense gratifica­
tion. People are now addicted to eating animals, in spite of having an 
ample supply of grains, fruits and milk. There is no necessity for animal 
killing. This injunction is for everyone. When there is no other alternative, 
one may kill an animal, but it should be offered in sacrifice. At any rate, 
when there is an ample food supply for humanity, persons who are 
desiring to make advancement in spiritual realization should not commit 
violence to animals. Real ahirhsa means not checking anyone's progressive 
life .. The animals are also making progress in their evolutionary life by 
transmigrating from one category of animal life to another. If a particular 
animal is killed, then his progress is checked. If an animal is staying in a 
particular body for so many days or so many years and is untimely killed, 
then he has to come back again in that form of life to complete the 
remaining days in order to be promoted to another species of life. So 
their progress should not be checked simply to satisfy one's palate. This is 
called ahimsa. 
Satyam. This word means that one should not distort the truth for 
some personal interest. 
In Vedic literature there are some difficult 
passag({s, but the meaning or the purpose should be learned from a bona 
fide spiritual master. That is the process for understanding Vedas. Sruti 
means that one should hear from the authority. One should not construe 
some interpretation for his personal interest. There are so many commen­
taries on Bhagavad-gita that misinterpret the original text. The real import 
of the word should be presented, and that should be learned from a bona 
fide spiritual master. 
Akrodha� means to check anger. Even if there is provocation one should 
be tolerant, for once one becomes angry his whole body becomes pol­
luted. Anger is the product of the modes of passion and lust, so one who 
is transcendentally situated should check himself from anger. ApaiSunam 
means that one should not find fault with others or correct them unneces­
sarily. Of course to call a thief a thief is not faultfinding, but to call an 
honest person a thief is very much offensive for one who is making 
advancement in spiritual life. Hrifl means that one should be very modest 
and must not perform some act which is abominable. Acapalam, determi­
nation, means that one should not be agitated or frustrated in some 
728 
Bhagavad-gWi As It Is ' 
[Ch. 16 
attempt. There may be failure in some attempt, but one should not be 
sorry for that; he should make progress with patience and determination. 
The word tejaft used here is meant for the k�atriyas. The k�atriyas should 
always be very strong to be able to give protection to the weak. They 
should not pose themselves as nonviolent. If violence is required, they 
must exhibit it. 
Saucam means cleanliness, not only in mind and body but in one's 
dealings also. It is especially meant for the mercantile people, who should 
not deal in the black market. Niitimiinitii, not expecting honor, applies to 
the siidras, the worker class, which are considered, according to Vedic 
injunctions, to be the lowest of the four classes. They should not be 
puffed up with unnecessary prestige or honor and should remain in their 
own status. It is the duty of the siidras to offer respect to the higher class 
for the upkeep of the social order. 
All these sixteen qualifications mentioned are transcendental qualities. 
They should be cultivated according to the different statuses ofthe social 
order. The purport is that even though material conditions are miserable, 
if these qualities are developed by practice, by all classes of men, then 
gradually it is possible to rise to the highest platform of transcendental 
realization.

PURPORT 
In this verse, the royal road to hell is described. The demoniac want to 
make a show of religion and advancement in spiritual science, although 
they do not follow the principles. They are always arrogant or proud in 
possessing some type of education or so much wealth. They desire to he 
worshiped by others, and demand respectability, although they do not 
command respect. Over trifles they become very angry and speak harshly, 
not gently. They do not know what should he done and what should not 
he done. They do everything whimsically, according to their ow.n desire, 
·and they do not recognize any authority. These demoniac qualities are 
taken on by them from the beginning of their bodies in the wombs of 
their mothers, and as they grow they manifest all these inauspicious 
qualities.

you are born with the divine qualities. 
PURPORT 
Lord Kr�rta encouraged Arjuna by telling him that he was not horn with 
demoniac qualities. His involvement in the fight was not demoniac 
730 
Bhagavad-g1ta As It Is 
[Ch. 16 
because he was considering the pro's and con's. He was considering 
whether respectable persons such as Bh�ma and Dropa should be killed or 
not, so he was not acting under the influence of anger, false prestige, or 
harshness. Therefore he was not of the quality of the demons. For a 
k§atriya, a military man, shooting arrows at the enemy is considered 
transcendental, and refraining from such a duty is demoniac. Therefore, 
there was no cause for Arjuna to lament. Anyone who performs the 
regulated principles of the different orders of life is transcendentally 
situated.

PURPORT 
Lord Kr�pa , having assured Arjuna that he was born with the divine 
qualities, is now describing the demoniac way. The conditioned living 
entities are divided into two classes in this world. Those who are born 
with divine qualities follow a regulated life; that is to say they abide by 
the injunctions in scriptures and by the authorities. One should perform 
duties in the light of authoritative scripture. This mentality is called 
Text 7) 
The Divine and Demoniac Natures 
731 
divine. One who does not follow the regulative principles as they are laid 
down in the scriptures and who acts according to his whims is called 
demoniac or asuric. There is no other criterion but obedience to the 
regulative principles of scriptures. It is mentioned in Vedic literature that 
both the demigods and the demons are born of the Prajapati; the only 
difference is that one class obeys the Vedic injunctions and the other does 
not.

TRANSLATION 
Those who are demoniac do not know what is to be done and what is 
not to he done. Neither cleanliness nor proper behavior nor truth is found 
in them. 
PURPORT 
In every civilized human society there is some set of scriptural rules 
and regulations which are followed from the beginning, especially among 
the Aryans, those who adopt the Vedic civilization and who are known as 
the most advanced civilized peoples. Those who do not follow the 
scriptural injunctions are supposed to be demons. Therefore it is stated 
here that the demons do not know the scriptural rules, nor do they have 
any inclination to follow them. Most of them do not know them, and 
even if some of them know, they have not the tendency to follow them. 
They have no faith, nor are they willing to act in terms of the Vedic 
injunctions. The demons are not clean, either externally or internally. 
732 
Bhagavad-gitii As It Is 
[Ch. 16 
One should always be careful to keep his body clean by bathing, brushing 
teeth, changing clothes, etc. As far as internal cleanliness is concerned, 
one should always remember the holy names of God and chant Hare 
:Kf�pa, Hare :Kf�pa, :Kf�pa Kr�pa, Hare Hare/Hare Rama, Hare Rama, 
Rama Rama, Hare Hare. The demons neither like nor follow all these rules 
for external and internal cleanliness. 
As for behavior, there are many rules and regulations guiding human 
behavior, such as the Manu-sarhhitii, which is the law of the human race. 
Even up to today, those who are Hindu follow the Manu-samhitii. Laws of 
inheritance and other legalities are derived from this book. Now, in the 
Manu-sarhhitii, it is clearly stated that a woman should not be given free­
dom. That does not mean that women are to be kept as slaves, but they 
are like children. Children are not given freedom, but that does not mean 
that they are kept as slaves. The demons have now neglected such 
injunctions, and they think that women should be given as much freedom 
as men. However, this has not improved the social condition of the world. 
Actually, a woman should be given protection at every stage of life. She 
should be given protection by the father in her younger days, by the 
husband in her youth, and by the grownup sons in her old age. This is 
proper social behavior according to the Manu-samhitii. But modern 
education has artificially devised a puffed up concept of womanly life, 
and therefore marriage is practically now an imagination in human 
society. Nor is the moral condition of woman very good now. The 
demons, therefore, do not accept any instruction which is good for 
society, and because they do not follow the experience of great sages and 
the rules and regulations laid down by the sages, the social condition of 
the demoniac people is very miserable.

TRANSLATION 
They say that this world is unreal, that there is no foundation and that 
there is no God in control. It is p,roduced of sex desire, and has no cause 
other than lust. 
PURPORT 
The demoniac conclude that the world is phantasmagoria. There is no 
cause, no effect, no controller, no purpose: everything is unreal. They say 
that this cosmic manifestation arises due to chance material actions and 
reactions. They do not think that the world was cr.eated by God for a 
certain purpose. They have their own theory: that the world has come 
about in its own way and that there is no reason to believe that there is a 
God behind it. For them there is no difference between spirit and matter, 
and they do not accept the Supreme Spirit. Everything is matter only, and 
the whole cosmos is supposed to be a mass of ignorance. According to 
them, everything is void, and whatever manifestation exists is due to our 
ignorance in perception. They take it for granted that all manifestation of 
diversity is a display of ignorance. Just as in a dream we may create so 
many things, which actually have no existence, so when we are awake we 
shall see that everything is simply a dream. But factually, although the 
demdns say that life is a dream, they are very expert in enjoying this 
dream. And so, instead of acquiring knowledge, they become more and 
more implicated in their dreamland. They conclude that as a child is 
simply· the result of sexual intercourse between man and woman, this 
world is born without any soul. For them it is only a combination of 
matter that has produced the living entities, and there is no question of 
the existence of the soul. As many living creatures come out from perspi­
ration and from a dead body without any cause, similarly, the whole living 
world has come out of the material combinations of the cosmic manifes­
tation. Therefore material nature is the cause of this manifestation, and 
there is no other cause. They do not believe in the words of Kr�p.a in 
Bhagavad-gitii: mayiidhyak�epa prakrti[t siiyate sa-cariicaram. "Under My 
direction the whole material world is moving." In other words, amongst 
the demons there is no perfect knowledge of the creation of this world; 
every one of them has some particular theory of his own. According to 
734 
Bhagavad-glta As It Is 
[Ch. 16 
them, one interpretation of the scriptures is as good as another, for they 
do not believe in a standard understanding of the scriptural injunctions.

TRANSLATION 
Following such conclusions, the demoniac, who are lost to themselves 
and who have no intelligence, engage in unbeneficial, horrible works 
meant to destroy the world. 
PURPORT 
The demoniac are engaged in activities that will lead the world to 
destruction. The Lord states here that they are less intelligent. The 
materialists, who have no concept of God, think that they are advancing. 
But, according to Bhagavad-gitii, they are unintelligent and devoid of all 
sense. They try to enjoy this material world to the utmost limit and 
therefore always engage in inventing something for sense gratification. 
Such materialistic inventions are considered to be advancement of human 
civilization, but the result is that people grow more and more violent and 
more and more cruel, cruel to animals and cruel to other human beings. 
They have no idea how to behave toward one another. Animal killing is 
a. 
very prominent amongst demoniac people. Such people are considered the 
enemies of the world because ultimately they will invent or create some­
thing which will bring destruction to all. Indirectly, this verse anticipates 
l

the invention· of nuclear weapons, of which the whole world is today very 
proud. At any moment war may take place, and these atomic weapons 
may create havoc. Such things are created solely for the destruction of 
the world, and this is indicated here. Due to godlessness, such weapons are 
invented in human society; they are not meant for the peace and 
prosperity of the world.

The demoniac, taking shelter of insatiable lust, pride and false prestige, 
and being thus illusioned, are always sworn to unclean work, attracted by 
the impermanent. 
PURPORT 
The demoniac mentality is described here. The demons' lust is never 
satiated. They will go on increasing and increasing their insatiable desires 
for material enjoyment. Although they are always full of anxieties on 
account of accepting nonpermanent things, they still continue to engage 
in such activities out of illusion. They have no knowledge and cannot tell 
that they are heading the wrong way. Accepting nonpermanent things, 
such demoniac people create their own God, create their own hymns, and 
chant accordingly. The result is that they become more and more 
attracted to two things-sex enjoyment and accumulation of material 
736 
Bhagavad-glta As It Is 
[Ch. 16 
wealth. The word asuci-vratiifz, unclean vow, is very significant in this 
connection. Such demoniac people are only attracted by wine, women, 
gambling and meat eating; those are their aSuci, unclean habits. Induced 
by pride and false prestige, they create some principles of religion which 
are not approved by the Vedic injunctions. Although such demoniac 
people are most abominable in the world, still, by artificial means, the 
world creates a false honor for them. Although they are gliding toward 
hell, they consider themselves very much advanced.

They believe that to gratify the senses unto the end of life is the prime

Texts 13-15] 
The Divine and Demoniac Natures 
737 
Being bound by hundreds and thousands of desires, by lust and anger, they 
secure money by illegal means for sense gratification. 
PURPORT 
The demoniac accept that the enjoyment of the senses is the ultimate 
goal of life, and this concept they maintain until death. They do not 
believe in life after death, and they do not believe that one takes on 
different types of bodies according to one's karma, or activities in this 
world. Their plans for life are never finished, and they go on preparing 
plan after plan, all of which are never finished. We have personal 
experience of a person of such demoniac mentality, who, even at the 
point of death, was requesting the physician to prolong his life for four 
years more because his plans were not yet complete. Such foolish people 
do not know that a physician cannot prolong life even for a moment. 
When the notice is there, there is no consideration of the man's desire. 
The laws of nature do not allow a second beyond what one is destined to 
enjoy. 
The demoniac person, who has no faith in God or the Supersoul within 
himself, performs all kinds of sinful activities simply for sense gratifica­
tion. He does not know that there is a witness sitting within his heart. The 
Supersoul is observing the activities of the individual soul. As it is stated 
in the Vedic literature, the Upan�ads, there are two birds sitting in one 
tree; the one is acting and enjoying or suffering the fruits of the branches, 
and the other is witnessing. But one who is demoniac has no knowledge 
of Vedic scripture, nor has he any faith; therefore he feels free to do any­
thing for sense enjoyment, regardless of the consequences.

as I am. I shall perform sacrifices, I shall give some charity, and thus I shall 
rejoice." In this way, such persons are deluded by ignorance.

The demoniac man knows no limit to his desire to acquire money. That 
is unlimited. He only thinks how much assessment he has just now and 
schemes to engage that stock of wealth farther and farther. For that 
reason, he does not hesitate to act in any sinful way and so deals in the 
black market for illegal gratification. He is enamoured by the possessions 
he has already, such as land, family, house and bank balance, and he is 
always planning to improve them. He believes in his own strength, and he 
does not know that whatever he is gaining is due to his past good deeds. 
He is given an opportunity to accumulate such things, but he has no 
conception of past causes. He simply thinks that all his mass of wealth is 
due to his own endeavor. A demoniac person believes in the strength of 
his personal work, not in the law of karma. According to the law of karma, 
a man takes his birth in a high family, or becomes rich, or very ·well 
educated, or very beautiful because of good work in the past. The 
demoniac thinks that all these things are accidental and due to the strength 
of his personal ability. He does not sense any arrangement behind all the 
varieties of people, beauty, and education. Anyone who comes into 
competition with such a demoniac man is his enemy. There are many

demoniac people, and each is enemy to the others. This enmity becomes 
more and more deep-between persons, then between families, then 
between societies, and at last between nations. Therefore there is constant 
strife, war and enmity all over the world. 
Each demoniac person thinks that he can live at the sacrifice of all 
others. Generally, a demoniac person thinks of himself as the Supreme 
God, and a demoniac preacher tells his followers: "Why are you seeking 
God elsewhere? You are all yourselves God! Whatever you like, you can 
do. Don't believe in God. Throw away God. God is dead." These are the 
demoniac's preachings. 
Although the demoniac person sees others equally rich and influential, 
or even more so, he thinks that no one is richer than him and that no one 
is more influential than him. As far as promotion to the higher planetary 
system 
is concerned, he does not believe 
in performing yajnas or 
sacrifices. Demons think that they will manufacture their own process of 
yajna and prepare some machine, by which they will be able to reach any 
higher planet. The best example of such a demoniac man was Raval).a. He 
offered a program to the people by which he would prepare a staircase so 
that anyone could reach the heavenly planets without performing sacri­
fices, such as are prescribed in the Vedas. Similarly, in the present age 
such demoniac men are striving to reach the higher planetary systems by 
mechanical arrangement. These are examples of bewilderment. The result 
is that, without their knowledge, they are gliding toward hell. Here the 
Sanskrit word moha-jiila is very significant. ]iila means net; like fishes 
caught in a net, they have no way to come out.

TRANSLATION 
Self-complacent and always impudent, deluded by wealth and false 
prestige, they sometimes perform sacrifices in name only without following 
any rules or regulations. 
PURPORT 
Thinking themselves all in all, not caring for any authority or scripture, 
the demoniac sometimes perform so-called religious or sacrificial rites. 
And since they do not believe in authority, they are very impudent. This 
is due to illusion caused by accumulating some wealth and false prestige. 
Sometimes such demons take up the role of preacher, mislead the people, 
and become known as religious reformers or as incarnations of God. They 
make a show of performing sacrifices, or they worship the demigods, or 
manufacture their own God. Common men advertise them as God and 
worship them, and by the foolish they are considered advanced in the 
principles of religion, or in the principles of spiritual knowledge. They 
take the dress of the renounced order of life and engage in all nonsense in 
that dress. Actually there are so many restrictions for one who has re­
nounced this world. The demons, however, do not care for such restric­
tions. They think that whatever path one can create is one's own path; 
there is no such thing as a standard path one has to follow. The word 
avidhi-piiroakam, 
meaning disregard for the rules and regulations, is 
·especially stressed here. These things are always due to ignorance and 
illusion.

Bewildered by false ego, strength, pride, lust and anger, the demon 
becomes envious of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who is situated 
in his own body and in the bodies of others, and blasphemes against the 
real religion. 
PURPORT 
A demoniac person, being always against God's supremacy, does not 
like to believe in the scriptures. He is envious of both the scriptures and of 
the existence of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. This is caused by 
his so-called prestige and his accumulation of wealth and strength. He does 
not know that the present life is a preparation for the next life. Not 
knowing this, he is actually envious of his own self, as well as of others. 
He commits violence on other bodies and on his own. He does not care for 
the supreme control of the Personality of Godhead because he has no 
knowledge. Being envious of the scriptures and the Supreme Personality 
of Godhead, he puts forward false arguments against the existence of God 
and refutes the scriptural authority. He thinks himself independent and 
powerful in every action. He thinks that since no one can equal him in 
strength, power, or in wealth, he can act in any way and no one can stop 
him. If he has an enemy who might check the advancement of his sensual 
activities, he makes plans to cut him down by his own power.

TRANSLATION 
Those who are envious and mischievous, who are the lowest among men, 
are cast by Me into the ocean of material existence, into various demoniac 
species of life. 
PURPORT 
In this verse it is clearly indicated that the placing of a particular 
individual soul in a particular body is the prerogative of the supreme will. 
The demoniac person may not agree to accept the supremacy of the Lord, 
and it is a fact that he may act according to his own whims, but his next 
birth will depend upon the decision of the Supreme Personality of 
Godhead and not on himself. In the Srimad-Bhiigavatam, Third Canto, it 
is stated that an individual soul, after his death, is put into the womb of a 
mother where he gets a particular type of body under the supervision of 
superior power. Therefore in the material existence we find so many 
species of life-animals, insects, men, and so on. All are arranged by the 
superior power. They are not accidental. As for the demoniac, it is 
clearly said here that they are perpetually put into the wombs of demons, 
and thus they continue to be envious, the lowest of mankind. Such 
demoniac species of life are held to be always full of lust, always violent 
and hateful and always unclean. They are just like so many beasts in a 
jungle.

PURPORT 
It is known that God is all-merciful, hut here we find that God is never 
merciful to the demoniac. It is clearly stated that the demoniac people, 
life after life, are put into the wombs of similar demons, and, not 
achieving the mercy of the Supreme Lord, they go down and down, so 
that at last they achieve bodies like those of cats, dogs and hogs. It is 
clearly stated that such demons have practically no chance of receiving the 
mercy of God at any stage of later life. In the Vedas also it is stated that 
such persons gradually sink to become dogs and hogs. It may be then 
argued in this connection that God should not be advertised as all-merciful 
if He is not merciful to such demons. In answer to this question, in the 
Vediinta-siltra we find that the Supreme Lord has no hatred for anyone. 
The placing of the asuras, the demons, in the lowest status of life is 
simply another feature of His mercy. Sometimes the asuras are killed by 
the Supreme Lord, but this killing is also good for them, for in Vedic 
literature we find that anyone who is killed by the Supreme Lord becomes 
liberated. There are instances in history of many asuras-Ravapa, Kamsa, 
Hirapyakasipu-to whom the Lord appeared in various incarnations just to 
kill. Therefore God's mercy is shown to the asuras if they are fortunate 
enough to be killed by Him.

his lust, and when he cannot, anger and greed arise. A sane man who does 
not want to glide down to the species of demoniac life must try to give up 
these three enemies which can kill the self to such an extent that there 
will be no possibility of liberation from this material entanglement.

PURPORT 
One should be very careful of these three enemies to human life: lust, 
anger, and greed. The more a person is freed from lust, anger and greed, 
746 
Bhagavad-gita As It Is 
[Ch. 16 
the more his existence becomes pure. Then he can follow the rules and 
regulations enjoined in the Vedic literature. By following the regulative 
principles of human life, one gradually raises himself to the platform of 
spiritual realization. If one is so fortunate, by such practice, to rise to the 
platform of Kr�.p.a consciousness, then success is guaranteed for him. In 
the Vedic literature, the ways of action and reaction are prescribed to 
enable one to come to the stage of purification. The whole method is 
based on giving up lust, greed and anger. By cultivating knowledge of this 
process, one can be elevated to the highest position of self-realization; this 
self-realization is perfected in devotional service. lin that devotional ser­
vice, the liberation of the conditioned soul is gmaranteed. Therefore, 
according to the Vedic system, there are instituted the four orders of life 
and the four statuses of life, called the caste system and the spiritual order 
system. There are different rules and regulations for different castes or 
divisions of society, and if a person is able to follow them, he will be 
automatically raised to the highest platform of spiritual realization. Then 
he can have liberation without a doubt.

The Divine and Demoniac Natures 
747 
PURPORT 
As described before, the siistra-vidhim, or the direction of the �astra, is 
given to the different castes and orders of human society. Everyone is 
expected to follow these rules and regulations. If one does not follow 
them and acts whimsically according to his lust, greed and desire, then he 
never will be perfect in his life. In other words, a man may theoretically 
know all these things, but if he does not apply them in his own life, then 
he is to be known as the lowest of mankind. In the human form of life, a 
living entity is expected to be sane and to follow the regulations given for 
elevating his life to the highest platform, but if he does not follow them, 
then he degrades himself. But even if he follows the rules and regulations 
and moral principles and ultimately does not come to the stage of under­
standing the Supreme Lord, then all his knowledge becomes spoiled. 
Therefore one should gradually raise himself to the platform of Kr�pa 
consciousness and devotional service; it is then and there that he can 
attain the highest perfectional stage, not otherwise. 
The word kiima-ciirata� is very significant. A person who knowingly 
violates the rules acts in lust. He knows that this is forbidden, still he acts. 
This is called acting whimsically. He knows that this should be done, but 
still he does not do it; therefore he is called whimsical. Such persons are 
destined to be condemned by the Supreme Lord. Such persons cannot 
have the perfection which is meant for the human life. The human life is 
especially meant for purifying one's existence, and one who does not 
follow the rules and regulations cannot purify himself, nor can he attain 
the real stage of happiness.

TRANSLATION 
One should understand what is duty and what is not duty by the 
regulations of the scriptures. Knowing such rules and regulations, one 
should act so that he may gradually be elevated. 
PURPORT 
As stated in the Fifteenth Chapter, all the rules and regulations of the 
Vedas are meant for knowing Kr�pa. If one understands Kr�pa from the 
Bhagavad-gita and becomes situated in Kr�pa consciousness, engaging him­
self in devotional service, he has reached the highest perfection of know­
ledge offered by the Vedic literature. Lord Caitanya Mahaprabhu made 
this process very easy: He asked p�ople simply to chant Hare Kr�pa, Hare 
Kr�l).a, Kr�l}a Kr�l}a, Hare Hare/ Hare Rama, Hare Rama, Rama Rama, 
Hare Hare and to engage in the devotional service of the Lord and eat the 
remnants of foodstuff offered to the Deity. One who is directly engaged 
in all these devotional activities is to be understood as having studied all 
Vedic literature. He has come to the conclusion perfectly. Of course, for 
the ordinary persons who are not in Kr�pa consciousness or who are not 
engaged in devotional service, what is to be done and what is not to be 
done must be decided by the injunctions of the Vedas. One should act 
accordingly, without argument. That is called following the principles of 
sastra, or scripture. Sastra is without the four principal defects that are 
visible in the conditioned soul: imperfect senses, the propensity for 
cheating, certainty of committing mistakes, and certainty of being illu­
sioned. These four principal defects in conditioned life disqualify one from 
putting forth rules and regulations. Therefore, the rules and regulations as 
described in the siistra-being above these defects-are accepted without 
alteration by all great saints, iiciiryas, and great souls. 
In India there are many parties of spiritual understanding, generally 
classified as two: . the impersonalist and the personalist. Both of them, 
however, lead their lives according to the principles of the Vedas. Without 
following the principles of the scriptures, one cannot elevate himself to 
the perfectional stage. One who actually, therefore, understands the pur­
port of the sastras is considered fortunate. 
In human society, aver�ion to the principles of understanding the 
Supreme Personality of Godhead is the cause of all falldowns. That is the 
\-
•Wi" 
r•

greatest offense of human life. Therefore, miiyii, the material energy of 
the Supreme Personality of Godhead, is always giving us trouble in the 
shape of the threefold miseries. This material energy is constituted of the 
three modes of material nature. One has to raise himself at least t,o the 
mode of goodness before the path to understanding the Supreme Lord can 
be opened. Without raising oneself to the standard of the mode of good­
ness, one remains in ignorance and passion, which are the cause of 
demoniac life. Those in the modes of passion and ignorance deride the 
scriptures, deride the holy man, and deride the proper understanding of the 
spiritual master, and they do not care for the regulations of the scriptures. 
In spite of hearing the glories of devotional service, they are not attracted. 
Thus they manufacture their own way of elevation. These are some of 
the defects of human society, which lead to the demoniac status of life. 
If, however, one is able to be guided by a proper and bona fide spiritual 
master, who can lead one to the path of elevation, to the higher stage, 
then one's life becomes successful. 
Thus end the Bhaktivedanta Purports to the Sixteenth Chapter of the 
Srimad-Bhagavad-gita in the matter of the Divine and Demoniac· Natures.

TRANSLATION 
Arjuna said, 0 Kr�pa, what is the situation of one who does not follow 
the principles of scripture but worships according to his own imagination? 
Is he in goodness, in passion or in ignorance? 
PURPORT 
In the Fourth Chapter, thirty-ninth verse, it is said that a person faithful 
to a particular type of worship gradually becomes elevated to the stage of 
knowledge and attains the highest perfectional stage of peace and pros­
perity. In the Sixteenth Chapter, it is concluded that one who does not 
follow the principles laid down in the scriptures is called an asura, demon, 
and one who follows the scriptural injunctions faithfully is called a deva, 
or demigod. Now, if one, with faith, follows some rules which are not 
mentioned in the scriptural injunctions, what is his position? This doubt 
of Arjuna is to be cleared by Kr�p.a. Are those who create some sort of God 
by selecting a human being and placing their faith in him worshiping in 
goodness, passion or ignorance? Do such persons attain the perfectional 
stage of life? Is it possible for them to be situated in real knowledge and 
elevate themselves to the highest perfectional stage? Do those who do not 
follow the rules and regulations of the scriptures but who have faith in 
something and worship gods and demigods and men attain success in 
their effort? Arjuna is putting these questions to Kr�p.a.

TRA NSLATION 
The Supreme Lord said, according to the modes of nature acquired by 
the embodied soul, one's faith can be of three kinds-goodness, passion or 
ignorance. Now hear about these. 
PURPORT 
Those who know the rules and regulations of the scriptures, but, out of 
laziness or indolence, give up following these rules and regulations, are 
governed by the modes of material nature. According to their previous 
activities in the modes of goodness, passion or ignorance, they acquire a 
nature which is of a specific quality. The association of the living entity 
with the different modes of nature has been going on perpetually since the 
living entity is in contact with material nature. Thus he acquires different 
types of mentality according to his association with the material modes. 
But this nature can be changed if one associates with a bona fide spiritual 
master and abides by his rules and the scriptures. Gradually, one can change 
his position from ignorance to goodness, or from passion to goodness. The 
conclusion is that blind faith in a particular mode of nature cannot help a 
person become elevated to the perfectional stage. One has to consider 
things carefully, with intelligence, in the association of a bona fide 
spiritual master. Thus one can change his position to a higher mode of 
nature.

Bhagavad-gita As It Is 
[Ch. 17 
TRANSLATION 
According to one's existence under the various modes of nature, one 
evolves a particular kind of faith. The living being is said to he of a 
particular faith according to the modes he has acquired. 
PURPORT 
Everyone has a particular type of faith, regardless of what he is. But his 
·faith is considered good, passionate or ignorant according to the nature he 
has acquired. Thus, according to his particular type of faith, one associates 
with certain persons. Now the real fact is that every living being, as is 
stated in the Fifteenth Chapter, is originally the fragmental part and parcel 
of the Supreme Lord. Therefore one is originally transcendental to all the 
modes of material nature. But when one forgets his relationship with the 
Supreme Personality of Godhead and comes into contact with the material 
nature in conditional life, he generates his own position by association with 
the different varieties of material nature. The resultant artificial faith and 
existence are only material. Although one may be conducted by some 
impression, or some conception of life, still, originally, he is nirgu[ta, or 
transcendental. Therefore one has to become cleansed of the material 
contamination that he has acquired in order to regain his relationship with 
the Supreme Lord. That is the only path back without fear: Kr�tJ.a 
consciousness. If one is situated in Kr�!la consciousness, then that path is 
guaranteed for his elevation to the perfectional stage. If one does not take 
to this path of self-realization, then he is surely to be conducted by the 
influence of the modes of nature. 
The word sattva, or faith, is very significant in this verse. Sattva or 
faith always comes out of the works of goodness. One's faith may be in a 
demigod or some created God or some mental concoction. It is supposed 
to be one's strong faith in something that is productive of the works of 
material goodness. But in material conditional life, no works of material 
nature are completely purified. They are mixed. They are not in pure 
goodness. Pure goodness is transcendental; in purified goodness one can 
understand the real nature of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. As 
long as one's faith is not completely in purified goodness, the faith is 
subject to contamination by any of the modes of material nature. The 
contaminated modes of material nature expand to the heart. Therefore 
according to the position of the heart in contact with a particular mode of 
material nature, one's faith is established. It should be understood, that if

one's heart is in the mode of goodness, his faith is also in the mode of 
goodness. If his heart is in the mode of passion, his faith is also in the mode 
of passion. And if his heart is in the mode of darkness, illusion, his faith is 
also thus contaminated, Thus we find different types of faith in this 
·1
world, and there are different types of religions due to different types of 
faith. The real principle of religious faith is situated in the mode of pure 
goodness, but because the heart is tainted, we find different types of 
religious principles. Thus according to different types of faith, there are 
different kinds of worship.

TRANSLATION 
Men in the mode of goodness worship the demigods; those in the mode 
of passion worship the demons; and those in the mode of ignorance 
worship ghosts and spirits. 
PURPORT 
In this verse the Supreme Personality of Godhead describes different 
kinds of worshipers according to their external activities. According to 
scriptural injunction, only the Supreme Personality of Godhead is worship­
able, but those who are not very conversant with, or faithful to, the 
scriptural injunctions worship 
different 
objects, 
according to their 
756 
Bhagavad-gita As It Is 
[Ch. 17 
specific situations· in the modes of material nature. Those who are 
situated 
in goodness generally worship the demigods. The demigods 
include Brahma, Siva and others such as Indra, Candra and the sun-god. 
There are various demigods. Those in goodness worship a particular 
demigod for a particular purpose. Similarly, those who are in the mode of 
passion worship the demons. We recall that during the Second World War, 
a man in Calcutta worshiped Hitler because thanks to that war he had 
amassed a large amount of wealth by dealing in the black market. 
Similarly, those in the modes of passion and ignorance generally select a 
powerful man to be God. They think that anyone can be worshiped as God 
and that the same results will be obtained. 
Now, it is clearly described here that those who are in the mode of 
passion worship and create such gods, and those who are in the mode of 
ignorance, in darkness, worship dead spirits. Sometimes people worship at 
the tomb of some dead man. Sexual service is also considered to be in the 
mode of darkness. 
Similarly, 
in remote villages in India there are 
worshipers of ghosts. We have seen that in India the lower class people 
sometimes go to the forest, and if they have knowledge that a ghost lives 
in a tree, they worship that tree and offer sacrifices. These different kinds 
of worship are not actually God worship. God worship is for persons who 
are transcendentally situated in pure goodness. In the Srimad-Bhiigavatam 
it is said, sattvarh visuddham viisudeva-sabditam. "When a man is situated 
in pure goodness, he worships Vasudeva." The purport is that those who 
are completely purified of the material modes of nature and who are 
transcendentally situated 
can 
worship 
the 
Supreme 
Personality 
of 
Godhead. 
The impersonalists are supposed to be situated in the mode of 
goodness, and they worship five kinds of demigods. They worship the 
impersonal Vi�!J.U, or Vi�!J.U form in the material world, which is known as 
philosophized Viwu. Vi�!J.U is the expansion of the Supreme Personality of 
Godhead, but the impersonalists, because they do not ultimately believe in 
the Supreme Personality of. Godhead, imagine that the Vi�!J.U form is just 
another aspect of the impersonal Brahman; similarly, they imagine that 
Lord Brahma is the impersonal form in the material mode of passion. Thus 
they so�etimes describe five kinds of gods that are worshipable, but 
because they think that the actual truth is impersonal Brahman, they 
dispose of all worshipable objects at the ultimate end. In conclusion, the 
different qualities of the material modes of nature can be purified through 
·association with persons who are of transcendental nature.

end, 
is 
not 
mentioned in the scriptural directions. The scriptures 
recommend fasting for spiritual advancement, not for some political end 
or social purpose. Persons who take to such austerities are, according to 
Rhagavad-gitii, certainly demoniac. Their acts are against the scriptural 
injunction and are not beneficial for the people in general. Actually, they 
act out of pride, false ego, lust and attachment for material enjoyment. By 
such activities, not only are the combination of material elements of which 
the body is constructed disturbed, but also the Supreme Personality of 
Godhead Himself living within the body. Such unauthorized fasting or 
austerities for some political end are certainly very disturbing to others. 
They are not mentioned in the Vedic literature. A demoniac person may 
think that he can force his enemy or other parties to comply with his 
desire by this method, but sometimes one dies by such fasting. These acts 
are not approved by the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and He says 
that those who engage in them are demons. Such demonstrations are 
insults to the Supreme Personality of Godhead because they are enacted in 
disobedience to the Vedic scriptural injunctions. The word acetasa� is 
significant in this connection-persons of normal mental condition must 
obey the scriptural injunctions. Those who are not in such a position 
neglect and disobey the scriptures and manufacture their own way of 
austerities and penances. One should always remember the ultimate end of 
the demoniac people, as described in the previous chapter. The Lord forces 
them to take birth in the womb of demoniac persons. Consequently they 
will live by demoniac principles life after life without knowing their 
relationship with the Supreme Personality of Godhead. If, however, such 
persons are fortunate enough to be guided by a spiritual master who can 
direct them to the path of Vedic wisdom, they can get out of this 
entanglement and ultimately achieve the supreme goal.

TRANSLATION 
Even food of which all partake is of three kinds, according to the three 
modes of material nature. The same is true of sacrifices, austerities and 
charity. Listen, and I shall tell you of the distinctions of these. 
PURPORT 
In terms of different situations and the modes of material nature, there 
are differences in the manner of eating, performing sacrifices, austerities 
and charities. They are not all conducted on the same level. Those who 
can understand analytically what kind of performances are in what modes 
of material nature are actually wise; those who consider all kinds of 
sacrifice or foods or charity to be the same cannot discriminate, and they 
are foolish. There are missionary workers who advocate that one can do 
whatever he likes and attain perfection. But these foolish guides are not act­
mg according to the direction of the scripture. They are manufacturing 
ways and misleading the people in general.

1RANSLATION 
Foods in the mode of goodness increase the duration of life, purify one's 
existence and give strength, health, happiness and satisfaction. Such 
nourishing foods are sweet, juicy, fattening and palatable. Foods that are 
too bitter, too sour, salty, pungent, dry· and hot, are liked by people in the 
modes of passion. Such foods cause pain, distress, and disease. Food 
cooked more than three hours before being eaten, which is tasteless, stale, 
putrid, decomposed and unclean, is food liked by people in the mode of 
ignorance. 
PURPORT 
The purpose of food is to increase the duration of life, purify the mind 
and aid bodily strength. This is its only purpose. In the past, great 
authorities selected those foods that best aid health and increase life's 
Texts 8-10) 
The Divisions of Faith 
761 
duration, such as milk products, sugar, rice, wheat, fruits and vegetables. 
These foods are very dear to those in the mode of goodness. Some other 
foods, such as baked corn and molasses, while not very palatable in 
themselves, can be made pleasant when mixed with milk or other foods. 
They are then in the mode of goodness. All these foods are pure by nature. 
They are quite distinct from untouchable things like meat and liquor. 
Fatty foods, as mentioned in the eighth verse, have no connection with 
animal fat obtained by slaughter. Animal fat is available in the form of 
milk, which is the most wonderful of all foods. Milk, butter, cheese and 
similar products give animal fat in a form which rules out any need for the 
killing of innocent creatures. It is only through brute mentality that this 
killing goes on. The civilized method of obtaining needed fat is by milk. 
Slaughter is the way of subhumans. Protein is amply available through 
split peas, dhall, whole wheat, etc. 
Foods in the mode of passion, which are bitter, too salty, or too hot or 
overly mixed with red pepper, cause misery by producing mucous in the 
stomach, leading to disease. 'Foods in the mode of ignorance or darkness 
are essentially those that are not fresh. Any food cooked more than 
three hours before it is eaten (except prasiidam, food offered to the Lord) 
is considered to be in the mode of darkness. Because they are decomposing, 
such foods give a bad odor, which often attracts people in this mode but 
repulses those in the mode of goodness. 
Remnants of food may be eaten only when they are part of a meal that 
was first offered to the Supreme Lord or first eaten by saintly persons, 
especially the spiritual master. Otherwise the remnants of food are 
considered to be in the mode of darkness, and they increase infection or 
disease. Such foodstuffs, although very palatable to persons in the mode 
of darkness, are neither liked nor even touched by those in the mode of 
goodness. The best food is the remnant of what is offered to the Supreme 
Personality of G odhead. In Bhagavad-gitii the Supreme Lord says that He 
accepts preparations of vegetables, flour and milk when offered with 
devotion. Patrarh pu�parh phalarh toyam. Of course, devotion and love 
are the chief things which the Supreme Personality of Godhead accepts. 
But it is also mentioned that the prasiidam should be prepared in a 
particular way. Any food prepared by the injunction of the scripture 
offered to the Supreme Personality of Godhead can be taken even if 
prepared long, long ago, because such food is transcendental. Therefore to 
make food antiseptic, eatable and palatable for all persons, one should 
offer food to the Supreme Personality of Godhead.

TRANSLATION 
Of sacrifices, that sacrifice performed according to duty and to scriptural 
rules, and with no expectation of r-eward, is of the nature ef goodness. 
PURPORT 
The general tendency is to offer sacrifice with some purpose in mind, 
but here it is stated that sacrifice should be performed without any such 
desire. It should be done as a matter of duty. Take, for example, the 
performance of rituals in temples or in churches. Generally they are 
performed with the purpose of material benefit, but that is not in· the mode 
of goodness. One should go to a temple or church as a matter of duty, 
offer respect to the Supreme Personality of Godhead and offer flowers 
and eatables. Everyone thinks that there is no use in going to the temple 
just 
to 
worship 
God. 
But 
worship 
for economic benefit is not 
recommended in the scriptural injunction. One should go simply to offer 
respect to the Deity. That will place one in the mode of goodness. It is 
the duty of every civilized man to obey the injunctions of the scriptures 
and offer respect to the Supreme Personality of Godhead.

Faith in the mode of darkness or ignorance is actually faithlessness. 
Sometimes people worship some demigod just to make money and then 
spend the money for recreation, ignoring the scriptural injunctions. Such 
ceremonial shows of religiosity are not accepted as genuine. They are all 
in the mode of darkness; they produce a demoniac mentality and do not

TRANSLATION 
And serenity, simplicity, gravity, self-control and purity of thought 
are the austerities of the mind. 
PURPORT 
To make the mind austere is to detach it from sense gratification. It 
should be so trained that it can be always thinking of doing good for 
others. The best training for the mind is gravity in thought. One should 
not deviate from Kr�pa consciousness and must always avoid sense 
gratification. 
To purify one's nature is to become Kr�pa conscious. 
Satisfaction of the mind can be obtained only by taking the mind away 
from thoughts of sense enjoyment. The more we think of sense enjoyment, 
I

the more the mind becomes dissatisfied. In the present age we unnecessarily 
engage the mind in so many different ways for sense gratification, and so 
there is no possibility of the mind's becoming satisfied. The best course 
is to divert the mind to the Vedic literature, which is full of satisfying 
stories, as in the Puriirzas and the Mahiibhiirata. One can take advantage of 
this knowledge and thus become purified. The mind should be devoid 
of duplicity, and one should think of the welfare of all. Silence means that 
one is always thinking of self-realization. The person in Kr�pa conscious­
ness observes perfect silence in this sense. Control of the mind means 
detaching the mind from sense enjoyment. One should be straightforward 
in his dealing and thereby purify his existence. All these qualities together 
constitute austerity in mental activities.

And those penances and austerities which are performed foolishly by 
means of obstinant self-torture, or to destroy or injure others, are said to 
be in the mode of ignorance. 
PURPORT 
There are instances of foolish penance undertaken by demons like 
Hirapyakasipu, who performed austere penances to become immortal and 
kill the demigods. He prayed to Brahma for such things, but ultimately he 
was killed by the Supreme Personality of Godhead_ To undergo penances 
for something which is impossible is certainly in the mode of ignorance.

indiscriminately. Spiritual perfection is always a consideration. Therefore 
charity is recommended to be given at a place of pilgrimage and at lunar or 
solar eclipses or at the end of the month or to a qualified briihmap,a or a 
V ai�l).ava (devotee) or in temples. Such charities should be given without 
any consideration of return. Charity to the poor is sometimes given out of 
compassion, but if a poor man is not worth giving charity to, then there is 
no spiritual advancement. In other words, indiscriminate charity is not 
recommended in the Vedic literature.

PURPORT 
Charity is sometimes performed for elevation to the heavenly kingdom 
and sometimes with great trouble and with repentance afterwards. "Why 
have I spent so much in this way?" Charity is also sometimes made under 
some obligation, at the request of a superior. These kinds of charity are 
said to be made in the mode of passion. 
There are many charitable foundations which offer their gifts to 
institutions where sense gratification goes on. Such charities are not

TRANSLATION 
From the beginning of creation, the three syllables-om tat sat-have 
been used to indicate the Supreme Absolute Truth [Brahman]. They were 
uttered by brahmapas while chanting Vedic hymns and during sacrifices, 
for the satisfaction of the Supreme. 
PURPORT 
It has been explained that penance, sacrifice, charity and foods are 
divided into three categories: 
the modes of goodness, passion and 
ignorance. But whether first class, second class or third class, they are all 
conditioned, contaminated by the material modes of nature. When they are 
aimed at the Supreme-om tat sat, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, 
the eternal-they become means for spiritual elevation. In the scriptural 
injunctions such an objective is indicated. These three words, om tat sat, 
particularly indicate the Absolute Truth, the Supreme Personality of 
Godhead. In the Vedic hymns, the word om is always found. 
One who acts without following the regulations of the scriptures will 
not attain the Absolute Truth. He will get some temporary result, but not 
the ultimate end of life. The conclusion is that the performance of 
charities, sacrifice and penance must be done in the mode of goodness. 
Performed in the modes of passion or ignorance, they are certainly 
inferior in quality. The three words om tat sat are uttered in conjunction 
with the holy name of the Supreme Lord, e.g., om tad vi§ro�. Whenever a 
Vedic hymn or the holy name of the Supreme Lord is uttered, om is 
added. This is the indication of Vedic. literature. These three words are 
taken from Vedic hymns. Om ity etad brahmar;to nedi§!am niima indicates 
. ' 
Text 24 J

773 
the first goal. Then tattvamasi indicates the second goal. And sad eva 
saumya indicates the third goal. Combined they become om tat sat. 
Formerly when Brahma, the first created living entity, performed sacrifices, 
he spoke these three names of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. The 
same principle holds by disciplic succession. So this hymn has great 
significance. Bhagavad-gitii recommends, therefore, that any work done 
should be done for om tat sat, or for the Supreme Personality of Godhead. 
When one performs penance, charity, and sacrifice with these three words, 
he is acting in Kr�pa consciousness. Kr�pa consciousness is a scientific 
execution of transcendental activities which enables one to return home, 
back to Godhead. There is no loss of energy in acting in such a transcen­
dental way.

TRANSLATION 
The Absolute Truth is the objective of devotional sacrifice, and it is 
indicated by the word sat. These works of sacrifice, of penance and of 
charity, true to the absolute nature, are performed to please the Supreme 
Person, 0 son of Pfihii. 
PURPORT 
The words praSaste karmari, or prescribed duties, indicate that there are 
many activities prescribed in the Vedic literature which are purificatory 
processes beginning from parental care up to the end of one's life. Such 
purificatory processes are adopted for the ultimate liberation of the living 
entity. In all such activities it is recommended that one should vibrate om 
tat sat. The words sad-bhiive and siidhu-bhiive indicate the transcendental 
situation. One who is acting in Kr�pa consciousness is called sattva, and one 
who is fully conscious of activities in Kr�pa consciousness is called 
svariipa. In the Srimad-Bhiigavatam it is said that the transcendental 
subject matter becomes clear in the association of the devotees. Without 
good association, one cannot achieve transcendental knowledge. When 
initiating a person or offering the sacred thread, one vibrates the words om 
tat sat. Similarly, in all kinds of yogic performances, the supreme object, 
om tat sat is invoked. These words om tat sat are used to perfect all 
activities. This supreme om tat sat makes everything complete.

TRANSLATION 
But sacrifices, austerities and charities performed without faith in the 
Supreme are nonpermanent, 0 son of Prtha, regardless of whatever rites 
are performed. They are called asat and are useless both in this life and the 
next. 
PURPORT 
Anything done without the transcendental objective-whether it be 
sacrifice, charity or penance -is useless. Therefore, in this verse, it is 
declared that such activities are abominable. Everything should be done 
for the Supreme in Kr�pa consciousness. Without such faith, and without 
the proper guidance, there can never be any fruit. In all the Vedic 
scriptures, faith in the Supreme is advised. In the pursuit of all Vedic 
instructions, the ultimate goal is the understanding of K�pa. No one can 
obtain success without following this principle. Therefore, the best course 
is to work from the very beginning in Kr�pa consciousness under the 
guidance of a bona fide spiritual master. That is the way to make 
everything successful. 
In the conditional state, people are attracted to worship demi�ods, 
ghosts, or Yak�as like Kuvera. The mode of goodness is better than the 
modes of passion and ignorance, but one who takes directly to Kr�pa 
consciousness is transcendental to all three modes of material nature. 
Although there is a process of gradual elevation, if one, by the association

of pure devotees, takes directly to Kr�pa consciousness, that is the best 
way. And that is recommended in this chapter. To achieve success in this: 
way, one must first find the proper spiritual master and receive training 
under his direction. Then one can achieve faith in the Supreme. When that 
faith matures, in course of time, it is called love of God. This love is the 
ultimate goal of the living entities. One should, therefore, take to Kr�pa 
consciousness directly. That is the message of tltls Seventeenth Chapter. 
Thus end the Bhaktivedanta Purports to the Seventeenth Chapter of the 
Srimad-Bhagavad-gita in the matter of the Divisions of Faith.

PURPORT 
Actually the Bhagavad-gitii is finished in seventeen chapters. The Eight­
eenth Chapter is a supplementary summarization of the topics discussed 
before. In every chapter of Bhagavad-gitii, Lord KrllJJ.a stresses that devo­
tional service unto the Supreme Personality of Godhead is the ultimate 
goal of life. This same point is summarized in the Eighteenth Chapter as 
the most confidential path of knowledge. In the first six chapters, stress 
was given to devotional service: yoginiim api saroe§iim ... "Of all yogis or 
transcendentalists, one who always thinks of Me within himself is best." In 
the next six chapters, pure devotional service and its nature and activity 
were discussed. In the third six chapters, knowledge, renunciation, the 
activities of material nature and transcendental nature, and devotional 
service were described. It was concluded that all acts should be performed 
· in conjunction with the Supreme Lord, summarized by the words om tat sat, 
which indicate Vi�J).U, the Supreme Person. In the third part of Bhagavad­
gitii, devotional service was established by the example of past iiciiryas 
and the Brahma-siltra, the Vediinta-siltra, which cites that devotional 
service is the ultimate purpose of life and nothing else. Certain impersonal­
isis consider themselves monopolizers of the knowledge of Vediinta-sutra, 
but actually the Vediinta-siltra is meant for understanding devotional ser­
vice, for the Lord Himself is the composer of the Vediinta-siltra, and He is 
its knower. That is described in the Fifteenth Chapter. In every scripture, 
every Veda, devotional service is the objective. That is explained in 
Bhagavad-gitii. 
As in the Second Chapter a synopsis of the whole subject matter was 
described, similarly, in the Eighteenth Chapter also the summary of all 
instruction is given. The purpose of life is indicated to be renunciation and 
attainment of the transcendental position above the three material modes 
of nature. Aijuna wants to clarify the two distinct subject matters of 
Bhagavad-gitii, namely renunciation (tyiiga) and the renounced order of 
life (sannyiisa). Thus he is asking the meaning of these two words. 
Two words used in this verse to address the Supreme Lord-Hr�ikesa 
and Kesinisudana-are significant. Hr�kesa is Kr�JJ.a, the master of .all

senses, who can always help us attain mental serenity. A�una requests 
Him to summarize everything in such a way that he can remain equiposed. 
Yet he has some doubts, and doubts are always compared to demons. He 
therefore addresses Krwa as Ke8inisudana. KeSi: was a most formidable 
demon who was killed by the Lord; now A�una is expecting Kr�va to kill 
the demon of doubt.

The Supreme Lord said, To give up the results of all activities is called 
renunciation [ tyaga] by the wise. And that state is called the renounced

PURPORT 
The performance of activities for results has to be given up. This is the 
instruction of Bhagavad-gitii. But activities leading to advanced spiritual 
knowledge are not to be given up. This will he made clear in the next verse. 
There are many prescriptions of methods for performing sacrifice for some 
particular purpose in the Vedic literatures. There are certain sacrifices to 
I 
782

[Ch. 18 
perform to attain a good son or to attain elevation to the higher planets, 
but sacrifices prompted by desires should be stopped. However, sacrifice 
for the purification of one's heart or for advancement in the spiritual sci­
ence should not be given up.

TRANSLATION 
Some learned men declare that all kinds of fruitive activities should be 
given up, but there are yet other sages who maintain that acts of sacrifice, 
charity and penance should never be abandoned. 
PURPORT 
There are many activities in the Vedic literatures which are subjects of 
contention. For instance, it is said that an animal can be killed in a sacri­
fice, yet some maintain animal killing is completely abominable. Although 
animal killing in a sacrifice is recommended in the Vedic literature, the 
animal is not considered to be killed. The sacrifice is to give a new life to 
the animaL Sometimes the animal is given a new animal life after being 
killed in the sacrifice, and sometimes the animal is promoted immediately 
to the human form of life. But there are different opinions among the 
sages. Some say that animal killing should always be avoided, and others 
say that for a specific sacrifice it is good. All these different opinions on 
sacrificial activity are now being clarified by the Lord Himself.

TRANSLATION 
0 best of the Bharatas, hear from Me now about renunciation. 0 tiger 
among men, there are three kinds of renunciation declared in the scrip­
tures. 
PURPORT 
Although there are differences of opinion about renunciation, here the 
Supreme Personality of Godhead, Sri Kr�l)a, gives His judgment, which 
should be taken as final. After all, the Vedas are different laws given by the 
Lord. Here the Lord is personally present, and His word should be taken 
as final. The Lord says that the process of renunciation should be consid­
ered in terms of the modes of material nature in which they are performed.

TRANSLATION 
Acts of sacrifice, charity and penance are not to be given up but should 
be performed. Indeed, sacrifice, charity and penance purify even the great 
souls. 
PURPORT 
The yogis should perform acts for the advancement of human society. 
There are many purificatory processes for advancing a human being to 
spiritual life. The marriage ceremony, for example, is considered to be one 
of these sacrifices. It is called vivaha-yajiia. Should a sannyasi, who is in the 
renounced order of life and who has given up his family relations, encour­
age the marriage ceremony? The Lord says here that any sacrifice which is 
meant for human welfare should never be given up. Vivaha-yajiia, the 
marriage ceremony, is meant to regulate the human mind to become peace­
ful for spiritual advancement. For most men, this vivaha-yajiia should be 
encouraged even by persons in the renounced order of life. Sannyasis 
should never associate with women, but that does not mean that one who 
is in the lower stages of life, a young man, should not accept a wife in the 
marriage ceremony. All prescribed sacrifices are meant for: achieving the 
Supreme Lord. Therefore, in the lower stages, they should not be given up. 
Similarly, charity is for the purification of the heart. If charity is given to 
suitable persons, as described previously, it leads one to advanced spiritual 
life.

TRANSLATION 
All these activities should be performed without any expectation of 
result. They should be performed as a matter of duty, 0 son of Prtha. That 
is My final opinion. 
PURPORT 
Although all sacrifices are purifying, one should not expect any result 
by such performances. In other words, all sacrifices which are meant for 
material advancement in life should be given up, but sacrifices that purify 
one's existence and elevate one to the spiritual plane should not be stopped. 
Everything that leads to Kr�l!a consciousness must be encouraged. In 
the Snmad-Bhiigavatam also it is said that any activity which leads to 
devotional service to the Lord should be accepted. That is the highest 
criterion of religion. A devotee of the Lord should accept any kind of 
work, sacrifice, or charity which will help him in the discharge of devo­
tional service to the Lord.

Prescribed duties should never be renounced. If, by illusion, one gives 
up his prescribed duties, such renunciation is said to be in the mode of 
ignorance. 
PURPORT 
Work for material satisfaction must be given up, but activities which 
promote one to spiritual activity, like cooking for the Supreme Lord and 
offering the food to the Lord and then accepting the food, are recommend­
ed. It is said that a person in the renounced order of life should not cook 
for himself. Cooking for oneself is prohibited, but cooking for the Supreme 
Lord is not prohibited. Similarly, a sannyiisi may perform a marriage 
ceremony to help his disciple in the advancement of Kr�IJ.a consciousness. 
If one renounces such activities, it is to be understood that he is acting in 
the mode of darkness.

Conclusion-The Perfection of Renunciation 
787 
PURPORT 
One who is in Kr�Qa consciousness should not give up earning money 
out of fear that he is performing fruitive activities. If by working one can 
engage his money in Kr�Qa consciousness, or if by rising early in the morn­
ing one can advance his transcendental Kr�Qa consciousness, one should 
not desist out of fear or because such activities are considered trouble­
some. Such renunciation is in the mode of passion. The result of passionate 
work is always miserable. Even if a person renounces work in that spirit, 
he never gets the result of renunciation.

But he who performs his prescribed duty only because it ought to be

PURPORT 
Prescribed duties must be performed with this mentality. One should 
act without attachment for the result; he should be disassociated from the 
modes of work. A man working in Kr�Qa consciousness in a factory does 
not associate himself with the work of the factory, nor with the workers 
788 
Bhagavad-gita As It Is 
[Ch. 18 
of the factory. He simply works for Krgta. And when he gives up the result 
for Kr�va, he is acting transcendentally.

PURPORT 
It is said in Bhagavad-gitii that one can never give up work at any time. 
Therefore he who works for Kr�va and does not enjoy the fruitive results, 
who offers everything to Kr�va, is actually a renouncer. There are many 
members of the International Society for Krishna Consciousness who work 
very hard in their office or in the factory or some other place, and what­
ever they earn they give to the Society. Such highly elevated souls are 
actually sannyiisis and are situated in the renounced order of life. It is 
clearly outlined here how to renounce the fruits of work and for what 
purpose fruits should be renounced.

philosophy to be the place of action, the performer, the senses, the 
endeavor, and ultimately the Supersoul. 
PURPORT 
A question may be raised that since any activity performed must have 
some reaction, how is it that the person in Kr�JJ.a consciousness does not 
suffer or enjoy the reactions of work? The Lord is citing Vedanta philoso­
phy to show how this is possible. He says that there are five causes for all 
activities and for success in all activity, and one should know these five 
causes. Sahkhya means the stalk of knowledge, and Vedanta is the final 
stalk of knowledge accepted by all leading iiciiryas. Even Satikara accepts 
Ve'diinta-siitra as such. Therefore such authority should be cons.ulted. 
The ultimate will is invested in the Supersoul, as it is stated in the Gitii, 
"saroasya ciiharh hrdi." He is engaging everyone in certain activities. Acts 
done under His direction from within yield no reaction, either in this life 
or in the life after death. 
The instruments of action are the senses, and by senses the soul acts 
in various ways, and for each and every action there is a different endeavor. 
But all one's activities depend on the will of the Supersoul, who is seated 
within the heart as a friend. The Supreme Lord is the super cause. Under 
these circumstances, he who is acting in Kr�lJ.a consciousness under the 
direction of the Supersoul situated within the heart is naturally not bound 
by any activity. Those in complete Kr�lJ.a consciousness are not ultimately 
responsible for their actions. Everything is dependent on the supreme will, 
the Supersoul, the Supreme Personality of Godhead.

TRANSLATION 
Whatever right or wrong action a man performs by body, mind or 
speech is caused by these five factors. 
PURPORT 
The words "right" and "wrong" are very significant in this verse. Right 
work is work done in terms of the prescribed directions in the scriptures, 
and wrong work is work done against the principles of the scriptural 
injunctions. But whatever is done requires these five factors for its com­
plete performance.

Therefore one who thinks himself the only doer, not considering the

PURPORT 
A foolish person cannot understand that the Supersoul is sitting as a 
friend within and conducting his actions. Although the material causes are 
the place, the worker, the endeavor and the senses, the final cause is the 
Supreme, the Personality of Godhead. Therefore, one should see not only

TRANSLATION 
One who is not motivated by false ego, whose intelligence is not entan­

by his actions. 
PUR)_)ORT 
In this verse the Lord informs Arjuna that the desire not to fight arises 
from false ego. Arjuna thought himself to be the doer of action, but he did 
not consider the Supreme sanction within and without. If one does not 
know that a super sanction is there, why should he act? But one who 
knows the instrument of work, himself as the worker, and the Supreme 
Lord as the supreme sanctioner, is perfect in doing everything. Such a 
person is never in illusion. Personal activity and responsibility arise from 
false ego and godlessness, or a lack of Kn;J).a consciousness. Anyone who is 
acting in Kr�J).a consciousness under the direction of the Supersoul or the 
Supreme Personality of Godhead, even though killing, ,does not kill. Nor is 
he ever affected with the reaction of such killing. When a soldier kills under 
the command of a superior officer, he is not subject to be judged. But if a 
soldier kills on his own personal account, then he is certainly judged by a 
court of law.

TRANSLATION 
Knowledge, the object of knowledge and the knower are the three 
factors which motivate action; the senses, the work and the doer comprise 
the threefold basis of action. 
There are three kinds of impetus for daily work: knowledge, the object 
of knowledge and the knower. The instruments of work, the work itself 
and the worker are called the constituents of work. Any work done by any 
human being has these elements. Before one acts, there is some impetus, 
which is called inspiration. Any solution arrived at before work is actual­
ized is a subtle form of work. Then work takes the form of action. First one 
has to undergo the psychological processes of thinking, feeling and willing, 
and that is called impetus. Actually the faith to perform acts is called 
knowledge. The inspiration to work is the same if it comes from the scrip­
ture or from the instruction of the spiritual master. When the inspiration 
is there and the worker is there, then actual activity takes place by the 
help of the senses. The mind is the center of all senses, and the object is 
work itself. These are the different phases of work as described in 
Bhagavad-gitii. The sum total of all activities is called accumulation of 
work.

In accordance with the three modes .of material nature, there are three

PURPORT 
In the Fourteenth Chapter the three divisions of the modes of material 
nature were elaborately described. In that chapter it was said that the 
mode of goodness is illuminating, the mode of passion materialistic, and 
the mode of ignorance conducive to laziness and indolence. All the modes 
of material nature are binding; they are not sources of liberation. Even in 
the mode of goodness one is conditioned. In the Seventeenth Chapter, the 
different types of worship by different types of men in different modes of 
material nature were described. In this verse, the Lord wishes to speak 
about the different types of knowledge, workers, and work itself according 
to the three material modes.

That knowledge by which one undivided spiritual nature is seen in all

PURPORT 
A person who sees one spirit soul in every living being, whether a demi­
god, human being, animal, bird, beast, aquatic or plant, possesses know­
ledge in the mode of goodness. In all living entities, one spirit soul is there, 
although they have different bodies in terms of their previous work. As 
described in the Seventh Chapter, the manifestation of the living force in 
every body is due to the superior nature of the Supreme Lord. Thus to see 
that one superior nature, that living force, in every body is to see in the 
mode of goodness. That living energy is imperishable, although the bodies 
are perishable. The difference is perceived in terms of the body because 
there are many forms of material existence in conditional life; therefore 
they appear to be divided. Such impersonal knowledge finally leads to 
self-realization.

797· 
That knowledge by which a different type of living entity is seen to be 
dwelling in different bodies is knowledge in the mode of passion. 
PURPORT 
The concept that the material body is the living entity and that with 
the destruction of the body the consciousness is also destroyed is called 
knowledge in the mode of passion. According to that knowledge, bodies 
differ from one another because of the development of different types of 
consciousness, otherwise there is no separate soul which manifests con­
sciousness. The body is itself the soul, and there is no separate soul beyond 
this body. According to such knowledge, consciousness is temporary. Or 
else there are no individual souls, but there is an all-pervading soul, which 
is full of knowledge, and this body is a manifestation of temporary igno­
rance. Or beyond this body there is no special individual or Supreme Soul. 
All such conceptions are considered products of the mode of passion.

mode of ignorance. One who does not develop knowledge through the 
authorities or scriptural injunctions has knowledge that is limited to the 
body. He is not concerned about acting in terms of the directions of scrip­
ture. For him God is money, and knowledge means the satisfaction of 
bodily demands. Such knowledge has no connection with the Absolute 
Truth. It is more or less like the knowledge of the ordinary animals: the 
knowledge of eating, sleeping, defending and mating. Such knowledge is 
described here as the product of the mode of darkness. In other words, 
knowledge concerning the spirit soul beyond this body is called know­
ledge in the mode of goodness, and knowledge producing many theories 
and doctrines by dint of mundane logic and mental speculation is the 
product of the mode of passion, and knowledge concerned with only keep­
ing the body comfortable is said to be in the mode of ignorance.

Regulated occupational duties, as prescribed in the scriptures in terms 
of the different orders and divisions of society, performed without attach­
ment or proprietary rights and therefore without any love or hatred and 
performed in Kr�J}a consciousness for the satisfaction of the Supreme, 
without self-satisfaction or self-gratification, are called actions in the mode

PURPORT 
One has to give account of one's actions to the state or to the agents of 
the Supreme Lord called the Y amadutas. Irresponsible work is distraction 
because it destroys the regulative principles of scriptural injunction. It is 
often based on violence and is distressing to other living entities. Such 
irresponsible work is carried out in the light of one's personal experience. 
This is called illusion. And all such illusory work is a product of the mode 
of ignorance.

PURPORT 
A person in Kr�l)a consciousness is always transcendental to the materi­
al modes of nature. He has no expectations for the result of the work 
entrusted to him because he is above false ego and pride. Still, he is always 
enthusiastic till the completion of such work. He does not worry about 
the distress undertaken; he is always enthusiastic. He does not care for 
success or failure; he is equal both in distress or happiness. Such a worker 
is situated in the mode of goodness.

But that worker who is attached to the fruits of his labor and who 
passionately wants to enjoy them, who is greedy, envious and impure and 
moved by happiness and distress, is a worker in the mode of passion. 
PURPORT 
A person is too much attached to certain kind of work or to the result 
because he has too much attachment for materialism or hearth and home, 
wife and children. Such a person has no desire for higher elevation of life. 
He is simply concerned with making this world as materially comfortable 
as possible. He is generally very greedy, and he thinks that anything at­
tained by him is permanent and never to be lost. Such a person is envious of

others and prepared to do anything wrong for sense gratification. Therefore 
such a person is unclean, and he does not care whether his earning is pure 
or impure. He is very happy if his work is successful and very much 
distressed when his work is not successful. Such is a man in the mode of 
passion.

worker in the mode of ignorance. 
PURPORT 
In the scriptural injunctions we find what sort of work should be per­
formed and what sort of work should not be performed. Those who do 
not care for those injunctions engage in work not to be done, and such 
persons are generally materialistic. They work according to the modes of 
nature, not according to the injunctions of the scripture. Such workers are 
not very gentle, and generally they are always cunning and expert in insult­
ing others. They are very lazy; even though they have some duty, they do 
not do it properly, and they put it aside to be done later on. Therefore

in an hour they drag on for years. Such workers are situated in the mode 
of ignorance.

Actions which are performed in terms of the directions of the scriptures 
are called pravrtti, or actions that deserve to be performed, and actions 
which are not so directed are not to be performed. One who does not 
know the scriptural directions becomes entangled in the actions and reac­
tions of work. Understanding which discriminates by intelligence is situ­
ated in the mode of goodness.

And that understanding which cannot distinguish between the religious

action that should not be done, that imperfect understanding, 0 son of 
Prtha, is in the mode of passion. 
PURPORT 
Intelligence in the mode of passion is always working perversely. It 
accepts religions which are not actually religions and rejects actual religion. 
All views and activities are misguided. Men of passionate intelligence under­
stand a great soul to be a common man and accept a common man as a 
great soul. They think truth to be untruth and accept untruth as truth. In 
all activities they simply take the wrong path; therefore their intelligence 
is in the mode of passion.

Yoga is a means to understand the Supreme Soul. One who is steadily 
fixed in the Supreme Soul with determination, concentrating one's mind, 
life and sensual activities on the Supreme, engages in Kr�l).a consciousness. 
That sort of determination is in the mode of goodness. The word 
avyabhiciirirya is very significant, for it refers to persons who are engaged 
in Kr�l).a consciousness and are never deviated by any other activity.

It should not be concluded that a person in the mode of goodness does

either in the mode of goodness, passion or ignorance, dream is a natural 
occurrence. But those who cannot avoid oversleeping, who cannot avoid 
the pride of enjoying material objects and who are always dreaming of 
lording it over the material world, whose life, mind, and senses are thus 
engaged, are considered to be in the mode of ignorance.

times comes to the end of all distress. That which in the beginning may be 
just like poison but at the end is just like nectar and which awakens one to 
self-realization is said to be happiness in the mode of goodness. 
PURPORT 
A conditioned soul tries to enjoy material happiness again and again. 
Thus he chews the chewed, but, sometimes, in the course of such enjoy­
ment, he becomes relieved from material entanglement by association with 
a great soul. In other words, a conditioned soul is always engaged in some 
type of sense gratification, but when he understands by good association 
that it is only a repetition of the same thing, and he is awakened to his real 
Kw;ta consciousness, he is sometimes relieved from such repetitive so-called 
happiness. 
In the pursuit of self-reaiization, one has to follow many rules and regu­
lations to control the mind and the senses and to concentrate the mind on 
the Self. All these procedures are very difficult, bitter like poison, but if 
one is successful in following the regulations and comes to the transcen­
dental position, he begins to drink real nectar, and he enjoys life.

Bhagavad-glta As It Is 
[Ch. 18 
PURPORT 
A young man and a young woman meet, and the senses drive the young 
man to see her, to touch her and to have sexual intercourse. In the begin­
ning this may be very pleasing to the senses, but at the end, or after some 
time, it becomes just like poison. They are separated or there is divorce, 
there is lamentation, there is sorrow, etc. Such happiness is always in the 
mode of passion. Happiness derived from a combination of the senses and 
the sense objects is always a cause of distress and should be avoided by all 
means.

By worship of the Lord, who is the source of all beings and who is all­

PURPORT 
As stated in the Fifteenth Chapter, all living beings are fragmental parts 
and parcels of the Supreme Lord. As such, the Supreme Lord is the 
beginning of all living entities. This is confirmed in the Vediinta-siltra­
janmiidy asya yata�. The Supreme Lord is therefore the beginning of life 
of every living entity. And the Supreme Lord, by His two energies, His 
external energy and internal energy, is all-pervading. Therefore one should 
worship the Supreme Lord with His energies. Generally the V ai�Qava 
Text 47) 
Conclusion-The Perfection of Renunciation 
815 
devotees worship the Supreme Lord with His internal energy. His external 
energy is a perverted reflection of the internal energy. The external energy 
is a background, but the Supreme Lord by the expansion of His plenary 
portion as Paramatma is situated everywhere. He is the Supersoul of all 
demigods, all human beings, all animals, everywhere. One should therefore 
know that as part and parcel of the Supreme Lord it is his duty to render 
service unto the Supreme. Everyone should be engaged in devotional 
service to the Lord in full Kr�JJ.a consciousness. That is recommended in 
this verse. 
Everyone should think that he is engaged in a particular type of occupa­
tion by Hr�Ikesa, the master of the senses. And, by the result of the work 
in which one is engaged, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Sri Kr�JJ.a, 
should be worshiped. If one thinks always in this way, in full Kr�IJ.a con­
sciousness, then, by the grace of the Lord, he becomes fully aware of 
everything. That is the perfection of life. The Lord says in Bhagavad-gita, 
te�am aharh samuddharta. The Supreme Lord Himself takes charge of 
delivering such a devotee. That is the highest perfection of life. In what­
ever occupation one may be engaged, if he serves the Supreme Lord, he 
will achieve the highest perfection.

it perfectly. Prescribed duties, according to one's nature, are never affected 
by sinful reactions. 
PURPORT 
One's occupational duty is prescribed in Bhagavad-gitii. As already dis­
cussed in previous verses, the duties of a briihmar-a, k§atriya, vaisya and 
sudra are prescribed according to the particular modes of nature. One 
should not imitate another's duty. A man who is by nature attracted to 
the kind of work done by sudras should not artificially claim himself to be 
a briihmar-a, although he may be born into a briihmar-a family. In this way 
one should work according to his own nature; no work is abominable, if 
performed in the service of the Supreme Lord. The occupational duty of a 
briihmar-a is certainly in the mode of goodness, but if a person is not by 
nature in the mode of goodness, he should not imitate the occupational 
duty of a briihmar-a. For a k§atriya, or administrator, there are so many 
abominable things; a k§atriya has to be violent to kill his enemies, and 
sometimes a k§atriya has to tell lies for the sake of diplomacy. Such vio­
lence and duplicity accompany political affairs, but a k§atriya is not sup­
/posed to give up his occupational duty and try to perform the duties of a 
b riihmar-a. 
One should act to satisfy the Supreme Lord. For example, Arjuna was a 
k§atriya. He was hesitating to fight the other party. But if such fighting is 
performed for the sake of Kr�IJ.a, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, 
there need be no fear of degradation. In the business field also, sometimes 
a merchant has to tell so many lies to make a profit. If he does not do so, 
there can be no profit. Sometimes a merchant says, "Oh, my dear custom­
er, for you I am making no profit," but one should know that without 
profit the merchant cannot exist. Therefore it should be taken as a simple 
lie if a merchant says that he is not making a profit. But the merchant 
should not think that because he is engaged in an occupation in which the 
telling of lies is compulsory, he should give up his profession and pursue 
the profession of a briihmar-a. That is not recommended. Whether one is a 
k§atriya, a vaisya, or a sudra doesn't matter, if he serves, by his work, the 
Supreme Personality of Godhead. Even briihmar-as, who perform different 
types of sacrifice, sometimes must kill animals because sometimes animals 
are sacrificed in such ceremonies. Similarly, if a k§atriya engaged in his 
own occupation kills an enemy, there is no sin incurred. In the Third 
Chapter these matters have been clearly and elaborately explained; every 
man should work for the purpose of yajiia, or for Vi�I).U, the Supreme

Personality of Godhead. Anything done for personal sense gratification is 
a cause of bondage. The conclusion is that everyone should be engaged 
according to the particular mode of nature he has acquired, and he should 
decide to work only to serve the supreme cause of the Supreme Lord.

TRANSLATION 
Every endeavor is covered by some sort of fault, just as fire is covered 
by smoke. Therefore one should not give up the work which is born of his 
nature, 0 son of Kunti, even if such work is full of fault. 
PURPORT 
In conditioned life, all work is contaminated by the material modes of 
nature. Even if one is a briihmar-a, he has to perform sacrifices in which 
animal killing is necessary. Similarly, a k§atriya, however pious he may be, 
has to fight enemies. He cannot avoid it. Similarly, a merchant, however 
pious he may be, must sometimes hide his profit to stay in business, or he 
may sometimes have to do business on the black market. These things are 
necessary; one cannot avoid them. Similarly, even though a man is a sudra 
serving a bad master, he has to carry out the order of the master, even 
though it should not be done. Despite these flaws, one should continue to 
carry out his prescribed duties, for they are born out of.his own nature. 
818 
Bhagavad-glta As It Is 
[Ch. 18 
. 
A very nice example is given herein. Although fire is pure, still there is 
smoke. Yet smoke does not make the fire impure. Even though there is 
smoke in the fire, fire is still considered to be the purest of all elements. If 
one prefers to give up the work of a k§atriya and take up the occupation 
of a briihmar-a, he is not assured that in the occupation of a briihmar-a 
there are no unpleasant duties. One may then conclude that in the material 
world no one can be completely free from the contamination of material 
nature. This example of fire and smoke is very appropriate in this connec­
tion. When in wintertime one takes a stone from the fire, sometimes 
smoke disturbs the eyes and other parts of the body, but still one must 
make use of the fire despite disturbing conditions. Similarly, one should 
not give up his natural occupation because there are some disturbing 
elements. Rather, one should be determined to serve the Supreme Lord by 
his occupational duty in Kr�1;1a consciousness. That is the perfectional 
point. When a particular type of occupation is performed for the satisfac­
tion of the Supreme Lord, all the defects in that particular occupation are 
purified. When the results of work are purified, when connected with 
devotional service, one becomes perfect in seeing the self within, and that 
is self-realization.

Conclusion-The Perfection of Renunciation 
819 
PURPORT 
Real renunciation means that one should always think himself part and 
parcel of the Supreme Lord. Therefore he has no right to enjoy the results 
of his work. Since he is part and parcel of the Supreme Lord, the results of 
his work must be enjoyed by the Supreme Lord. This is actually Kr�I,la 
consciousness. The person acting in Kr�I,la consciousness is really a sannyiis� 
one in the renounced order of life. By such mentality, one is satisfied be­
cause he is actually acting for the Supreme. Thus he is not attached to 
anything material; he becomes accustomed to not taking pleasure in any­
thing beyond the transcendental happiness derived from the service of the 
Lord. A sannyiisi is supposed to be free from the reactions of his past 
activities, but a person who is in Kr�IJa consciousness automatically attains 
this perfection without even accepting the so-called order of renunciation. 
This state of mind is called yogiiriiflha, or the perfectional stage of yoga, 
as confirmed in the Third Chapter: yas tv iitma-ratir eva syiit. One who is 
satisfied in himself has no fear of any kind of reaction from his activity.

that duty for the Supreme Personality of Godhead. One attains the su­
preme stage of Brahman simply by renouncing the result of his work for 
the satisfaction of the Supreme Lord. That is the process of self-realization. 
Actual perfection of knowledge is in attaining pure Kr�J).a consciousness; 
that is described in the following verses.

TRANSLATION 
Being purified by his intelligence and c�mtrolling the mind with deter­
mination, giving up the objects of sense gratification, being freed from 
attachment and hatred, one who lives in a secluded place, who eats little 
and who controls the body and the tongue, and is always in trance and is 
detached, who is without false ego, false strength, false pride, lust, anger, 
and who does not accept material things, such a person is certainly elevat­
ed to the position of self-realization. 
PURPORT 
When one is purified by knowledge, he keeps himself in the mode of 
goodness. Thus one becomes the controller of the mind and is always in 
trance. Because he is not attached to the objects of sense gratification, he 
does not eat more than what he requires, and he controls the activities of 
his body and mind. He has no false ego because he does not accept the 
body as himself. Nor has he a desire to make the body fat and strong by 
accepting so many material things. Because he has no bodily concept of 
life, he is not falsely proud. He is satisfied with everything that is offered 
to him by the grace of the Lord, and he is never angry in the absence of 
sense gratification. Nor does he endeavor to acquire sense objects. Thus 
when he is completely free from false ego, he becomes nonattached to all 
material things, and that is the stage of self-realization of Brahman. That 
stage is called the brahma-bhuta stage. When one is free from the material 
conception of life, he becomes peaceful and cannot be agitated.

TRANSLATION 
One who is thus transcendentally situated at once realizes the Supreme 
Brahman. He never laments nor desires to have anything; he is equally 
disposed to every living entity. In that state he attains pure devotional 
service unto Me. 
PURPORT 
To the impersonalist, achieving the brahma-bhiita stage, becoming one 
, with the Absolute, is the last word. But for the personalist, or pure devo­
tee, one has to go still further to become engaged in pure devotional 
service. This means that one who is engaged in pure devotional service to 
the Supreme Lord is already in a state of liberation, called brahma-bhiita, 
oneness with the Absolute. Without being one with the Supreme, the 
Absolute, one cannot render service unto Him. In the absolute conception, 
there is no difference between the served and the servitor; yet the distinc­
tion is there, in a higher spiritual sense. 
In the material concept of life, when one works for sense gratification, 
there is misery, but in the absolute world, when one is engaged in pure 
devotional service, there is no misery. The devotee in Kr�l}a consciousness 
has nothing to lament or desire. Since God is full, a living entity who is 
engaged in God's service, in Kr�l}a consciousness, becomes also full in 
himself. He is just like a river cleansed of all dirty water. Because a pure 
devotee has no thought other than Kr�I}a, he is naturally always joy­
ful. He doe<; not lament for any material loss or gain because he is full in 
service of the Lord. He has no desire for material enjoyment because he 
knows that every living entity is the fragmental part and parcel of the 
Supreme Lord and therefore eternally a servant. He does not see, in the 
material world, someone as higher and someone as lower; higher and lower 
positions are ephemeral, and a devotee has nothing to do with ephemeral 
appearances or disappearances. For him stone and gold are of equal value. 
This is the brahma-bhiita stage, and this stage is attained very easily by the 
pure devotee. In that stage of existence, the idea of becoming one with 
the Supreme Brahman and annihilating one's individuality becomes hellish, 
Text 55] 
Conclusion-The Perfection of Renunciation 
823 
and the idea of attaining the heavenly kingdom becomes phantasmagoria, 
and the senses are like broken serpents' teeth. As there is no fear of a 
serpent with broken teeth, so there is no fear from the senses when they 
are automatically controlled. The world is miserable for the materially 
infected person, but for a devotee the entire world is as good as V aikuJ).tha, 
or the spiritual sky. The highest personality in this material universe is no 
more significant than an ant for a devotee. Such a stage can be achieved by 
the mercy of Lord Caitanya, who preached pure devotional service in this 
age.

One can understand the Supreme Personality as He is only by devotion­

such devotion, he can enter into the kingdom of God. 
PURPORT 
The Supreme Personality of Godhead, Kr�J).a, and His plenary portions 
cannot be understood by mental speculation nor by the nondevotees. If 
anyone wants to understand the Supreme Personality of Godhead, he has 
to take to pure devotional service under the guidance of a pure devotee. 
Otherwise, the truth of the Supreme Personality of Godhead will always 
be hidden. It is already stated (niiharh prakiisa[l) that He is not revealed to 
everyone. Everyone cannot understand God simply by erudite scholarship 
824 
Bhagavad-gita As It Is 
[Ch. 18 
or mental speculation. Only one who is actually engaged in Kr�l).a con­
sciousness and devotional service can understand what Kr�l).a is. University 
degrees are not helpful. 
One who is fully conversant with the Kr�l).a science becomes eligible to 
enter into the spiritual kingdom, the abode of Kr�l).a. Becoming Brahman 
does not mean that one loses his identity. Devotional service is there, and 
as long as devotional service exists, there must be God, the devotee, and 
the process of devotional service. Such knowledge is never vanquished, 
even after liberation. Liberation involves getting free from the concept of 
material life; in spiritual life the same distinction is there, the same indi­
viduality is there, hut in pure Kr�l).a consciousness. One should not mis­
understand that the word visate, "enters into Me," supports the monist 
theory that one becomes homogeneous with the impersonal Brahman. No. 
Visate means that one can enter into the abode of the Supreme Lord in his 
individuality to engage in His association and render service unto Him. For 
instance, a green bird enters a green tree not to become one with the tree 
but to enjoy the fruits of the tree. lmpersonalists generally give the exam­
ple of a river flowing into the ocean and merging. This may be a source of 
happiness for the impersonalist, but the personalist keeps his personal 
individuality like an aquatic in the ocean. We find so many living entities 
within the ocean, if we go deep. Surface acquaintance with the ocean is 
not sufficient; one must have complete knowledge of the aquatics living 
in the ocean depths. 
Because of his pure devotional service, a devotee can understand the 
transcendental qualities and the opulences of the Supreme Lord in truth. 
As it is stated in the Eleventh Chapter, only by devotional service can one 
understand. The same is confirmed here; one can understand the Supreme 
Personality of Godhead by devotional service and enter into His kingdom. 
After attainment of the brahma-bhiita stage of freedom from material 
conceptions, devotional service begins by one's hearing about the Lord. 
When one hears about the Supreme Lord, automatically the brahma-bhiita 
stage develops, and material contamination-greediness and lust for sense 
enjoyment-disappears. As lust and desires disappear from the heart of a 
devotee, he becomes more attached to the service of the Lord, and by such 
attachment he becomes free from material contamination. In that state of 
life he can understand the Supreme Lord. This is the statement of Srimad­
Bhiigavatam also. Also after liberation the process of bhakti or transcen­
dental service continues. The Vediinta-siitra confirms this: iipriiyapiit 
tatriipi hi dntam. This means that after liberation the process of devotional 
service continues. In the Srimad-Bhiigavatam, real devotional liberation is 
Text 56] 
Conclusion-The Perfection of Renunciation 
825 
defined as the reinstatement of the living entity in his own identity, his 
own constitutional position. The constitutional position is already ex­
plained: every living entity is the part and parcel fragmental portion of the 
Supreme Lord. Therefore his constitutional position is to serve. After 
liberation, this service is never stopped. Actual liberation is getting free 
from misconceptions of life.

The word mad-vyapasraya[t means under the protection of the Supreme 
Lord. To be free from material contamination, a pure devotee acts under 
the direction of the Supreme Lord or His representative, the spiritual 
master. There is no time limitation for a pure devotee. He is always, 
twenty-four hours, one hundred percent engaged in activities under the 
direction of the Supreme Lord. To a devotee who is thus engaged in Kr�l)a 
consciousness the Lord is very, very kind. In $pite of all difficulties, he is 
eventually phtced in the transcendental abode, or Kr�Qaloka. He is guaran­
teed entrance there; there is no doubt about it. In that supreme abode, 
there is no change; everything is ,eternal, imperishable and full of know­
ledge.

TRANSLATION 
In all activities just depend upon Me and work always under My protec­
tion. In such devotional service, be fully conscious of Me. 
PURPORT 
When one acts in Kr�Q.a consciousness, he does not act as the master of 
the world. Just like a servant, one should act fully under the direction of 
the Supreme Lord. A servant has no individual independence. He acts only 
on the order of the master. A servant acting on behalf of the supreme 
master has no affection for profit and loss. He simply discharges his duty 
faithfully in terms of the order of the Lord. Now, one may argue that 
Arjuna was acting under the personal direction of Kr�Q.a, but, when Kr�Q.a 
is not present, how should one act? If one acts according to the direction 
of Kr�Q.a in this book, as well as under the guidance of the representative 
of Kr�Q.a, then the result will be the same. The Sanskrit word mat-para[l is 
very important in this verse. It indicates that one has no goal in life save 
and except acting in Kr�Q.a consciousness just to satisfy Kr�Q.a. And, while 
working in that way, one should think of Kr�Q.a only: "I have been ap­
pointed to discharge this particular duty by Kr�Q.a." While acting in such a 
way, one naturally has to think of Kr�Q.a. This is perfect Kr�Q.a conscious­
ness. One should, however, note that, after doing something whimsically, 
· 
he should not offer the result to the Supreme Lord. That sort of duty is not 
in the devotional service of Kr�Q.a consciousness. One should act according

827 
to the order of Kr�l}.a. This is a very important point . That order of Kr�l}.a 
comes through disciplic succession from the bona fide spiritual master. 
Therefore the spiritual master's order should be taken as the prime duty of 
life. If one gets a b ona fide spiritual master and acts according to his 
direction, then his perfection of life in Kr�l}.a consciousness is guaranteed.

If you become conscious of Me, you will pass over all the obstacles of 
conditional life by My grace. If, however, you do not work in such con­
sciousness but act through false ego, not hearing Me, you will be lost. 
PURPORT 
A person in full Kr�l}.a consciousness is not unduly anxious to execute 
the duties of his existence. The foolish cannot understand this great free­
dom from all anxiety. For one who acts in Kr�l}.a consciousness, Lord 
Kr�l}.a becomes the most intimate friend. He always looks after His friend's 
comfort, and He gives Himself to His friend, who is so devotedly engaged 
working twenty-four hours a day to please the Lord. Therefore, no one 
should be carried away by the false ego of the bodily concept of life. One 
should not falsely think himself independent of the laws of material nature 
or free to act. He is already under strict material laws. But, as soon as he 
acts in Kn;l}.a consciousness, he is liberated, free from the material perplexi-

ties. One should note very carefully that one who is not active in Kr�va 
consciousness is losing himself in the material whirlpool, in the ocean of 
birth and death. No conditioned soul actually knows what is to be done 
and what is not to be done, but a person who acts in Kr!lva consciousness 
is free to act because everything is prompted by Kr�va from within and 
confirmed by the spiritual master.

PURPORT 
Arjuna was a military man, and born of the nature of the k§atriya. 
Therefore his natural duty was to fight. But, due to false ego, he was 
fearing that by killing his teacher, grandfather and friends, there would be 
sinful reactions. Actually he was considering himself master of his actions, 
as if he were directing the good and bad results of such work. He forgot 
that the Supreme Personality of Godhead was present there, instructing 
him to fight. That is the forgetfulness of the conditioned soul. The Su­
preme Personality gives directions as to what is good and what is bad, and 
one simply has to act in Kpgta consciousness to attain the perfection of

life. No one can ascertain his destiny as the Supreme Lord can; therefore 
th� best course is to take direction from the Supreme Lord and act. No 
one should neglect the order of the Supreme Personality of Godhead or 
the order of the spiritual master who is the representative of God. One 
should act unhesitatingly to execute the order of the Supreme Personality 
of Godhead-that will keep him safe under all circumstances.

If one refuses to act under the direction of the Supreme Lord, then he 
is compelled to act by the modes in which he is situated. Everyone is under 
the spell of a particular combination of the modes of nature and is acting 
in that way. But anyone who voluntarily engages himself under the direc­
tion of the Supreme Lord becomes glorious.

TRANSLATION 
The Supreme Lord is situated in everyone's heart, 0 Arjuna, and is 
directing the wanderings of all living entities, who are seated as on a 
machine, made of the material energy. 
PURPORT 
Arjuna was not the supreme knower, and his decision to fight or not to 
fight was confined to his limited discretion. Lord Kr�pa instructed that 
the individual is not all in all. The Supreme Personality of Godhead, or He 
Himself, Kr�pa, the localized Supersoul, sits in the heart directing the living 
being. After changing bodies, the living entity forgets his past deeds, but 
the Supersoul, as the knower of the past, present and future, remains the 
witness of all his activities. Therefore all the activities of living entities are 
directed by this Supersoul. The living entity gets what he deserves and is 
carried by the material body which is created in the material energy under 
the direction of the Supersoul. As soon as a living entity is placed in a 
particular type of body, he has to work under the spell of that bodily 
situation. A person seated in a high-speed motor car goes faster than one 
seated in a slower car, though the living entities, the drivers, may be the 
same. Similarly, by the order of the Supreme Soul, material nature fashions 
a particular type of body to a particular type of living entity to work ac­
cording to his past desires. The living entity is not independent. One should 
not think himself independent of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. 
The individual is always under His control. Therefore his duty is to sur­
render, and that is the injunction of the next verse.

0 scion of Bharata, surrender unto Him utterly. By His grace you will

PURPORT 
A living entity should therefore surrender unto the Supreme Personality 
of Godhead who is situated in everyone's heart, and that will relieve him 
from all kinds of miseries of this material existence. By such surrender, 
one will not only be released from all miseries in this life, but at the end 
he will reach the Supreme God. The transcendental world is described in 
the Vedic literature as tad v�r-oP paramam padam. Since all of creation is 
the kingdom of God, everything material is actually spiritual, but paramam 
padam specifically refers to the eternal abode, which is called the spiritual 
sky or V aikuptha. 
In the Fifteenth Chapter of Bhagavad-gitii it is stated: "Sarvasya ciiham 
hrdi sanniv�fap." The Lord is seated in everyone's heart, so this recom­
mendation that one should surrender unto the Supersoul sitting within 
means that one should surrender unto the Supreme Personality of God­
head, Kr�pa. Kr�pa has already been accepted by Arjuna as the Supreme. 
He was accepted in the Tenth Chapter as param brahma param dhiima. 
Arjuna has accepted Kr�pa as the Supreme Personality of Godhead and the 
supreme abode of all living entities, not only because of his personal expe­
rience but also because of the evidences of great authorities like Narada, 
Asita, Devala and Vyasa.

TRANSLATION 
Thus I have explained to you the most confidential of all knowledge.· 
Deliberate on this fully, and then do what you wish to do. 
PURPORT 
The Lord has already explained to Arjuna the knowledge of brahma� 
bhuta. One who is in the brahma-bhuta condition is joyful; he never la­
ments, nor does he desire anything. That is due to confidential know­
ledge. Kr�tta also discloses knowledge of the Supersoul. This is also 
Brahman knowledge, knowledge of Brahman, but it is superior. 
Here Lord Kr�tta tells Arjuna that he can do as he chooses. God does 
not interfere with the little independence of the living entity. In Bhagavad­
gitii, the Lord has explained in all respects how one can elevate his living 
condition. The best advice imparted to Arjuna is to surrender unto the 
Supersoul seated within his heart. By right discrimination, one should 
agree to act according to the order of the Supersoul. That will help one 
become situated constantly in Kr�tta consciousness, the highest perfection­
a} stage of human life. Arjuna is being directly ordered by the Personality 
of Godhead to fight. Surrender to the Supreme Personality of Godhead is 
in the best interest of the living entities. It is not for the interest of the 
Supreme. Before surrendering, one is free to deliberate on this subject as 
far as the intelligence goes; that is the best way to accept the instruction of 
the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Such instruction comes also through 
the spiritual master, the bona fide representative of Kr�tta.

PURPORT 
The Lord has given Arjuna confidential knowledge of the Supersoul 
within everyone's heart, and now He is giving the most confidential part of 
this knowledge: just surrender unto the Supreme Personality of Godhead. 
At the end of the Ninth Chapter He has said, ''Just always think of Me." 
The same instruction is repeated here to stress the essence of the teachings 
of Bhagavad-gitU. This essence is not understood by a common man, but 
by one who is actually very dear to Kr�!la, a pure devotee of Kr�!la. This is 
the most important instruction in all Vedic literature. What Kr�!la is saying 
in this connection is the most essential part of knowledge, and it should be 
carried out not only by Arjuna but by all living entities.

TRANSLATION 
Always think of Me and become My devotee. Worship Me and offer

you this because you are My very dear friend. 
PURPORT 
The most confidential part of knowledge is that one should become a 
pure devotee of Kr�pa and always think of Him and act for Him. One 
should not become an official meditator. Life should be so molded that 
one will always have the chance to think of Kr�pa. One should always act 
in such a way that all his daily activities are in connection with Kr�pa. He 
should arrange his life in such a way that throughout the twenty-four hours 
he cannot but think of Kr�pa. And the Lord's promise is that anyone who 
is in such pure Kr�pa consciousness will certainly return to the abode of 
Kr�pa, where he will be engaged in the association of Kr�pa face to face. 
This most confidential part of knowledge is spoken to Arjuna because he 
is the dear friend of Kr�l).a. Everyone who follows the path of Arjuna can 
become a dear friend to Kr�pa and obtain the same perfection as Arjuna. 
These words stress that one should concentrate his mind upon Kr�pa­
the very form with two hands carrying a flute, the bluish boy with a 
beautiful face and peacock feathers in His hair. There are descriptions of 
Krwa found in the Brahma-sarhhitii and other literatures. One should fix 
his mind on this original form of Godhead, Kr�pa. He should not even 
divert his attention to other forms of the Lord. The Lord has multi-forms, 
as Vi�pu, Narayapa, Rama, Varaha, etc., but a devotee should concentrate 
his mind on the form that was present before Arjuna. Concentration of 
the mind on the form of Kr�pa constitutes the most confidential part of 
knowledge, and this is disclosed to Arjuna because Arjuna is the most dear 
friend of Kr�pa 's.

TRANSLATION 
Abandon all varieties of religion and just surrender unto Me. I shall 
deliver you from all sinful reaction. Do not fear. 
PURPORT 
The Lord has described various kinds of knowledge, processes of religion, 
knowledge of the Supreme Brahman, knowledge of the Supersoul, know­
ledge of the different types of orders and statuses of social life, knowledge 
of the renounced order of life, knowledge of nonattachment, sense and 
mind control, meditation, etc. He has described in so many ways different 
types of religion. Now, in summarizing Bhagavad-gitii, the Lord says that 
Arjuna should give up all the processes that have been explained to him; he 
should simply surrender to Kr�pa. That surrender will save him from all 
kinds of sinful reactions, for the Lord personally promises to protect him. 
In the Eighth Chapter it was said that only one who has become free 
from all sinful reactions can take to the worship of Lord Kr�pa. Thus one 
may think that unless he is free from all sinful reactions he cannot take to 
the surrendering process. To such doubts it is here said that even if one is 
not free from all sinful reactions, simply by the process of surrendering to 
�ri Kr�pa he is automatically freed. There is no need of strenuous effort to 
free oneself from sinful reactions. One should unhesitatingly accept Kr�pa 
as the supreme savior of all living entities. With faith and love, one should 
surrender unto Him. 
According to the devotional process, one should simply accept such 
religious principles that will lead ultimately to the devotional service of the 
Lord. One may perform a particular occupational duty according to his 
position in the social order, but if by executing his duty one does not 
come to the point of Kr�pa consciousness, all his activities are in vain. 
836 
Bhagavad-gita As It Is 
[Ch. 18 
Anything that does not lead to the perfectional stage of Kr�pa conscious­
ness should be avoided. One should be confident that in all circumstances 
Kr�pa will protect him from all difficulties. There is no need of thinking 
how one should keep the body and soul together. Kr�pa will see to that. 
One should always think himself helpless and should consider Kr�pa the 
only basis for his progress in life. As soon as one seriously engages himself 
in devotional service to the Lord in full Kr�pa consciousness, at once he 
becomes freed from all contamination of material nature. There are dif­
ferent processes of religion and purificatory processes by cultivation of 
knowledge, meditation in the mystic yoga system, etc., but one who 
surrenders unto Kr�pa does not have to execute so many methods. That 
simple surrender unto Kr�pa will save him from unnecessarily wasting 
time. One can thus make all progress at once and be freed from all sinful 
reaction. 
One should be attracted by the beautiful vision of Kr�pa. His name is 
Kr�pa because He is all-attractive. One who becomes attracted by the 
beautiful, all-powerful, omnipotent vision of Kr�pa is fortunate. There are 
different kinds of transcendentalists-some of them are attached to the 
impersonal Brahman vision, some of them are attracted by the Supersoul 
feature, etc., but one who is attracted to the personal feature of the 
Supreme Personality of Godhead, and, above all, one who is attracted by 
the Supreme Personality of Godhead as 15-r�pa Himself, is the most perfect 
transcendentalist. In other words, devotional service to Kr�pa, in full con­
sciousness, is the most confidential part of knowledge, and this is the 
essence of the whole Bhagavad-gitii. Karma-yogis, empiric philosophers, 
mystics, and devotees are all called transcendentalists, but one who is a 
pure devotee is the best of all. The particular words used here, mii sucalz, 
"Don't fear, don't hesitate, don't worry," are very significant. One may be 
perplexed as to how one can give up all kinds· of religious forms and 
simply surrender unto Kr�pa, but such worry is useless.

This confidential knowledge may not be explained to those who are not

PURPORT 
Persons who have not undergone the austerities of the religious process, 
who have never attempted devotional service in Kr�pa consciousness, who 
have not tended a pure devotee, and especially those who are conscious of 
Kr�pa as a historical personality or who are envious of the greatness of 
Kr�pa, should not be told this most confidential part of knowledge. It is, 
however, sometimes found that even demoniac persons who are envious of 
Kr�pa, worshiping Kr�pa in a different way, take to the profession of 
explaining Bhagavad-gitii in a different way to make business, but anyone 
who desires actually to understand Kr�pa must avoid such commentaries 
on Bhagavad-gitii. Actually the purpose of Bhagavad-gitii is not understand­
able to those who are sensuous-even if one is not sensuous but is strictly 
following the disciplines enjoined in the Vedic scripture, if he is not a 
devotee, he also cannot understand Kr�pa. Even when one poses himself as 
a devotee of Kr�pa, but is not engaged in Kr�pa conscious activities, he 
also cannot understand Kr�pa. There are many persons who envy Kr�pa 
because He has explained in Bhagavad-gitii that He is the Supreme and that 
nothing is above Him or equal to Him. There are many persons who are 
envious of Kr�pa. Such persons should not be told of Bhagavad-gitii, for 
they cannot understand. There is no possibility of faithless persons' under­
standing Bhagavad-gitii and Kr�pa. Without understanding Kr�pa from the 
authority of a pure devotee, one should not try to comment upon 
Bhagavad-gitii.

TRANSLATION 
For one who explains the supreme secret to the devotees, devotional

PURPORT 
Generally it is advised that Bhagavad-gitii be discussed amongst the 
devotees only, for those who are not devotees will neither understand 
Kr�pa nor Bhagavad-gitii. Those who do not accept Kr�pa as He is and 
Bhagavad-gitii as it is should not try to explain Bhagavad-gitii whimsically 
and become offenders. Bhagavad-gitii should be explained to persons who 
are ready to accept Kr�pa as the Supreme Personality of Godhead. It is a 
subject matter for the devotees only and not for philosophical speculators. 
Anyone, however, who tries sincerely to present Bhagavad-gitii as it is will 
advance in devotional activities and reach the pure devotional state of life. 
As a result of such pure devotion, he is sure to go back home, back to 
Godhead.

TRANSLATION 
And one who listens with faith and without envy becomes free from 
sinful reaction and attains to the planets where the pious dwell. 
PURPORT 
In the 67th verse of this chapter, the Lord explicitly forbade the Gitii's 
being spoken to those who are envious of the Lord. In other words, 
Bhagavad-gitii is for the devotees only, but it so happens that sometimes a 
devotee of the Lord will hold open class, and in that class all the students 
are not expected to be devotees. Why do such persons hold open class? It 
is explained here that although everyone is not a devotee, still there are 
many men who are not envious of Kr�pa. They have faith in Him as the 
Supreme Personality of Godhead. If such persons hear from a bona fide 
devotee about the Lord, the result is that they become at once free from 
all sinful reactions and after that attain to the planetary system where all 
righteous persons are situated. Therefore simply by hearing Bhagavad-gitii, 
even a person who does not try to be a pure devotee attains the result of 
righteous activities. Thus a pure devotee of the Lord gives everyone a 
chance to become free from all sinful reactions and to become a devotee of 
the Lord. 
Generally those who are free from sinful reaction are righteous. Such 
persons very easily take to Kr�pa consciousness. The word pupya­
karmapiim is very significant here. This refers to the performance of great 
sacrifice. Those who are righteous in performing devotional service but 
who are not pure can attain the planetary system of the polestar, or 
Dhruvaloka, where Dhruva Maharaja is presiding. He is a great devotee of 
the Lord, and he has a special planet which is called the polestar.

0 conqueror of wealth, Arjuna, have you heard this attentively with 
your mind? And are your illusions and ignorance now dispelled? 
PURPORT 
The Lord was acting as the spiritual master of Arjuna. Therefore it was 
His duty to inquire from Arjuna whether he understood the whole 
Bhagavad-gitii in its proper perspective. If not, the Lord was ready to 
re-explain any point, or the whole Bhagavad-gitii if so required. Actually, 
anyone who hears Bhagavad-gitii from a bona fide spiritual master like 
Kr�p.a or His representative will find that all his ignorance is dispelled. 
Bhagavad-gitii is not an ordinary book written by a poet or fiction writer; 
it is spoken by the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Any person, if he is 
fortunate enough to hear these teachings from Kr�p.a or from His bona 
fide spiritual representative, is sure to become a liberated person and get 
out of the darkness of ignorance.

Arjuna said, My dear Kr�!la, 0 infallible one, my illusion is now gone. I 
have regained my memory by Your mercy, and I am now firm and free 
from doubt and am prepared to act according to Your instructions. 
PURPORT 
The constitutional position of a living entity, represented by Arjuna, is 
that he has to act according to the order of the Supreme Lord. He is meant 
for self-discipline. Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu says that the actual position 
of the living entity is that of eternal servant of the Supreme Lord. Forget­
ting this principle, the living entity becomes conditioned by material na­
ture, but in serving the Supreme Lord, he becomes the liberated servant of 
God. The living entity's constitutional position is to be servitor; he either 
has to serve the illusory miiyii or the Supreme Lord. If he serves the 
Supreme Lord, he is in his normal condition, but if he prefers to serve 
the illusory external energy, then certainly he will be in bondage. In 
illusion the living entity is serving in this material world. He is bound by 
his lust and desires, yet he thinks of himself as the master of the world. 
This is called illusion. When a person is liberated, his illusion is over, and 
he voluntarily surrenders unto the Supreme to act according to His desires. 
The last illusion, the last snare of miiyii to trap the living entity, is the 
proposition that he is God. The living entity thinks that he is no longer a 
conditioned soul, but God. He is so unintelligent that he does not think 
that if he were God, then how could he be in doubt? That he does not 
consider. So that is the last snare of illusion. Actually to become free 
from the illusory energy is to understand Kr�pa, the Supreme Personality 
of Godhead, and agree to act according to His order. The word moha� is 
very important in this verse. Moha� refers to that which is opposed to 
knowledge. Actually real knowledge is the understanding that every living 
being is eternally servitor of the Lord, but instead of thinking oneself in 
that position, the living entity thinks that he is not servant, that he is the 
master of this material world, for he wants to lord it over the material 
nature. That is his illusion. This illusion can be overcome by the mercy of 
I 
Text 74] 
Conclusion-The Perfection of Renunciation 
843. 
the Lord or by the mercy of a pure devotee. When that illusion is over, one 
agrees to act in Kr�pa consciousness. 
Kr�pa consciousness is acting according to Kr�pa's order. A conditioned 
soul illusioned by the external energy of matter does not know that the 
Supreme Lord is the master who is full of knowledge and who is the 
proprietor of everything. Whatever He desires He can bestow upon His 
devotees; He is the friend of everyone, and He is especially inclined to His 
devotee. He is the controller of this material nature and of all living 
entities. He is also the controller of inexhaustible time, and He is full of all 
opulences and all potencies. The Supreme Personality of Godhead can even 
give Himself to the devotee. One who does not know Him is under the 
spell of illusion; he does not become a devotee, but a servitor of miiyii. 
Arjuna, however, after hearing Bhagavad-gitii from the Supreme Personality 
of Godhead, became free from all illusion. He could understand that Kr�pa 
was not only his friend, but the Supreme Personality of Godhead. And he 
understood Kr�pa factually. So to study Bhagavad-gitii is to understand 
Kr�pa factually. When a person is in full knowledge, he naturally surrenders 
to Kr�pa. When Arjuna understood that it was Kr�pa's plan to reduce the 
unnecessary increase of population, he agreed to fight according to Kr�pa's 
desire. He again took up his weapons-his arrows and bow-to fight under 
the order of the Supreme Personality of Godhead.

Saiijaya said: Thus have I heard the conversation of two great souls, 
Km•a and Arjuna. And so wonderful is that message that my hair is stand­
ing on end. 
PURPORT 
In the beginning of Bhagavad-gitii, Dhrtar�tra inquired from his secre­
tary Safijaya, "What happened in the Battlefield of Kuruk�etra?" The 
entire study was related to the heart of Safijaya by the grace of his spiritual 
master, Vyasa. He thus explained the theme of the battlefield. The conver­
sation was wonderful because such an important conversation between two 
great souls never took place before and would not take place again. It is 
wonderful because the Supreme Personality of Godhead is speaking about 
Himself and His energies to the living entity, A�una, a great devotee of the 
Lord. If we follow in the footsteps of Arjuna to understand Kr�pa, then 
our life will be happy and successful. Safijaya realized this, and as he began 
to understand it, he related the conversation to Dhrtara�tra. Now it is 
concluded that wherever there is Kr�pa and Arjuna, there is victory.

Conclusion-The Perfection of Renunciation 
845 
PURPORT 
Vyasa was the spiritual master of Safijaya, and Safijaya admits that it 
was by his mercy that he could understand the Supreme Personality of 
Godhead. This means that one has to understand Krwa not directly but 
through the medium of the spiritual master. The spiritual master is the 
transparent medium, although it is true that the experience is direct. This 
is the mystery of the disciplic succession. When the spiritual master is bona 
fide, then one can hear Bhagavad-gitii directly, as Arjuna heard it. 'There 
are many mystics and yogis all over the world, but Kr�p.a is the master of 
all yoga systems. Kr�t:Ja's instruction is explicitly stated in Bhagavad-gitii­
surrender unto Kr�p.a. One who does so is the topmost yogi. This is con­
firmed in the last verse of the Sixth Chapter. Yoginiim api saroe§iim. 
Narada is the direct disciple of Kr�p.a and the spiritual master of Vyasa. 
Therefore Vyasa is as bona fide as Arjuna because he comes in the disciplic 
succession, and Safijaya is the direct disciple of Vyasa. Therefore by the 
grace of Vyasa, his senses were purified, and he could see and hear Kr�p.a 
directly. One who directly hears Kr�!Ja can understand this confidential 
knowledge. If or<e does not come to the disciplic succession, he cannot 
hear Kr�p.a; therefore his knowledge is always imperfect, at least as far as 
understanding Bhagavad-gitii is concerned. 
In Bhagavad-gitii, all the yoga systems, karma-yoga, jiiiina-yoga and 
bhakti-yoga, are explained. Kr�p.a is the master of all such mysticism. It is 
to be understood, however, that as Arjuna was fortunate enough to under­
stand Kr�p.a directly, similarly, by the grace of Vyasa, Safijaya was also 
able to hear Kr�t;la directly. Actually there is no difference in hearing 
directly from Kr�p.a or hearing directly from Kf�t;la via a bona fide spiritual 
master like Vyasa. The spiritual master is the representative of Vyasadeva 
also. According to the Vedic system, on the birthday of the spiritual 
master, the disciples conduct the ceremony called Vyiisa-pujii.

The understanding of Bhagavad-gitii is so transcendental that anyone 
who becomes conversant with the topics of Arjuna and Kr�pa becomes 
righteous, and he cannot forget such talks. This is the transcendental 
position of spiritual life. In other words, one who hears the Gitii from the 
right source, directly from Kr�pa, attains full Kr�pa consciousness. The 
result of Kr�pa consciousness is that one becomes increasingly enlightened, 
and he enjoys life with a thrill, not only for some time, but at every 
moment.

It appears that Safijaya also, by the grace of Vyasa, could see the 
universal form of Km1a exhibited to Arjuna. It is, of course, said that 
Lord Kr�pa never exhibited such a form before. It was exhibited to Arjuna 
only, yet some great devotees could also see the universal form of Kr�pa 
when it was shown to Arjuna, and Vyasa was one of them. He is one of the 
great devotees of the Lord, and he is considered to be a powerful incarna­
tion of Kr�I].a. Vyasa disclosed this to his disciple, Safijaya, who remem­
bered that wonderful form of Kr�I].a exhibited to Arjuna and enjoyed it 
repeatedly.

Wherever there is Kr�pa, the master of all mystics, and wherever there 
is Arjuna, the supreme archer, there will also certainly be opulence, victo­
ry, extraordinary power, and morality. That is my opinion. 
PURPORT 
The Bhagavad-gitii began with an inquiry of Dhrtara�tra. He was hopeful 
of the victory of his sons, assisted by great warriors like Bhi�ma, Dropa 
and Karpa. He was hopeful that the victory would be on his side. But, after 
describing the scene in the battlefield, Safijaya told the King, "You are 
848 
Bhagavad-gita As It Is 
[Ch. 18 
thinking of victory, but my opinion is that where Kr�pa and Arjuna are 
present, there will be all good fortune." He directly confirmed that 
Dhrtara�tra could not expect victory for his side. Victory was certain for 
the side of Arjuna because Kr�pa was there. Kr�pa's acceptance of the post 
of charioteer for Arjuna was an exhibition of another opulence. Kr�pa is 
full of all opulences, and renunciation is one of them. There are many 
instances of such renunciation, for Krwa is also the master of renunciation. 
The fight was actually between Duryodhana and Yudhi�thira. Arjuna 
was fighting on behalf of his elder brother, Yudhi�thira. Because Kr�pa and 
Arjuna were on the side of Yudhi�thira, Yudhi�thira's victory was certain. 
The battle was to decide who would rule the world, and Safijaya predicted 
that the power would be transferred to Yudhi�thira. It is also predicted 
here that Yudhi�thira, after gaining victory in this battle, would flourish 
more and more because he was not only righteous and pious, but he was a 
strict moralist. He never spoke a lie during his life. 
There are many less intelligent persons who take Bhagavad-gitii to be a 
discussion of topics between two friends in a battlefield. But such a book 
cannot be scripture. Some may protest that Kr�pa incited Arjuna to fight, 
which is immoral, but the reality of the situation is clearly stated: 
Bhagavad-gitii is the supreme instruction in morality. The supreme instruc­
tion of morality is stated in the Ninth Chapter, in the thirty-fourth verse: 
manmanii bhava mad-bhakta�. One must become a devotee of Kr�pa, and 
the essence of all religion is to surrender unto Kr�pa, as stated, Sarva­
dharmiin. The instructions of Bhagavad-gitii constitute the supreme process 
of religion and of morality. All other processes may be purifying and may 
lead to this process, but the last instruction of the Gitii is the last word in 
all morality and religion: surrender unto Kr�pa. This is the verdict of the 
Eighteenth Chapter. 
From Bhagavad-gitii we can understand that to realize oneself by philo­
sophical speculation and by meditation is one process, but to fully surren­
der unto Kr�pa is the highest perfection. This is the essence of the teach­
ings of Bhagavad-gitii. The path of regulative principles according to the 
orders of social life and according to the different courses of religion may 
be a confidential path of knowledge in as far as the rituals of religion are 
confidential, but one is still involved with meditation and cultivation of 
knowledge. Surrender unto Krwa in devotional service in full Kr�pa con­
sciousness is the most confidential instruction and is the essence of the 
Eighteenth Chapter. 
Another feature of Bhagavad-gitii is that the actual truth is the Supreme 
Personality of Godhead, Kr�pa. Absolute Truth is realized in three fea-
Text 78] 
Conclusion-The Perfection of Renunciation 
849 
lures-impersonal Brahman, localized Para:tnatma, and the Supreme Person­
ality of Godhead, Kr�pa. Perfect knowledge of the Absolute Truth means 
perfect knowledge of Kr�pa. If one understands Kr�pa, then all the depart­
ments of knowledge are part and parcel of that understanding. Kr�pa is 
transcendental, for He is always situated in His eternal internal potency. 
The living entities are manifested and are divided into two classes, eternally 
conditioned and eternally liberated. Such living entities are innumerable, 
and they are considered fundamental parts of Kr�pa. Material energy is 
manifested into twenty-four divisions. The creation is effected by eternal 
time, and it is created and dissolved by external energy. This manifestation 
of the cosmic world repeatedly becomes visible and invisible. 
In Bhagavad-gita five principal subject matters have been discussed: the 
Supreme Personality of Godhead, material nature, the living entities, eter­
nal time and all kinds of activities. All of these are dependent on the Su­
preme Personality of Godhead, Kr�pa. All conceptions of the Absolute 
Truth, namely, impersonal Brahman, localized Paramatma, or any other 
transcendental conception, exist within the category of understanding the 
Supreme Personality of Godhead. Although superficially the Supreme 
Personality of Godhead, the living entity, material nature and time appear 
to be different, nothing is different from the Supreme. But the Supreme is 
always different from everything. Lord Caitanya's philosophy is that of 
"inconceivably one and different." This system of philosophy constitutes 
perfect knowledge of the Absolute Truth. 
The living entity in his original position is pure spirit. He is just like an 
atomic particle of the Supreme Spirit. The conditioned living entity, how­
ever, is the marginal energy of the Lord; he tends to be in contact with 
both the material energy and the spiritual energy. In other words, the 
living entity is situated between the two energies of the Lord, and because 
he belongs to the superior energy of the Lord, he has a particle of indepen­
dence. By proper use of that independence he comes under the direct order 
of Kr�pa. Thus he attains his normal condition in the pleasure-giving 
potency. 
Thus end the Bhaktivedanta Purports to the Eighteenth Chapter of the 
Srimad-Bhagavad-gita in the matter of its Conclusions-the Perfection of 
Renunciation.

The huge lotus is the original spiritual planet, Goloka 
Vrndavana, the abode of Radha and Kr�qa. The spiritual effulgence around 
this planet is the brahmajyoti, which is the ultimate goal of the imperson­
alists. Within the unlimited brahmajyoti are innumerable spiritual planets . 
which are dominated by plenary expansions of Lord Kr�qa and inhabited 
by ever-liberated living beings. Sometimes a spiritual cloud overtakes a 
corner of the spiritual sky, and the covered portion is called mahat-tattva, 
or the material sky. The Lord, as Maha-Vi�J)U, lies down in the water 
within the mahat-tattva, which is called the Causal Ocean. While Lord 
Vi�J)U sleeps, innumerable universes generate from His breathing and 
float all over the Causal Ocean. Mah�: Vi�J)U enters each universe as 
Garbhodakasayi Vi�pu and lies in the Garbha Ocean on the serpentine 
Se�a incarnation. From His navel a lotus stem sprouts, and on the lotus, 
Brahma, the lord of the universe, is born. Brahma creates all the living 
beings in different shapes in terms of their desires within the universe. He 
also creates the sun, moon and other demigods.

worshiping a tree which is inhabited by a ghost, and a man is worshiping 
the tomb of a dead man. 
Chapter 18 
Plate 41 
18.14 
Endeavor means energy which is employed. For anything 
one does there must be some activity; that is the endeavor. The place must 
be favorable, the activities must be authorized, the doer (the man who is 
acting) must be expert, the instruments must be fit, and the help from 
the Supersoul must be adequate. Thes� are the five causes for success, and 
the opposite are the five factors for failure. 
Here a man is conducting business. If he goes to the marketplace it will 
be very nice, since there are so many customers. Similarly, one looking for 
spiritual life goes to where there are devotees and associates with them. 
One must go to a particular type of place for a particular type of activity, 
and the person acting must be well versed, or expert, just like an expert 
salesman whose method of business is bona fide. The senses must be in 
order, to guard against cheating, hear offers, etc. Above all is the help from 
Supersoul, who dictates in such a way that everything is successful, spiri­
tually or materially. Among the five factors portrayed here, the endeavor 
is the business which is being conducted.

of 
a;t??vad-gita 
"By bringing us a new and living interpretation of 
a text already known to many. A.C. Bhaktivedanta 
Swami Prabhupada has increased our understanding 
manyfold." 
--Pro'fessor Edward C. Dimock, Jr. 
Department of South Ac;ian Languages 
and Civilization, University of Chicago 
masterpiece of scriptural literature, Bhagavad-gita is a sacred "song" in the 
form of a battlefield dialogue between the Lord Sri Kr�l')a and Arjuna, His 
friend and disciple. Kr�l')a, at.ting as Arjuna's adviser, instructs him in the 
science of self-realization, teaching him how to live as a devotee of the Lord and to 
thus reach the eternal spiritual world w�.ile continuing to perform his earthly duties. 
SrTia Prabhupada's Gita, completely new in its authenticity, is addressrd to all 
humanity, for it clearly teac,'les the pur.,:>o�e of the human form of life-to r;ultivate 
spiritual knowledge. This edition of 'che work presents this knowledge as it was 
originally handed down, without being adulterated by philosophical interpretation. 
It is fully indexed and cross-referenced and is illustrated with forty-four magnificent 
full-color paintings--original works paint(:d especially for this volume to depict events 
in the Gita and exemplify the teaching!• of Kr�l')a. Containing the original Sanskrit 
text, 
Roman 
transliterations, 
English 
syno:-�yms, 
translation and commentary, 
Bhagavad-gita As It Is is the most comp l ete and authoritative transmission of this 
timeless scripture in print and the only one that does not obscure the true spirit of 
Kr�l')a's teachings. 
HIS DIVINE GRACE A.C. BH,..'\KTIVEDANTA SWAMI PRABHUPADA, the leading 
exponent of the scieP.ce of Kr�'!a consciousness in the West and the world's most 
distinguished teacher of Vedic religion ;:.nd tho!Jght, is the author of Srimad­
Bhagavatam, KHQa and many other English versions of Vedic literature. He is a fully 
self-realized devotee of Lord Kr�r;Ja and is the latest d�sciple in a succession that 
originally began with Kr�Qa Himself. H e is the founder and spiritual master of the 
lnternatio11al Society for Krishna Consciousness, which now has centers in major 
cities throughout the world.
