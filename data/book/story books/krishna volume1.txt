To My Father, Gour Mohon De (1849-1930)
a pure devotee of Kr  a, who raised me as a
Kr  a conscious child from the beginning of
my life. In my boyhood ages he instructed me
how to play the mrdanga. He gave me Radha
Kr  a Vigraha to worship, and he gave me
Jagannatha-Ratha to duly observe the festival
as my childhood play. He was kind to me, and
I imbibed from him the ideas later on solidified
by my spiritual master, the eternal father.

From App[e
Everybody is looking for K:J;t  A.
Some don't realize that they are, but they are.
K:J;t  A is GOD, the Source of all that exists, the Cause of all that is,
was, or ever will be.
As GOD is unlimited, HE has many Names.
Allah-Buddha-Jehova-Rama: All are K:J;t  A, all are ONE.
God is not abstract; He has both the impersonal and the personal
aspects to His personality which is SUPREME, ETERNAL, BLISSFUL,
and full of KNOWLEDGE. As a single drop of water has the same qualities
as an ocean of water, so has our consciousness the qualities of GOD'S
consciousness . . . but through our identification and attachment with
material energy (physical body, sense pleasures, material possessions, ego,
etc.) our true TRANSCENDENTAL CONSCIOUSNESS has been polluted,
and like a dirty mirror it is unable to reflect a pure image.
With many lives our association with the TEMPORARY has grown.
This impermanent body, a bag of bones and flesh, is mistaken for our true
self, and we have accepted this temporary condition to be final.
Through all ages, great SAINTS have remained as living proof that
this non-temporary, permanent state of GOD CONSCIOUSNESS can be
revived in all living Souls. Each soul is potentially divine.
Kr !la says in Bhagavad Gita: "Steady in the Self, being freed from all
material contamination, the yogi achieves the highest perfectional stage of
happiness in touch with the Supreme Consciousness." (VI, 28)
YOGA (a scientific method for GOD (SELF) realization) is the pro
cess by which we purify our consciousness, stop further pollution, and
arrive at the state of Perfection, full KNOWLEDGE, full BLISS.
If there's a God, I want to see Him. It's pointless to believe in some
thing without proof, and Kr  a Consciousness and meditation are methods
where you can actually obtain GOD perception. You can actually see God,
and hear Him, play with Him. It might sound crazy, but He is actually
there, actually with you.
There are many yogic Paths-Raja, Jnana, Hatha, Kriya, Karma, Bhakti
-which are all acclaimed by the MASTERS of each method.
SWAMI BHAKTIVEDANTA is as his title says, a BHAKTI Yogi
following the path of DEVOTION. By serving GOD through each thought,
word, and DEED, and by chanting of HIS Holy Names, the devotee quickly
develops God-consciousness. By chanting
