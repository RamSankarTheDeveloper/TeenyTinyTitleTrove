Advent of Shri Krishna 
Once 
when 
the 
entire 
world 
was 
overburdened by the demons, demigods 
prayed to Lord Vishnu for help.  
 
Lord Vishnu informed them He would soon 
appear as the son of Vasudeva and Devaki.  
After the marriage of Vasudeva and Devaki, 
while returning home on a chariot driven by 
Kamsa, an ominous voice addressed Kamsa, 
warning him that Devaki's eighth son would 
kill him. Hearing the omens, Kamsa took up a 
sword to kill Devaki.  
 
Then, Vasudeva pacified Kamsa. Kamsa did 
not kill Devaki but imprisoned both Vasudeva 
and Devaki. 
 
As foretold by the Lord, He entered the womb 
of Mother Devaki and all the demigods came 
to offer their prayers.  
 
Lord Krishna took His birth as the eighth son 
of Vasudeva and Devaki. He appeared in His 
four-handed Vishnu form.  
 
Vasudeva and Devaki offered their prayers to 
Lord Krishna. 
 
Then, the Lord ordered Vasudeva to take Him 
to Gokula and exchange Him with the 
daughter born to Mother Yashoda. At that 
time all the doorkeepers were in deep sleep 
and 
the 
doors 
automatically 
opened. 
Vasudeva carried Krishna to Gokula. 
 
Lord Anantasesha spread His hoods to give 
the Lord shelter.  
 
 
Reaching 
Gokula, 
Vasudeva 
exchanged 
Krishna with the daughter born to Mother 
Yashoda and retured back to the prison in 
Mathura. 
 
Kamsa tried to kill the newborn child of 
Mother Devaki, but the child rose above his 
head and appeared as the eight-armed form 
of Durga. Mother Durga then told Kamsa that 
the Lord had taken birth somewhere else. 
 
Hearing this, Kamsa ordered his men to kill 
all children who were born within ten days.  
In Gokula, Nanda Maharaja arranged for a 
magnificent birth ceremony.  
 
Fearing Kamsa, Nanda Maharaj secretly 
performed the name giving ceremony of 
Krishna and Balarama by Garga Muni. 
 
Garga Muni said that the child would have 
power, beauty, and opulence, all on the level 
of Narayana, the Supreme Personality of 
Godhead. 
 
nanda ke ānanda bhāiyo jaya kanhaiyā lāl kī 
jaya kanhaiyā lāl kī jaya kanhaiyā lāl kī 
hathi dīnī ghoḍā dīnī ane dīnī pālakī 
nanda ke ānanda bhāiyo jaya kanhaiyā lāl kī 
javāneń ko hāthi ghoḍe buḍḍheń ko palki 
nanda ke ānanda bhāiyo jaya kanhaiyā lāl kī 
And Krishna became the darling of Vrindavan 
because of His uncommon activities. 
 
Balyalila 
Kamsa sent Putana demoness, who was 
wandering here and there killing small 
babies. Putana tried to feed Krishna her 
poison smeared breast milk, but Krishna 
sucked her life air and killed her.  
 
Once when mother Yashoda put Krishna 
underneath a household cart, Krishna kicked 
the cart and killed the demon Shakatasura.  
 
One day, Trinavarta, one of the servants of 
Kamsa, appeared as a whirlwind and took 
Krishna away. 
 
Krishna grasped the demon by his neck so 
tightly that the demon died immediately.  
 
Once when baby Krishna yawned, mother 
Yashoda could see within His mouth the 
entire universal manifestation.  
 
Krishna and Balarama would sometimes steal 
butter from the gopis homes. 
 
One day, Krishna having been interrupted in 
His business of sucking the breast, became 
very angry. He entered a room and began to 
eat the freshly churned butter.  
 
When Krishna and Balarama stole butter and 
distributed the butter to the monkeys, 
mother Yashoda chased them with a stick in 
hand.  
 
As soon as Krishna saw His mother, He 
immediately ran away, and mother Yashoda 
followed Him.  
Krishna cried and rubbed His eyes again and 
again with His two lotus hands. His eyes were 
fearful, 
 
Mother Yashoda caught Krishna and bound 
Him to a grinding mortar.  
 
Krishna crawled with the mortar in the 
courtyard and pulled down the two yamala-
arjuna trees, and delivered Nalakuvara and 
Manigriva. 
 
Nalakuvara and Manigriva were condemned 
by Narada Muni to become trees.  
 
One day, Krishna took some grain in His little 
palms and went to the vendor to exchange 
the grains for fruit. On the way, almost all the 
grains fell from His palms, only one or two 
grains remained. The fruit vendor, out of full 
affection, accepted these grains in exchange 
for as much fruit as Krishna could take. As 
soon as she did this, her basket became filled 
with gold and jewels. 
 
Later, fearing the demons, the inhabitants of 
Gokula left Gokula and went to Vrindavana. 
There Krishna killed Vatsasura and Bakasura. 
 
Kaumaralila 
One day Krishna wanted to enjoy a picnic 
lunch within the forest, and therefore He 
went out early into the forest with the other 
cowherd 
boys, 
accompanied 
by 
their 
respective groups of calves.  
 
While they were enjoying their picnic, 
Aghasura, assumed the form of a python. 
Krishna's cowherd friends entered within the 
mouth of this gigantic python.  
 
As soon as Krishna entered within the 
demon's mouth, Krishna expanded His body 
to such an extent that the demon suffocated 
and died.  
 
While Krishna and His friends were enjoying 
their picnic, Lord Brahma stole the calves and 
later stole the cowherd boys.  
 
Not finding the boys and calves, Krishna 
expanded Himself to become the calves and 
boys, exactly as they were before.  
Because of this the parents of the cowherd 
boys 
became 
more 
attached 
to 
their 
respective sons, and the cows became more 
attached to their calves.  
 
When one full year had passed, Lord Brahma 
returned and saw that Krishna was still 
engaged as usual with His friends and the 
calves and cows.  
 
Then Krishna exhibited to Brahma, all the 
calves and cowherd boys as four-armed 
forms of Narayana. 
 
Seeing this Lord Brahma was astonished and 
he offered prayers to Krishna. 
 
Lord Brahma offered his obeisance’s to 
Krishna and begged for His forgiveness.  
 
When the cowherd boys wanted to enjoy the 
sweet fruits of Talavana, Krishna and 
Balarama killed the demon Dhenuka and his 
associates.  
 
In the island of the snakes, Kaliya would eat 
offerings meant for Garuda. Hearing of this, 
Garuda beat Kaliya with his wing. In fear of 
Garuda, Kaliya fled for his life to the Yamuna 
river. 
 
In Vrindavan, the cows and cowherd boys 
being thirsty drank the Yamuna water 
contaminated with Kaliya's poison, and they 
all fell unconscious.  
 
Krishna brought them back to life by His 
merciful glance.  
Krishna then climbed onto a kadamba tree 
and jumped into the water. Kaliya enwrapped 
Krishna in his coils. 
 
Krishna then began playfully dancing about 
on Kaliya's hoods and trampled his one 
thousand hoods until his body slackened. 
 
 Seeing how very weary Kaliya had become, 
his wives bowed down at Krishna's lotus feet.  
 
Then they offered Him various prayers in 
hopes of gaining their husband's freedom. 
Satisfied by their prayers, Krishna released 
Kaliya. 
In 
a 
distressed 
voice, 
Kaliya 
acknowledged the offense he had committed 
and finally offered Krishna many prayers.  
 
Kishorlila-I 
Once, Krishna and His friends played a game 
where the losers would have to carry the 
winners on their shoulders. Pralambasura 
disguised himself as a cowherd boy and 
carried Balarama away.  
 
Balarama struck Pralambasura a ferocious 
blow on his head. Pralambasura repeatedly 
vomited blood and fell on the ground dead. 
One other day the cowherd boys became 
absorbed in sporting and the cows wandered 
into a dense forest. Suddenly a forest fire 
blazed up threatening both boys and the 
cows.  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Krishna swallowed up the fierce forest fire 
and saved His friends and cows.  
 
Every day early in the morning the young 
gopis would go to the Yamuna to bathe. Once, 
Krishna came there and took away all their 
garments and climbed a nearby kadamba 
tree. The gopis requested for their clothes.  
 
Following Krishna's instructions the Gopis 
got their clothes and satisfied Krishna.  
 
….once, the brahmanas' wives feed Krishna, 
Balarama and all the cowherd boys and 
attained the  
 
One day when Krishna saw the cowherd men 
preparing for a sacrifice to Lord Indra, He 
asked them to worship Govardhana.  
 
Lord Indra became very angry at the 
residents of Vraja for cancelling his sacrifice, 
so he sent forth devastating rains to punish 
them. To protect the residents of Vrindavana, 
Krishna lifted Govardhana Hill.  
 
 
Ashamed of having attacked Vrindavana with 
a violent storm, Indra begged for forgiveness 
from Krishna.  
 
Once, Nanda Maharaj decided to take his bath 
in Yamuna at the very end of the night. A 
servant of Varuna took Nanda Maharaj away 
to the demigod's abode. Not finding Nanda 
Maharaj, Krishna immediately went to see 
Varuna. There Varuna worshiped Krishna 
and released Nanda Maharaj. 
 
Desiring to enjoy pastimes during an autumn 
night Krishna began to play His flute.  
 
Kishorlila-II 
 
When the gopis heard the flute's sound, they 
immediately abandoned all their household 
duties and hastily went to meet Krishna.  
 
Wanting to please the gopis, Krishna 
responded to their appeals by playing with 
them in various pastimes.  
 
But when this show of attention made them a 
little proud, He humbled them by suddenly 
disappearing from the arena of the rasa 
dance. 
 
Not finding Krishna the gopis went back to 
the shore of the Yamuna and simply sang 
Krishna's glories in utter helplessness and 
enacted Krishna's pastimes.  
 
Later, while wandering in the forest, the 
gopis learned that Krishna had taken 
Radharani in seclusion.  
 
Because of the special attention Radharani 
received from Krishna, she felt proud. So 
Krishna 
disappeared, 
leaving 
Radharani 
alone. Then the gopis saw Radharani in 
separation of Krishna. 
 
When all the gopis were extremely disturbed 
by their separation from Krishna, Krishna 
appeared and consoled them.  
 
Then Krishna expanded Himself and danced 
with each of the gopis in the forests along the 
Yamuna River. 
 
 Gradually the gopis became fatigued from the 
continuous dancing and singing, and each of 
them enjoyed in the company of Krishna.  
 
Later, Krishna enjoyed with the gopis in the 
Yamuna River. 
 
 
 
 
 
Kishorlila-III 
 
Later, the cowherd men and their family 
members had gone to the Ambikavana forest 
to worship Lord Shiva. While sleeping there a 
hungry serpent began to swallow Nanda 
Maharaj. Krishna then touched the serpent 
with His lotus foot and the serpent was 
immediately freed from his reptilian body 
and appeared in his original form as a 
demigod. Thus, Nanda Maharaj was saved.  
 
Later, 
when 
Krishna 
and 
Balarama 
were enjoying pastimes in the forest with the 
young women of Vraja a demon named began 
abducting the gopīs. 
    
Kṛṣṇa chased after him and with a blow of 
His 
fist 
removed 
Shankhacuda's 
jewel, 
together with his head. 
 
Once everyone in Krishna's cowherd village 
became 
terrified 
when 
Aristasura 
approached it, but the Lord pacified them.  
    
Then Krishna grabbed Aristasura's horns and 
threw him to the ground and thrashed him 
like a pile of wet clothing. The demon 
vomited blood and gave up his life. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Wh
en Keshi demon tried to strike Krishna with 
his front legs, Krishna seized them and 
whirled the demon around. Krishna then 
thrust His left arm into the horse demon's 
mouth and expanded His arm choking the 
demon.  
    
In extreme agony Keshi gave up his life. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Mathuralila 
 
Following Kamsa's orders to bring Krishna 
and Balarama to Mathura, Akrura prepared 
his chariot and set off for Gokula. In Gokula, 
Akrura saw Krishna's lotus footprints on the 
path and embraced it. 
 
 When Akrura was taking Krishna and 
Balarama to Mathura from Gokula the 
cowherd girls began to chant Krishna's 
names and cried.  
 
The Gopis try to Stop Krishna and Balarama 
from leaving. 
 
On the way back to Mathura, Akrura stopped 
to bathe in the Yamuna. He was startled to 
see the two Lords standing in the water. 
When Akrura came out of the river he also 
saw them on the chariot. Then Akrura saw in 
the water four-armed Lord Vasudeva  and the 
demigods. Akrura joined his palms and began 
to pray to the Supreme Lord in a choked 
voice. 
 
On reaching Mathura, Krishna and Balarama 
took the cowherd boys with Them to see the 
splendorous city.  
 
As they all entered Mathura, the women of 
the city eagerly came out of their houses to 
see Krishna and Balarama.  
 
Krishna asked for some first-class garment 
from Kamsa's washerman, but he refused so 
Krishna became very angry and beheaded 
him with His fist.  
Krishna and Balarama then went to the house 
of the garland-maker Sudama, who adorned 
Them with garlands of fragrant flowers.  
    
Sudama worshiped Krishna and Balarama 
and chanted prayers in Their honor.  
    
The two Lords offered benedictions he 
wished and moved on. 
 
Krishna and Balarama then arrived at the 
arena where they saw a wonderful bow. 
Krishna forcibly picked up the bow, easily 
strung it and in an instant broke it in half. 
 
 At the gate of the wrestling arena Krishna 
and Balarama encountered Kuvalayapida 
elephant, who attacked Them. But Krishna 
yanked out one of the elephant's tusks and 
killed it. 
 
Krishna then grabbed Chanura's arms, 
whirled  him around several times and threw 
him to the  ground, killing him.  
 
Mushtika met a similar fate after being struck 
powerfully by Lord Baladeva's palm. 
 
 Krishna then leapt onto the lofty royal dais, 
grabbed Kamsa by the hair, hurled him down 
onto the floor of the wrestling ring and threw 
Himself on top of him.  
 
In this way, Kamsa met his death. Krishna and 
Balarama then met Mother Devaki and 
Vasudeva. King Ugrasena was enthrowned 
the king of Mathura. 
Krishna and Balarama then went to Garga 
Muni to take the vow of brahmacarya, 
celibacy. Sandipani Muni, pleased by Their 
service, 
imparted 
to 
Them 
detailed 
knowledge.  
 
Before taking leave of Their guru, Sandipani 
Muni 
seeing 
Their 
amazing 
prowess, 
requested Them to bring back his son, who 
had died in the ocean at Prabhasa. 
 
Krishna asked the ocean to return His 
spiritual master's son, and the lord of the 
ocean replied that a demon dwelling within 
the ocean named Pancajana had taken the 
boy away. Hearing this, Krishna entered the 
ocean, killed that demon. But when Krishna 
did not find His guru’s son within the 
demon's belly, He went to the planet of 
Yamaraja. 
Hearing 
Krishna's 
conchshell, 
Yamaraja came forward and Krishna asked 
for His guru’s son.  
 
On this Yamaraja immediately gave the son to 
Krishna and Balarama. 
Once, Krishna asked Uddhava to take news of 
Him to Vraja.  
 
When Uddhava reached Vraja, the gopis 
encircled Uddhava and spoke to him.  
 
One gopi, while meditating on Krishna, 
imagining the bee to be a messenger from 
Krishna begin to speak to the bee.  
 
She then declared that although Krishna may 
have abandoned the gopis, they could not 
possibly stop remembering Him for even a 
moment. Uddhava then consoled the gopis 
and returned to Mathura. 
Krishna then visited Trivakra, who offered 
Krishna sandalwood paste. Thus she attained 
the rare personal association of Krishna.  
 
Dwarkalila 
 
Knowing that Jarasandha and Kalayavana 
might 
endanger 
the 
Yadavas, 
Krishna 
constructed a wonderful Dwaraka city within 
the sea as a safe haven for the Yadavas. 
 
Once Kalayavana ran toward Krishna from 
behind, wanting to fight with Him. Krishna 
entered the cave, whereupon Kalayavana 
followed Krishna and saw a man lying on the 
ground. Thinking the sleeping man as 
Krishna, Kalayavana kicked him. The man 
stared harshly at him, igniting a fire in 
Kalayavana's body and in a moment burned 
him to ashes.  
 
 
The sleeping man was Mucukunda. Krishna 
told Mucukunda who He was and also offered 
him a boon.  
Later, when Jarasanda attached Dwarka, 
Krishna and Balarama climbed a mountain. 
Wanting to kill them Jarasanda set fire to the 
mountain, but Krishan and Balarama jumped 
from the mountain peak. 
 
Then a brahmana arrived at Dwarka bring  
the message of Rukminidevi for Krishna. 
Then Krishna immediately left to meet 
Rukminidevi. When Rukminidevi left the 
Ambika temple, Krishna took her onto His 
chariot. 
 
 
Rukminidevi's brother Rukmi, who hated 
Krishna, set out with his army to attack 
Krishna.  
 
 
When Krishna was about to kill him, 
Rukminidevi pleaded to spare her brother's 
life.  
 
Krishna did not kill Rukmi, but with His 
sword shaved off bits of Rukmi's hair here 
and there, leaving him disfigured. Krishna 
then took Rukminidevi to His capital, 
Dwaraka and married her.  
 
Later, Rukmini devi gave birth to Pradyumna, 
who was kiddnaped by Sambara demon, who 
threw Pradyumna into the ocean. A powerful 
fish swallowed Pradyumna. The fish was 
caught by a fishmen. The fisherman gave the 
fish to the King, who sent the fish to his 
kitchen. When the cook cut open the fish, he 
found a Pradyumna within its belly.  
 
Within a very short time, Pradyumna grew to 
youthful maturity, and married Ratideva. 
Pradyumna then killed Shambara demon and 
returned to Dwarka. 
Later, Krishna recovered the Syamantaka 
jewel to allay false accusations against Him 
and married the daughters of Jambavan and 
Satrajit.  
 
In an arena Krishna subdued the seven bulls 
and married the daughter of King Nagnajit.  
 
 
Subsequently, Krishna married Bhadra, and 
Laksmana. 
 
 After 
Narakasura 
stole 
Lord 
Varuna's 
umbrella 
and 
mother 
Aditi's 
earrings, 
Krishna with Queen Satyabhama went to the 
demon's kingdom and decapitated the Mura 
demon with His disc.  
 
Naraka threw his shakti lance at Krishna, but 
the weapon proved ineffective.  
 
Krishna cut the demon's entire army to 
pieces. Finally, with His sharp-edged disc 
Krishna cut off Narakasura's head. Then 
Krishna married the 16,000 maidens whom 
the demon had kidnapped and held captive. 
 
 
Activities in Dwaraka 
 
One day Krishna sat at ease in Queen 
Rukmini's bedroom and provoked anger in 
her with joking words.  
 
Rukminidevi began to cry, and soon she 
became stunned in extreme fear, pain and 
sadness and fell unconscious.  
 
Krishna then lifted Rukimi devi and consoled 
her. 
 
Banasura was a faithful follower of Lord 
Shiva.  
 
Once Usha, the daughter of Banasura 
kidnapped Krishna's grandson, Aniruddha 
who was then captured by Banasura. 
 
 Krishna attacked Banasura and Lord Shiva 
joined with his associates. Krishna cut off 
Banasura's arms. Then Shiva approached 
Krishna and prayed for Banasura's life. On the 
request of Lord Shiva, Krishna did not kill 
Banasura but instead blessed him that he will 
be free from old age and death, and remain 
fearless in all circumstances. 
 
Later, Krishna arranged for His son's and 
daughter's marriage, and during Aniruddha's 
marriage ceremony, Balarama killed Rukmi.  
 
Once Krishna released King Nriga from a 
curse and instructed the royal order on the 
great 
danger 
of 
taking 
a 
brahmana's 
property. 
 
 
King 
Nriga 
then 
offered 
his 
repeated 
obeisances to Krishna. 
 
Dvivida, who was a friend of Narakasura, 
wanted to avenge the death of his friend. 
Dvivida kidnapped men and women and  
imprisoned them in mountain caves, which 
he sealed off with boulders. 
 Around the same time Balarama visited 
Gokula to see His relatives and friends. There 
He enjoyed the company of the cowherd girls.  
 
Wandering about the forest Balarama pulled 
the Yamuna, when she ignored His command. 
Then the goddess Yamuna appeared, and 
prayed for forgiveness.  
 
The Lord let her go and then enjoyed in her 
waters. 
 At that time Dvivida made crude gestures to 
the women. Dvivida's outrageous behavior 
angered Balarama. Balarama struck Dvivida's 
throat and shoulder, at which point the ape 
vomited blood and died. 
 
While Balarama was visiting Vraja, King 
Paundraka encouraged by fools, announced 
that he was the real Vasudeva. Hearing this, 
Krishna went to Kashi to fight him.  
 
 
Seeing Krishna, Paundraka quickly came out 
of the city with his army. Krishna annihilated 
the armies of Paundraka and Kashiraja, 
beheaded Paundraka and Kashiraja and 
returned to Dwarka. 
Narada Muni wanted to observe Lord 
Krishna's diverse activities in His unique 
family situation so he visited Dwaraka.  
 
Narada Muni was amazed to see the 
household pastimes of Lord Krishna. 
 
 
 
Later, when Krishna visited Indraprastha the 
Pandavas celebrated Lord Krishna's arrival 
with great festivity.  
 
Lord Krishna received the honor of first 
worship 
during 
the 
Rajasuya 
sacrifice. 
Shishupala, could not tolerate this and he 
continued to blaspheme Lord Krishna. Then 
Krishna decapitated Shishupala with His disc.  
 
At that moment an effulgent spark of light 
rose out of Shishupala's dead body and 
entered the transcendental body of Lord 
Krishna.  
 
After 
the 
Rajasuya 
sacrifice, 
Prince 
Duryodhana 
was 
humiliated 
in 
King 
Yudhisthira's palace. 
Shalva who had been defeated at the time of 
Rukminidevi's marriage attacked Dwaraka in 
Lord Krishna's absence. When Lord Krishna 
returned to Dwaraka, He took up His disc and 
severed Shalva's head. At that time the 
demigods in the sky played kettledrums in 
jubilation.  
 
Final pastimes 
 
When Balarama heard that the Pandavas and 
Kauravas were about to go to war, He left 
Dwaraka on the pretext of going on 
pilgrimage. Greatly angered by Romaharsana 
Suta's offense, Balarama killed him with the 
tip of a blade of kusha grass. 
 
The bramanas requested Balarama to kill 
Killed demon Balvala, who had been polluting 
the sacrificial arena. 
 
To satisfy the request of the brahmanas at 
Naimisharanya, Lord Balarama immediately 
dragged him Balvala down with His plow and 
angrily smashed the demon's head with His 
club.  
 
Once, Krishna's childhood friend, Sudama, 
visited Dwaraka seeking charity. Seeing him 
from a distance, Krishna immediately rose 
from His seat and greeted Sudama with great 
joy.  Krishna then sat Sudama down on the 
bed and washed his feet with His own hands.  
 
The poor brahmana was ashamed to present 
Krishna with his meager gift of flat rice.  
    
Krishna then took the hand of His friend, and 
the two of them reminisced about the things 
they had done together long ago, while living 
in the school of their spiritual master. 
 
 Sudama pointed out that Krishna engages in 
the pastime of acquiring education only to set 
an example for human society. 
Later, hearing that a total eclipse of the sun 
was soon to occur people from all over 
Bharata-varsa, 
including 
the 
Yadavas, 
converged at Kuruksetra to earn special 
pious credit.  
 
There Krishna met Nanda Maharaj and the 
other residents of Vrindavana and gave them 
great joy. 
Once, wanting to kidnap Subhadra and marry 
her, Arjuna disguised himself as a renunciant 
and went to Dwaraka.  
 
Balarama was at first greatly angered to hear 
of this, but when Krishna and other family 
members pacified Him, He became joyful and 
sent the bride and groom off with elaborate 
wedding gifts. 
 
Once when Krishna and Arjuna wanting to 
recover the dead sons of brahmana, came to 
the water of the Causal Ocean, where they 
saw the thousand-hooded serpent Ananta 
and upon Him lay Maha-Vishnu.  
 
Krishna and Arjuna took the brahmana's sons 
and went back to Dwaraka and returned the 
infants to their father. 
 
Krishna 
expertly 
arranged 
the 
great 
Kuruksetra battle between the Kurus  and the 
Pandavas and thus removed the earth's 
burden to a great extent. 
 
 Once, the sages cursed the Yadu family boys 
when they playfull dressed Samba as a 
pregnant woman and inquired from the sages 
about the fruitfulness of the pregnancy.  
 
The sages cursed the mocking boys by saying, 
"She will give birth to a club that will destroy 
your family." Fearing the brahmana's curse, 
King Ugrasena ordered the club ground to 
powder and thrown into the ocean.  
 
Yadavas abandoned Dwaraka and went to 
Prabhasa. There they became absorbed in 
festivity, and by the illusory power of Krishna 
they became intoxicated from drinking 
liquor.  
    
Thus losing their intelligence, they quarreled 
among themselves and began killing one 
another, until not a man was left alive. 
 
Afterward, Lord Balarama went to the shore 
of the ocean and by the mystic strength of 
yoga gave up His body. 
Once when Krishna sat down silently upon 
the ground, He instructed Uddhava.  
 
Later, a hunter mistaking the sole of the 
Lord's foot for a deer, pierced it with an 
arrow. The hunter immediately understood 
his mistake and, falling at the feet of Lord 
Krishna begged to be punished.  
 
In reply Lord Krishna told the hunter that 
what he had done was actually according to 
His own desire. Then Lord Krishna returned 
to His own abode, along with all the Yadus.
